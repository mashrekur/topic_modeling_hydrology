Abstract = {{This paper examines the possibility of an association between winter
   (December-March) snowfall in New England and sea surface temperature
   anomalies (SSTAs) in the adjacent Atlantic Ocean. Regional snowfall
   indices for southern and northern New England were obtained by rotated
   principal components analysis (PCA). Composite maps of winter Atlantic
   SSTAs and 700-mb geopotential height anomalies were generated for cases
   of above and below average winter snowfall totals for southern and
   northern New England, respectively. A monthly index of SSTAs around the
   coast of New England was obtained from rotated PCA of SSTAs in the
   western Atlantic Ocean and compared for high snow and low snow cases.
   In northern New England, no direct association between snowfall and
   SSTAs is indicated by either the composite maps or the monthly SSTA.
   index - high or low snowfall totals can be attributed primarily to
   anomalies in the 700-mb circulation. In southern New England, high (low)
   snowfall totals are associated with negative (positive) SSTAs off the
   Atlantic coast, and these anomalies are often already evident in
   December, suggesting Atlantic sea surface temperatures may be of utility
   in long-range winter forecasts for coastal regions.}},

Abstract = {{Pathways and fate of road deicing salt (NaCl) applied during the
   1994-1995 winter were studied for a 14-km section of a major highway
   that crosses the Oak Ridges Moraine in southern Ontario. Total salt
   applications over the winter ranged from 29 to 74 kg m(-1) of highway,
   and NaCl concentrations in snow banks adjacent to the roadway reached
   9400 mg l(-1) during the later stages of snow cover development. This
   salt was released to the ground surface during snowmelt. Sodium chloride
   (NaCl) loadings to soil from snow cover during the final melt phase were
   relatively uniform along the study section (3-5 kg NaCl m(-1) of
   highway). However, the snowpack at all transects retained <50\% of
   applied NaCl, and this shortfall probably reflected direct runoff and
   infiltration of saline meltwater from the road surface into the adjacent
   shoulder and right-of-way. Cation exchange with Ca2+ in near-surface
   soils most likely resulted in preferential retention of Na+ relative to
   Cl-, although total storage of NaCl in upper soil horizons by winter's
   end was <15\% of deicing salt applications. An environmental tracer
   (O-18) was used to trace movement of saline meltwater through the
   unsaturated zone underlying the highway. Average meltwater particle
   velocities at a site underlain by loam soils were 0.02 m d(-1), and ca.
   280 mm of water was displaced below a depth of 1.86 m over a 78-day
   period in the spring and summer of 1995. Sodium ion and chloride ion
   concentrations in water sampled in late summer 1995 at depths >2 m
   exceeded 500 mg l(-1) and 1000 mg l(-1), respectively. Approximately
   75\% of the net flux of NaCl below the upper soil was retained in the
   0-2.8 m depth interval at this site, and results from more permeable
   soils traversed by the highway indicate an even greater penetration of
   the annual NaCl application into the unsaturated zone along the moraine.
   This saline water likely recharges groundwater in this portion of the
   Oak Ridges Moraine.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the rate of snowmelt and intercepted snow sublimation in
   boreal forests requires an understanding of the effects of snow-covered
   conifers on the exchange of radiant energy. This study examined the
   amount of intercepted snow on a jack pine canopy in the boreal forest of
   central Saskatchewan and the shortwave and net radiation exchange with
   this canopy, to determine the effect of intercepted snow and canopy
   structure on shortwave radiation reflection and extinction and net
   radiation attenuation in st boreal forest. The study focused on clear
   sky conditions, which are common during winter in the continental boreal
   forest. Intercepted snow was found to have no influence on the clear-sky
   albedo of the canopy, the extinction of short wave radiation by the
   canopy or ratio of net radiation at the canopy top to that at the
   surface snow cover. Because of the low albedo of the snow-covered
   canopy, net radiation at the canopy top remains positive and a large
   potential source of energy for sublimation. The canopy albedo declines
   somewhat as the extinction efficiency of the underlying canopy
   increases. The extinction efficiency of short wave radiation in the
   canopy depends on solar angle because of the approximately horizontal
   orientation of pine branches. For low solar angles above the horizon,
   the extinction efficiency is quite low and short wave transmissivity
   through the canopy is relatively high. As the solar angle increases,
   extinction increases up to angles of about 50 degrees, and then
   declines. Extinction of short wave radiation in the canopy strongly
   influences the attenuation of net radiation by the canopy. Short wave
   radiation that is extinguished by branches is radiated as long wave,
   partly downwards to the snow cover. The ratio of net radiation at the
   canopy top to that at the snow cover surface increases with the
   extinction of short wave radiation and is negative for low extinction
   efficiencies. For the pine canopy examined, the daily mean net radiation
   at the snow cover surface became positive when daily mean solar angles
   exceeded 22 degrees in late March. Hence, canopy structure and solar
   angle control the net radiation at the snow cover surface during clear
   sky conditions and will govern the timing and rate of snowmelt. Models
   of intercepted snow sublimation and forest snowmelt could beneficially
   incorporate the canopy radiation balance, which can be extrapolated to
   stands of various canopy densities, coverage and heights in a physically
   based manner. Such models could hence avoid `empirical' temperature
   index measures that cannot be extrapolated with confidence.}},

Abstract = {{The use of radars to characterize the physical properties of a snow
   cover offers an attractive alternative to manual snow pit measurements.
   Radar techniques are non-invasive and have the potential to cover large
   areas of a snow-covered terrain. A promising radar technique for snow
   cover studies is the frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar.
   The use of a multiband radar approach for snow cover studies was
   investigated in order to fully exploit the capabilities of FMCW radars.
   FMCW radars operating at and near the C-, X- and K-a-bands were used to
   obtain radar profiles over a wide range of snow cover conditions. These
   frequency-dependent radar signatures were used to identify important
   snow cover features such as ice and depth boar layers. Snow grain size
   information was also obtained from the frequency-dependent scattering
   losses that were observed in the snow cover. Several case studies of
   FMCW radar profiles are presented in order to demonstrate the advantages
   of a multiband radar approach for monitoring the spatial and temporal
   variability of snow cover properties and/or processes over an extended
   area.}},

Abstract = {{The Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) radiometer is a useful tool
   for monitoring snow wetness on a large scare because water content has a
   significant effect on the microwave emissions at the snowpack surface.
   To date, SSM/I snow wetness algorithms, based on statistical regression
   analysis, have been developed only for specific regions. Inadequate
   ground-based snow wetness measurements and the non-linearity between
   SSM/I brightness temperatures (T(B)s) and snow wetness over varied
   vegetation covered terrain has impeded the development of a general
   model. In this study, we used a previously developed linear relationship
   between snowpack surface wetness (\% by volume) and concurrent air
   temperature (degrees C) to estimate the snow wetness at ground weather
   stations. The snow condition (snow free, dry, wet or refrozen snow) of
   each SSM/I pixel (a 37 x 29 km area at 37.0 GHz) was determined from
   ground-measured weather data and the T-B signature. SSM/I T(B)s of wet
   snow were then linked with the snow wetness estimates as an input/output
   relationship. A single-hidden-layer back-propagation (backprop)
   artificial neural network (ANN) was designed to learn the relationships.
   After training, the snow wetness values estimated by the ANN were
   compared with those derived by regression models. Results show that the
   ANN performed better than the existing regression models in estimating
   snow wetness from SSM/I data over terrain with different amounts of
   vegetation cover.}},

Abstract = {{Interception and recharge processes beneath a Pinus elliotii forest were
   considered in an integrated study. In the study area, annual rainfall
   was divided into throughfall (74.45\%), stemflow (9.37\%) and
   interception (16.28\%). Throughfall and stemflow infiltrate into the
   soil in different ways. The results show that trees can affect the
   recharge characteristics by providing throughfall as a non-point source
   and stemflow as a point source, and also through their influence on
   infiltration processes by making the hydraulic conductivity of soil
   heterogeneous. In the root zone there was a divergent zero flux plane
   recharged by macropore flow during heavy rain and a convergent zero flux
   plane caused by transpiration during dry periods.}},

Abstract = {{Tracers provide one of the few ways of obtaining realistic information
   on the hows of water and solutes in undisturbed structured soils. Three
   fluorinated organic acids {[}pentafluorobenzoic acid, 2,6-diflurobenzoic
   acid and o-(trifluoromethyl) benzoic acid] and bromide were tested as
   anionic tracers in situations where the separation of different flow
   components is of interest. The fluorobenzoates were relatively
   conservative (approximately 90\% for loam soil) although, in some
   instances, co-elution or complexation may lead to apparently
   non-conservative behaviour. Tracer mixtures applied to soils, were
   separated and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography.
   The relative mobilities of the tracers were studied during
   unidirectional steady flow in large undisturbed soil columns brought
   back to the laboratory. The breakthrough curves showed highly dispersive
   behaviour, with very early breakthrough of solute and a long tail.
   Contributions to the column outflow of different simultaneous
   applications of rainfall and return flow, labelled with different
   tracers, were separated using multicomponent mixing equations. The
   results show the importance of preferential flow and relatively immobile
   storage in the transport process.}},

Abstract = {{A series of experiments designed to study the separation of how
   components from two large undisturbed cores under steady-state rainfall
   (downward) and return (upward) hows under near-saturated conditions is
   summarized. The experiments were conducted on soil columns collected
   from Lancaster University and the Slapton Wood catchment, Devon. The use
   of the relatively conservative tracers, potassium bromide,
   o-(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid and 2,6-difluorobenzoic acid and a
   combination of application rates made it possible to quantify the
   different sources of water contributing to the discharge hydrographs.
   There is significant retention of tracer within the cores, despite the
   application of several pore volumes of water.
   The use of steady flow conditions allowed the determination of
   dispersion coefficients, dispersivity and proportion of `mobile' water
   content parameters of the advection-dispersion equation. It was found
   that there were significant differences between the dispersivities at
   different flow-rates under upward and downward flux conditions and that
   in the undisturbed cores studied here the apparent proportions of mobile
   pore water ranged between 0.33 and 1.0, with an apparently complex
   relationship to flux rate. Prediction of transport in undisturbed soil
   remains problematic and tracer experiments will continue to be needed to
   provide a fundamental understanding of the complex flow processes
   involved.}},

Abstract = {{Solute transport through structured, undisturbed soil has been studied
   in transient, unsaturated experiments using columns from grass and
   woodland sites on the Lancaster University campus. Three anionic tracers
   have been used, bromide (Br-) and two fluorinated organic acids
   (pentraflurobenzoic acid and 2,6-diflurobenzoic acid). The process of
   displacement of stored water from undisturbed columns was investigated
   using successive inputs of different tracers under similar antecedent
   conditions. The results indicated that initial breakthrough was rapid,
   with a relative concentration of 0.8 being reached between 0.4 and 0.5
   pore volumes of discharge. It was found that there was an apparent
   continued discharge of `old' water, stored in the column before any
   additions of tracer, even after the addition of a total of 4.9 and 5.4
   pore volumes of water for the grass and woodland columns, respectively.
   The implications of the results of these tracer studies for modelling
   solute transport in structured soils are considered.}},

Abstract = {{As reliable estimates of stream nutrient transport are required for many
   purposes including trend analysis, mass balances and model development,
   the impact of sampling strategy and estimation method on the bias and
   precision of stream nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) transport
   calculations was evaluated. The study was undertaken in two catchments
   in eastern Denmark. Selection of the most accurate sampling strategy and
   estimation method, i.e. with the lowest root mean square error (RMSE)
   was based on random (Monte Carlo) runs for generating replicate data
   sets from an essentially complete record of the concentration of total N
   (TN), total P (TP), particulate P (PP) and dissolved P (DP) during a
   two-year period (June 1987 to June 1989). The evaluation comprised 13
   different estimation methods and seven discrete sampling strategies
   involving three categories (regular, stratified and strata sampling).
   The regular sampling strategies were more accurate (lower RMSE) during
   high-flow periods than stratified sampling. The greatest improvement in
   RMSE for TN, TP, PP and DP transport was obtained when increasing the
   sampling frequency from 12 each year (monthly) to 18 (monthly in summer
   and fortnightly in winter) and 26 each year (fortnightly). The increase
   in accuracy (RMSE) was less when increasing the sampling frequency to 52
   (weekly) or 104 (biweekly).
   Nearly all the methods evaluated underestimated the annual transport of
   TP and PP, whereas TN and DP were both under- and overestimated. The
   best method of estimating N and P transport when utilizing discrete
   sampling was both site- and time-dependent. The overall best and most
   reproducible (stream to stream, year to year) method for estimating
   annual transport of TN, TP, PP and DP was a linear interpolation method.
   When this method was used to derive estimates of annual TN and TP
   transport based on fortnightly sampling, the RMSE was 1.4-5.4 and
   20.2-38.5\%, respectively, in the Gelbaek stream and 1.1-4.9 and
   10.5-15.0\%, respectively, in the Gjern Angstrom stream. Subdividing the
   hydrograph into two strata (low-how and high-flow periods) and sampling
   these strata separately for calculating TP transport was superior to
   discrete sampling for the smaller of the two catchments. A combination
   of regular sampling (monthly) and pooled high-flow sampling (eight
   events out of a total of 43) reduced the RMSE of the annual TP load to
   10.4\%.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of a two-dimensional, raster-based rainfall-runoff
   model, CASC2D, with a raster geographical information system (GIS),
   GRASS, offers enhanced capabilities for analysing the hydrological
   impact under a variety of land management scenarios. The spatially
   varied components of the watershed, such as slope, soil texture, surface
   roughness and land-use disturbance, were characterized in GRASS at a
   user-specified grid cell resolution for input into the CASC2D model.
   CASC2D is a raster-based, single-event rainfall-runoff model that
   divides the watershed into grid cell elements and simulates the
   hydrological processes of infiltration, overland how and channel flow in
   response to distributed rainfall precipitation. The five-step
   integration of CASC2D and GRASS demonstrates the potential for analysing
   spatially and temporally varied hydrological processes within a 50
   square mile semiarid watershed. By defining possible land-use
   disturbance scenarios for the watershed, a variety of rainfall-runoff
   events were simulated to determine the changes in watershed response
   under varying disturbance and rainfall conditions. Additionally,
   spatially distributed infiltration outputs derived from the simulations
   were analysed in GRASS to determine the variability of hydrological
   change within the watershed. Grid cell computational capabilities in
   GRASS allow the user to combine the scenario simulation outputs with
   other distributed watershed parameters to develop complex maps depicting
   potential areas of hydrological sensitivity. This GIS-hydrological model
   integration provides valuable spatial information to researchers and
   managers concerned with the study and effects of land-use on
   hydrological response.}},

Abstract = {{The relations between water-table depth in a shallow forest soil and
   topographic characteristics derived from a raster digital elevation
   model (DEM) were studied. Water-table depths at times of observation,
   and peak levels between times of observation, were measured weekly
   during an autumn-winter rainy season at 59 wells in a catchment (ca 0.04
   km(2)) drained by an ephemeral stream, located 80 km east of Vancouver,
   Canada. Digital elevation models with grid spacings of 4, 8 and 16 m
   were derived from a ground survey and values of a (upslope contributing
   area per unit contour length), tan beta (surface slope) and chi (a
   measure of surface curvature) were computed from the DEMs. To avoid
   problems with data censoring when the water-table dropped below the
   bottom of some wells, the depths were discretized into classes and
   discriminant analysis was used to relate water-table depth classes to
   the topographic indices. The relations were derived using data from 30
   wells and were tested on data from the other 29 wells to provide an
   independent test of predictive capability.
   The index In(alpha/tan beta) provided more reliable classifications than
   a multiple discriminant analysis using In(alpha), tan beta and chi as
   separate predictor variables. Water-table depths at some wells were
   consistently misclassified (e.g. 0-3\% correct classifications), whereas
   at others they were classified correctly in up to 100\% of cases.
   Consistent misclassification at individual wells could reflect either
   the effects of errors in the derived topographic indices (through errors
   in the DEM or the algorithms used to calculate the indices) or phenomena
   not related to surface topography, such as variability in soil
   properties or differences between the surface topography and the
   topography of the base of the soil profile. The predictive accuracy and
   statistical significance of derived relations decreased as the DEM grid
   size increased from 4 to 8 to 16 m. These results are valid only for
   predictions of water-table depths at points. Further research should
   explore the effect of grid scale on relations between grid-averaged
   water-table depths and topographic indices and on methods to
   parameterize subgrid-scale variability.}},

Abstract = {{Rainfall was simulated on unconfined plots on regolith in debris flow
   source areas using a portable simulator. In total, 351 simulations were
   carried out on steep slopes (27-54 degrees) with rainfall intensities of
   28-291 mm/h. From these rainfall simulations the infiltration parameters
   sorptivity (S) and steady-state infiltration capacity (K) of the
   regolith, and a threshold for the occurrence of micro-scale mass
   movements, were obtained. Two evaluation methods were used to obtain the
   infiltration parameters K and S. The `infiltration envelope' method uses
   rainfall intensity and time to ponding from multiple tests and fits an
   infiltration envelope through the data from which K and S can be
   obtained. The `constant runoff method uses rainfall intensity and
   overland flow intensity to calculate K, after which S can be calculated
   in several ways by using time to pending. The constant runoff method
   produced K values of 16.6-128 mm/h, which usually show a log-normal
   distribution. K values depend on the regolith parent material and
   rainfall intensity. Using this method, S values are 0.088-0.381
   cm/min(1/2). The infiltration envelope method produced K values of
   9.8-131 mm/h and S values of 0.14-0.32 cm/min(1/2). It can be argued
   that both methods overestimate K as well as S, but quantitative
   relations between measured/calculated and actual values of K and S have
   not yet been obtained. At high rainfall intensities, typically 100 mm/h
   or more, micro-scale mass movements sometimes occur. A lower threshold
   curve for the occurrence of these micro-scale mass movements has been
   constructed. It is a function of both slope angle and rainfall
   intensity. The micro-scale mass movements could play an important part
   in the initiation of debris flows in the study area, possibly by
   delivering sediment to overland flow. On the very steep slopes, the
   sediment-rich overland flow can easily mobilize coarse material.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Applications of hydrological models to northern wetland-dominated
   regions have been limited in the past to a few case studies on small
   basins employing `lumped' models. Only recently have there been attempts
   to apply the grouped response unit (GRU) distributed modelling approach
   using terrain classifications to these same basins. This study
   summarizes recent efforts in applying such a model. For the purposes of
   implementing the GRU approach, terrain types that are hydrologically
   significant and characteristic to the wetland-dominated regime were
   successfully discriminated using a principal component analysis and a
   hybrid unsupervised/supervised classification technique on
   Landsat-Thematic Mapper imagery. The terrain classifications were then
   used as input into a distributed hydrological model for calibration and
   validation using recorded spring runoff events. Preliminary model
   applications, and results are described. Calibration to a historic
   spring runoff event yielded an r(2) value of 0.86. Model validation,
   however, yielded much poorer results. The problems of model
   applicability to this region and limitations of sparse data networks are
   highlighted. The need for more held research in this type of
   hydrological regime, and associated improvements to the model parameter
   set are also identified.}},

Abstract = {{Peatlands do not readily return to functional wetland ecosystems after
   harvesting (cutting), because the harsh hydrological and microclimatic
   conditions are unsuitable for Sphagnum regeneration. In this study,
   drainage ditches blocked after harvesting restored the water balance to
   a condition similar to a nearby natural bog. Evaporation averaged 2.9
   and 2.7 mm day(-1) on the cutover and natural bog, respectively.
   Evaporation consumed most of the rainfall input (86 and 80\%,
   respectively), whereas runoff was minor at both sites (6 and 4\%,
   respectively). However, the water table position was markedly different
   at these sites. Median water table depth was 0.05 m below the surface in
   the natural bog, compared with 0.44 m in the cutover bog (ditches
   blocked). Changes to the peak soil matrix owing to drainage and cutting
   reduced the specific yield (Sy) of the peat to 0.04-0.06 from 0.35-0.55,
   causing exaggerated water table changes in the cutover site.
   Nevertheless, volumetric soil moisture in the cutover site (0.67 +/-
   .08) had low variability, and was maintained above moisture contents
   found in Sphagnum hummocks in the natural bog (0.48 +/- .10), although
   less than on Sphagnum lawn(0.84 +/- .11). Poor Sphagnum regeneration on
   cutover surfaces can therefore be attributed to its inability to extract
   water from the underlying peat, which retains water at matric suction
   greater than the nonvascular Sphagnum can generate.
   The corrupted iron pan under main ditches has permitted partial recharge
   of the underlying aquifer, reducing local hydraulic gradients, thereby
   decreasing vertical seepage loss.}},

Abstract = {{Lake evaporation has been estimated for a shallow lake using a
   combination of water and isotope mass balance, accounting for the
   isotopic non-steady state of lake water. The main feature of the isotope
   method is that inflows need not be measured. Knowledge of their isotopic
   content is sufficient. Oxygen-18 content, i.e. (delta(18)O), of lake
   water, inflows and outflow was measured on a weekly basis, whereas for
   precipitation it was monitored daily. The discharge from the lake was
   also recorded daily. Lake water level, relative humidity, air, and lake
   water surface temperatures were recorded by a logger. The weather data
   were recorded on a small island in the lake. It was observed that the
   lake is isotopically well mixed. Furthermore, the atmospheric moisture
   was not always in isotopic equilibrium with the precipitation. Daily
   lake evaporation was estimated as an average of six to eight days
   depending upon the field logistics. Lake evaporation varied from 0.6 to
   about 5.4 mm/day during the experimental period. It was found that
   evaporation estimates are very sensitive to small variations in
   delta(18)O of lake evaporate. Induced changes of 10\% in delta(18)O of
   lake evaporate caused errors in evaporation estimates of 9-31\%, while
   similar induced changes in delta(18)O Of inflows caused errors of
   8-18\%. Thus, an accurate experimental determination of delta(18)O of
   lake evaporate is relatively more important.}},

Abstract = {{The results of a field study of the small-scale spatial structure of the
   depth of shallow seasonal snowcovers in prairie and arctic environments
   are presented. It is shown that the spatial distribution of snow depth
   is fractal at small scales, becoming random at scales beyond some
   limiting length. This is due to the autocorrelation of depth at small
   sampling distances. The transition of fractal to random behaviour is
   indexed by a `cutoff length', which is defined by the intersection of
   the `fractal' slope and horizontal tangent of a logarithmic plot of the
   standard deviation of depth versus sampling distance.
   The magnitude of the cutoff length is related to the degree of
   macroscopic variability of the underlying topography. An increase in
   length due to the effects of macroscopic topographic variability on
   snowcover accumulation is confirmed by de-trending held measurements.
   The de-trended data shown a cutoff length for wheat stubble and fallow
   surfaces of approximately 30 m, which is consistent with the distance
   determined from measurements on `flat' fields.
   The implications of the transition of snow depth from fractal to random
   structure on the scales of snow sampling and modelling are presented.
   The cutoff length may provide a statistic for stratifying shallow
   snowcovers, by linking snowcover properties to the underlying
   topography.}},

Abstract = {{Snow interception in a coniferous stand leads to considerable
   short-range variability in snowcover depth, which in turn affects the
   water and heat regime of the soil. To study the coupling between snow
   accumulation, frost penetration, and hydrological response, plot-scale
   experiments were conducted in a subalpine spruce forest. The stony,
   sandy-loamy Spodosol was highly permeable and had an organic layer of
   5-15 cm thickness. Within two plots, one underneath a tree crown and one
   in a canopy gap, we measured near-surface runoff, soil temperature, and
   liquid water content. Snow and frost depths varied more in space than
   between two winter periods at given locations. Frost penetration was
   greater near the trunk, where a higher portion of snowmelt water drained
   downslope close to the surface than in the gap due to frost-induced
   reduction of infiltration. In both years, the spring snowmelt occurred
   over two distinct periods. During the first snowmelt, the water
   percolated primarily through the frozen layer and part of it probably
   refroze within the frozen layer, thereby raising the total water and ice
   content. During the second event, near-surface runoff was more
   pronounced.}},

Abstract = {{Earlier modelling studies have shown the difficulty of accurately
   simulating snowmelt infiltration into frozen soil using the hydraulic
   model approach. Comparison of model outputs and held measurements have
   inferred the occurrence of rapid flow even during periods when the soil
   is still partly frozen. A one-dimensional, physically based soil water
   and heat model (SOIL) has been complemented with a new two-domain
   approach option to simulate preferential flow through frozen layers. The
   ice is assumed to be first formed at the largest water filled pore upon
   freezing. Infiltrating water may be conducted rapidly through previously
   air-filled pores which are not occupied by ice; A minor fraction of
   water is slowly transferred within the liquid water domain, which is
   absorbed by the solid particles. A model validation with field
   measurements at a location in the middle-east of Sweden indicated that
   the two-domain approach was suitable for improving the prediction of
   drainage during snowmelting. In particular, the correlation between
   simulated and observed onset of drainage in spring was improved. The
   validation also showed that the effect of the high flow domain was
   highly sensitive to the degree of saturation in the topsoil during
   freezing, as well as to the hydraulic properties at the lower frost
   boundary regulating the upward water flow to the frozen soil and ice
   formation.}},

Abstract = {{An atmosphere-ocean climate box model is used to examine the influence
   of cloud feedback on the equilibria of the climate system. The model
   consists of three non-linear ordinary differential equations, which are
   simplified forms of the first law of thermodynamics for the atmosphere
   and ocean and the continuity equation for the atmospheric component of
   the hydrological cycle. The mass continuity equation expresses the cloud
   liquid water content as a function of the evaporation rate from the
   ocean surface and the precipitation rate. Cloud formation releases
   latent heat. The model clouds also absorb solar energy at a rate
   consistent with recent findings. The model simulates snow-ice albedo
   feedback, water vapour feedback and cloud feedback. The global mean
   precipitation and surface temperature are analysed as they respond to
   enhanced greenhouse warming. Model results show that cloud feedback can
   lead to the occurrence of multiple climate equilibria. Some of these are
   warmer than the present equilibrium, with increased precipitation, while
   others are colder, with reduced precipitation. If the cloud feedback is
   weak, enhanced greenhouse forcing leads to a small alteration of the
   present equilibrium. If the cloud feedback is strong enough, the climate
   system can be forced into a warmer and wetter equilibrium.}},

Abstract = {{Process-based, distributed-area snowmelt runoff models operating at
   small scales are essential to understand subtle effects of climate
   change, but require data not commonly available. Temperature index
   models operating over large areas provide realistic simulations of basin
   runoff with operationally available data, but lack rigorous physically
   based algorithms. A compromise between the two types of models is
   required to provide realistic evaluations of basin response to
   environmental changes in cold regions. One adaptation that is uniformly
   required for snowmelt models is the use of remotely sensed data, either
   as input or in model validation. At a minimum, snowmelt forecasting
   models need to incorporate snowcover extent information, which is
   currently obtained operationally. As more remote sensing capabilities
   come on line, models should accept upgraded information on snow water
   equivalent; additional remotely sensed information on landcover, frozen
   soil, soil moisture, cloudiness and albedo would also be useful.
   Adaptations to the semi-distributed snowmelt runoff model (SRM) are
   underway to make it more physically based for use in large area studies.
   A net radiation index has been added to the model, which formerly used
   only a temperature (degree-day) index to melt snow from a basin's
   elevation zones. The addition of radiation to the SRM allows the basin
   to be subdivided into hydrological response units by general aspect
   (orientation) as well as elevation. Testing of the new radiation-based
   SRM with measured radiation from a small research basin is the first
   step towards large scale simulations. Results from the W-3 research
   basin in Vermont, USA are promising. In the radiation version, the
   factor that multiplies the degree-day index is estimated independently
   of model output and is held constant throughout the season, in contrast
   with the degree-day version, where the corresponding factor is allowed
   to increase throughout the season. Without calibrating or optimizing on
   this important parameter, the goodness-of-fit measure R(2) is improved
   in two out of six test years when the radiation version of the SRM is
   used in place of the degree-day version in melt season simulations. When
   the accumulation of error is eliminated with periodic updating of
   streamflow, more significant improvement is noted with radiation
   included.}},

Abstract = {{Several possible effects of blowing snow on the atmospheric boundary
   layer are investigated, mostly within the general framework of the
   Prairie Blowing Snow Model (PBSM). The processes of snow saltation and
   suspension are first described. Variations to the drift density profile
   are tested and the effects of stratification and density variation
   calculations are evaluated. Despite high density gradients of blowing
   snow, stratification effects on turbulence and the velocity profiles can
   generally be neglected. However, with saltating or suspended snow in a
   constant shear stress layer, part of the shear stress is carried by the
   particles. A highly simplified, single-phase approach, based on the
   density variation of the air-snow mixture coupled to a simple turbulent
   stress-strain relationship, is used to illustrate this. Sublimation
   rates in a column of blowing snow are calculated using the PBSM and
   results are compared with those obtained with a modified formulation
   which incorporates a spectrum of sublimating particles of varying sizes
   at each height in a steady-state surface boundary layer and different
   specifications of the ventilation velocity.}},

Abstract = {{Snow and ice present interesting challenges to hydrologists. Simulating
   the radiative balance over snow, which is an important part of
   surface-atmosphere interactions, is particularly challenging because of
   the decay in albedo over time and the difficulty in estimating surface
   temperature and incoming long-wave radiation fluxes. Few models are
   available that include a comprehensive energy and water balance for cold
   season conditions. The simultaneous heat and water model (SHAW) is a
   detailed, physical process model of a vertical, one-dimensional
   canopy-snow-residue-soil system which integrates the detailed physics of
   heat and water transfer through a plant canopy, snow, residue and soil
   into one simultaneous solution. Detailed provisions for metamorphosis of
   the snowpack are included. The SHAW model was applied to data for one
   winter/spring season (November to May) on a ploughed field in Minnesota
   without prior calibration to test the performance of the radiation
   components. Maximum snow depth during this period was 30 cm. For the
   nearly 100 days of snowcover, the model accounted for 69\% of the
   variation in net solar radiation, 66\% of the variation in incoming
   long-wave radiation, 87\% of the variation in emitted long-wave
   radiation, 26\% of the variation in net long-wave radiation and 55\% of
   the variation in net radiation balance. Mean absolute error in simulated
   values ranged from 10 W m(-2) for emitted long-wave radiation to 27 W
   m(-2) for the entire net radiation balance. Mean bias error ranged from
   8 W m(-2) for emitted long-wave radiation to -16 W m(-2) for the entire
   net radiation balance. When the entire 170 days of simulation, which
   included periods without snowcover, were included in the analysis, the
   variation in observed values increased greatly. As a result, the
   variation in observed values accounted for by the model increased to 97,
   71, 93, 56 and 94\%, respectively, while the mean absolute and mean bias
   errors in simulated values remained nearly the same. Model modifications
   and parameter adjustments necessary to improve winter-time simulation
   were investigated. Simulation results suggest that the SHAW model may be
   a useful tool in simulating the interactive influences of radiative
   transfer at the surface-atmosphere interface.}},

Abstract = {{A study designed to test the validity of an isotopic method for
   estimating evaporation was conducted within a small, tundra lake
   situated in the continental Arctic of Canada. Evaporation was determined
   using an isotope mass balance approach which accounted quantitatively
   for isotopic fractionation, progressive evaporative enrichment of
   delta(18)O and delta(2)H in lake water, and attenuation of enrichment by
   liquid inputs and atmospheric moisture. Concurrent determinations made
   using standard mass balance, energy balance, aerodynamic profile and
   class A pans permitted rigorous comparisons between methods. Results are
   presented for two summers which had distinct weather conditions and
   hydrological balances. Overall, the delta(18)O balance was found to be
   in good agreement with standard methods during both years over time
   intervals greater than about one week. Owing to a less systematic
   response of delta(2)H over short time periods, it use is not recommended
   for quantitative mass balance determinations over time intervals of less
   than about 50 days in this setting.}},

Abstract = {{Models of surface energy balance and snow metamorphism are utilized to
   predict the energy and meltwater fluxes at an Arctic site in the
   forest-tundra transition zone of north-western Canada. The surface
   energy balance during the melt period is modelled using an hourly bulk
   aerodynamic approach. Once a snowcover becomes patchy, advection from
   the bare patches to the snow-covered areas results in a large spatial
   variation in basin snowmelt. In order to illustrate the importance of
   small-scale, horizontal advection, a simple parameterization scheme
   using sensible heat fluxes from snow free areas was tested. This scheme
   estimates the maximum horizontal advection of sensible heat from the
   bare patches to the snow-covered areas. Calculated melt was routed
   through the measured snowcover in each landscape type using a variable
   flow path, meltwater percolation model. This allowed the determination
   of the spatial variability in the timing and magnitude of meltwater
   release for runoff. Model results indicate that the initial release of
   meltwater first occurred on the shallow upland tundra sites, but
   meltwater release did not occur until nearly two weeks later on the deep
   drift snowcovers. During these early periods of melt, not all meltwater
   is available for runoff. Instead, there is a period when some snowpacks
   are only partially contributing to runoff, and the spatial variation of
   runoff contribution corresponds to landscape type. Comparisons of melt
   with and without advection suggests that advection is an important
   process controlling the timing of basin snowmelt.}},

Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{The concept of a spatially distributed unit hydrograph is based on the
   fact that the unit hydrograph can be derived from the time-area curve of
   a watershed by the S-curve method. The time-area diagram is a graph of
   cumulative drainage area contributing to discharge at the watershed
   outlet within a specified time of travel. Accurate determination of the
   time-area diagram is made possible by using a GIS. The GIS is used to
   describe the connectivity of the links in the watershed flow network and
   to calculate distances and travel times to the watershed outlet for
   various points within the watershed. Overland how travel times are
   calculated by the kinematic wave equation for time to equilibrium;
   channel flow times are based on the Manning and continuity equations. To
   account for channel storage, travel times for channel reaches are
   increased by a percentage depending on the channel reach length and
   geometry. With GIS capability for rainfall mapping, the assumption of a
   uniform spatial rainfall distribution is no longer necessary; hence the
   term, spatially distributed unit hydrograph. An example of the
   application for the Waiparous Creek in the Alberta Foothills is given.
   IDRISI is used to develop a simple digital elevation model of the 229
   km(2) watershed, using 1 km x 1 km grid cells. A grid of how directions
   is developed and used to create an equivalent channel network. Excess
   rainfall for each I km x 1 km cell is individually computed by the Soil
   Conservation Service (SCS) runoff curve method and routed through the
   equivalent channel network to obtain the time-area curve.
   The derived unit hydrograph gave excellent results in simulating an
   observed flood hydrograph. The distributed unit hydrograph is no longer
   a lumped model, since it accounts for internal distribution of rainfall
   and runoff. It is derived for a watershed without the need for observed
   rainfall and discharge data, because it is essentially a
   geomorphoclimatic approach. As such, it allows the derivation of
   watershed responses (hydrographs) to inputs of various magnitudes, thus
   eliminating the assumption of proportionality of input and output if
   needed. The superposition of outputs is retained in simulating flood
   hydrographs by convolution, since it has been shown that some non-linear
   systems satisfy the principle of superposition. The distributed unit
   hydrograph appears to be a very promising rainfall runoff model based on
   GIS technology.}},

Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1411-1426}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Repeated dye tracer tests were undertaken from individual moulins at
   Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland, over a number of diurnal discharge
   cycles during the summers of 1989-1991. It was hoped to use the concepts
   of at-a-station hydraulic geometry to infer flow conditions in
   subglacial channels from the form of the velocity-discharge
   relationships derived from these tests. The results, however, displayed
   both clockwise and anticlockwise velocity-discharge hysteresis, in
   addition to the simple power function relationship assumed in the
   hydraulic geometry approach.
   Clockwise hysteresis seems to indicate that a moulin drains into a small
   tributary channel rather than directly into an arterial channel, and
   that discharges in the two channels vary out of phase with each other.
   Anticlockwise hysteresis is accompanied by strong diurnal variations in
   the value of dispersivity derived from the dye breakthrough curve, and
   is best explained by hydraulic damming of moulins or sub/englacial
   passageways.
   Despite the complex velocity-discharge relationships observed, some
   indication of subglacial flow conditions may be obtained if tributary
   channels comprise only a small fraction of the drainage path and power
   function velocity-discharge relationships are derived from dye
   injections conducted during periods when the supraglacial discharge
   entering the moulin and the bulk discharge vary in phase. Analyses based
   on this premise suggest that both open and closed channel flow occur
   beneath Haut Glacier d'Arolla, and that flow conditions are highly
   variable at and between sites.}},

   soil water budget identified the irrigation opportunities, and a storage
   subroutine in the budget calculated the peak storage requirement in each
   year The first method used the ninth decile in the cumulative
   probability distribution of the annual peak storage requirements as a
   direct estimate of the storage capacity with a 10\% frequency of
   overloading. The other methods used the peak storage requirement in
   selected design years. These represented years with either the tenth
   smallest annual irrigation potential or the tenth largest annual
   rainfall. Methods which used design years tended to underestimate the
   storage requirements because the indices did not assess the daily
   distribution of rainfall within a month or year. Although the overload
   frequency was set at 10\%, the overload was less than 2\% of the total
   volume of effluent because overloading did not occur throughout the

Abstract = {{From 1985 to 1993, the mean summer temperature was 1.1 degrees C above
   the long-term mean and the mean winter precipitation was 11\% below the
   long-term mean at the eight Washington State Cascade Mountain weather
   stations. The effect of this climate fluctuation on glacier and alpine
   runoff has been examined in five North Cascade basins. From 1985 to 1993
   the two basins with less than 1\% glacier-covered area experienced mean
   1 July to 30 September (late summer) runoff 36\% below the long-term
   mean. The three moderately glaciated basins (3, 6 and 14\% glaciated,
   respectively) experienced a 13\% decline in late summer runoff for the
   same period. A significant change in late summer runoff has occurred in
   the North Cascades and this change is less pronounced in glacier basins.
   The cause of the change is decreased winter precipitation and earlier
   onset of spring melting of the alpine snowpack, followed by above
   average summer temperatures and an earlier summer melt of alpine
   snowpack. The smaller decrease in runoff in glacial basins is due to
   increased ablation and consequent glacier runoff due to high summer
   temperatures. However, glacier retreat is also reducing glacier runoff.}},

Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1193-1208}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted to characterize the behaviour of
   nitrate in an agricultural field during winter. The experiment embraced
   measurements of the nitrate concentration profiles at 40 plots at the
   beginning and end of the experiment. Additionally, the nitrogen inputs
   through rainfall and fertilization were assessed throughout the
   experiment. To estimate the transport properties of the soil at the 40
   plots, a bromide tracer experiment was carried out. The transport of
   this conservative tracer in the plots could be described as a convective
   dispersive process. To predict the nitrate concentration profile at the
   end of the experiment from the initial concentrations, convective
   dispersive transport was assumed along with zero-order kinetics to
   describe nitrification. On plot scale, this simple model performed
   poorly. This was attributed mainly to the spatial heterogeneity of the
   fertilizer dosage. However, when the local model was scaled up to
   describe the field-averaged behaviour of nitrate, the deviation of the
   model from the measurements was significantly smaller. From this, it can
   be concluded that in certain situations, simple models can provide
   adequate descriptions of processes which, though highly complex on the
   local scale, become accessible when averaged over larger areas.}},

Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},

Volume = {{10}},

Pages = {{1209-1227}},

Abstract = {{The diffusive wave equation is generally used in flood routing in
   rivers. The two parameters of the equation, celerity and diffusivity,
   are usually taken as functions of the discharge. If these two parameters
   can be assumed to be constant without lateral inflow, the diffusive wave
   equation may have an analytical solution: the Hayami model. A general
   analytical method, based on Hayami's hypothesis, is developed here which
   resolves the diffusive wave flood routing equation with lateral inflow
   or outflow uniformly distributed over a channel reach. Flood routing
   parameters are then identified using observed inflow and outflow and the
   Hayami model used to simulate outflow. Two examples are discussed.
   Firstly, the prediction of the hydrograph at a downstream section on the
   basis of a knowledge of the hydrograph at an upstream section and the
   lateral inflow. The second example concerns lateral inflow
   identification between an upstream and a downstream section on the basis
   of a knowledge of hydrographs at the upstream and downstream sections.
   The new general Hayami model was applied to flood routing simulation and
   for lateral inflow identification of the River Allier in France. The
   major advantages of the method relate to computer simulation, real-time
   forecasting and control applications in examples where numerical
   instabilities, in the solution of the partial differential equations
   must be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{The rainfall-runoff process consists of an excess rainfall process and a
   runoff concentration process. A transient one-dimensional finite
   difference model describing the partitioning of precipitation between
   surface runoff, soil moisture storage and deep percolation, through the
   coupling of saturated-unsaturated zones, has been implemented in a
   geographical information system including data on vegetation cover
   derived from the Landsat Thematic Mapper. The model has been used to
   simulate both the rainfall excess and the resultant outflow hydrographs
   for a small arid zone drainage basin in the Andean region of Argentina.
   The overall hydrograph shape, peak discharge, runoff volume and flow
   duration are predicted within a relative squared error of 13.2\%. The
   spatial input data and the model structure are discussed and suggestions
   for applications to larger complex basins and for future refinements in
   the technique are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Soil hydraulic functions for runoff simulation were collected in three
   catchments in a loess region of The Netherlands. To obtain these
   functions each soil horizon was sampled and water retention and
   hydraulic conductivity characteristics were determined. A simulation
   with the computer program SWMS\_2D was used to quantify runoff
   generation during standard rain events. Based on the simulation outcome,
   soil horizons were merged. This resulted in a database of 25 soil
   hydraulic functions, each representing a soil horizon or a specific
   condition of the top layer. Maps showing the soil physical composition
   of the area were constructed using these soil physical building blocks.
   The maps can be used as input for soil and water erosion models to be
   applied on the catchment scale. Comparison of potential runoff figures
   with measured data showed that the soil physical schematization appeared
   to be appropriate. The soil physical schematization in the areas studied
   was based on structural rather than on textural differences of the top
   soil.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate estimations of water retention and detention are needed to
   simulate surface runoff and soil erosion following a rainfall event in a
   catchment. Several equations to estimate the amount of surface
   depressional storage, the fraction of the soil surface covered by water
   and the amount of rainfall excess needed to start surface runoff have
   been developed by Onstad (1984). The random roughness and slope gradient
   are needed for those estimations.
   Surface micro-elevation data have been gathered by a photographic
   method. The random roughness was determined from those elevation
   measurements. Several factors which have an impact on the soil surface
   roughness were taken into account. The main sources of influence are the
   type of land use, the crop stage within the growing period and tillage
   direction. Analyses of variance indicated that the variation in the
   RR-index could be explained mainly by type of land use, orientation and
   field type. The temporal variation was relatively small.
   Gradient data have been determined from a digital elevation model,
   constructed by digitizing contours. Combining the random roughness and
   the steepness of slope, the amounts of surface water retention and
   detention could be estimated. Knowledge of water retention and detention
   will improve the estimations of runoff and soil erosion modelling in
   catchments, such as those made with the LISEM model.
   The agricultural systems examined in this study have similar random
   roughness values in summer. Different soil erosion rates for several
   types of land use can not therefore be explained by the random
   roughness.}},

Abstract = {{Over a two-year period, rainfall, runoff and sediment output were
   measured in six small agricultural catchments (3-10 ha) in south Limburg
   (The Netherlands). These measurements were needed for validation of an
   erosion model for South Limburg (LISEM). In this paper, results of the
   measurements are presented and processes that determine surface runoff
   and sediment yield during winter and summer rainfall are identified.
   Before the start of the measurement programme, surface slaking and crust
   formation on the erodible loess soils were thought to be the main cause
   of overland flow and soil erosion in South Limburg. This was the
   starting point for soil conservation measures in the area. The
   measurement results discussed in this paper show that in some catchments
   much runoff occurred in winter and that soil moisture storage capacity
   may be just as important for runoff generation as infiltration capacity.
   Therefore, when modelling soil erosion and optimizing erosion control
   measures for South Limburg, runoff generation through Hortonian as well
   as through saturation overland flow must be considered.}},

Abstract = {{For four years, runoff and soil loss from seven cropping systems of
   fodder maize have been measured on experimental plots under natural and
   simulated rainfall. Besides runoff and soil loss, several variables have
   also been measured, including rainfall kinetic energy, degree of
   slaking, surface roughness, aggregate stability, soil moisture content,
   crop cover, shear strength and topsoil porosity. These variables explain
   a large part of the variance in measured runoff, soil loss and splash
   erosion under the various cropping systems.
   The following conclusions were drawn from the erosion measurements on
   the experimental plots (these conclusions apply to the spatial level at
   which the measurements were carried out). (1) Soil tillage after maize
   harvest strongly reduced surface runoff and soil loss during the winter;
   sowing of winter rye further reduced winter erosion, though the
   difference with a merely tilled soil is small. (2) During spring and the
   growing season, soil loss is reduced strongly if the soil surface is
   partly covered by plant residues; the presence of plant residue on the
   surface appeared to be essential in achieving erosion reduction in
   summer. (3) Soil loss reductions were much higher than runoff
   reductions; significant runoff reduction is only achieved by the `straw
   system' having flat-lying, non-fixed plant residue on the soil surface;
   the other systems, though effective in reducing soil loss, were not
   effective in reducing runoff.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper discusses aspects of grass vegetation in relation to soil
   erosion control. By means of a literature research, four options for
   using grass vegetation were recognized, each having its own requirements
   concerning maintenance, vegetation characteristics and field layout. The
   main filter mechanisms, application in the field and effects on runoff
   and soil loss are discussed. Field experiments on filter strips were
   carried out to determine whether literature data for water and sediment
   retention by vegetation can be applied to sloping loess soils in South
   Limburg (The Netherlands). The field experiments simulated a situation
   in which surface runoff carrying loess sediment from an upslope field
   enters a grass strip. The retention of water and sediment by grass
   strips was determined by measuring runoff discharge and the sediment
   concentration at the inflow and outflow points from bordered plots. Two
   locations with different grass age and agricultural management were
   studied.
   Results show that grass strips are effective in filtering sediment from
   surface runoff as long as concentrated flow is absent. Outflow sediment
   concentrations could be described as a function of inflow concentrations
   and strip width. Reductions of sediment discharge varied between 50-60,
   60-90 and 90-99\% for strips of 1, 4-5 and 10 m width, respectively. Old
   grass, extensively used as pasture, is more effective in reducing
   erosion than the younger grass which was often accessed by tractors for
   mowing. Differences in water retention between both grass locations
   appear to be caused mainly by differences in grass density.}},

Abstract = {{Surface runoff may be generated when the rainfall intensity exceeds the

   Indications exist that both types of overland flow may occur in hilly
   agricultural loess regions. Here, for a loessial hillslope under maize
   in the southern part of The Netherlands, it was shown, with pressure
   head and runoff measurements, that Hortonian overland flow occurs during
   typical summer rain events. Surface runoff was initiated after
   saturation of the top 5-10 cm of the soil. Deeper in the soil,
   unsaturated conditions prevailed while runoff took place. Peak runoff
   discharges at the outlet of the subcatchment occurred a few minutes
   after peak rainfall intensities were measured. It appeared that
   SWMS\_2D, a two-dimensional water how model, was capable in simulating
   observed pressure head changes and runoff. Simulated potential runoff
   for the transect studied was higher by a magnitude of three than the
   measured areal average. This indicates effects of surface pending, and
   the probable location of this particular transect in a region with high
   runoff production.}},

Abstract = {{On four hillslopes in the loess region of The Netherlands pressure heads
   were monitored using stand alone measuring devices. During rain events
   pressure heads were measured regularly with lime intervals of five
   minutes. Rainfall was recorded with a tipping bucket rainfall gauge.
   Two-dimensional simulations were executed to simulate water flow through
   these hillslopes during erosive rain events in summer and winter
   periods. From these simulations it appeared that vertical flow is
   dominant during rain events, and that lateral water transport is of
   minor importance despite distinct layer stratifications. During the
   selected rain showers, average lateral water movement varied between 1.6
   and 4.7\% of the total water displacement through the hillslopes.
   Therefore, it was decided to incorporate a one-dimensional water flow
   module into the event-based distributed soil erosion and hydrological
   model LISEM.}},

Abstract = {{A new physically based hydrological and soil erosion model has been
   developed, which can be used for planning and conservation purposes: the
   LImburg Soil Erosion Model (LISEM). The LISEM model is one of the first
   examples of a physically based model that is completely incorporated in
   a raster Geographical Information System. This incorporation facilitates
   easy application in larger catchments, improves the user friendliness by
   avoiding conversion routines and allows remotely sensed data to be used.
   Processes incorporated in the model are rainfall, interception, surface
   storage in micro-depressions, infiltration and vertical movement of
   water in the soil, overland flow, channel flow, detachment by rainfall
   and throughfall, detachment by overland flow and transport capacity of
   the flow. Special attention has been given to the influence of tractor
   wheelings, small roads and surface sealing. Vertical movement of water
   in the soil is simulated using the Richard's equation. Optionally, the
   user can choose the Holtan or the Green-Ampt infiltration model. For the
   distribution flow routing, a four-point finite-difference solution of
   the kinematic wave is used together with Manning's equation.}},

   LISEM, the Limburg soil erosion model. The model uses physically based
   equations to describe interception, infiltration and soil water

   results it is clear that, although the model has several advantages over
   other models, the results of LISEM 1.0 are far from perfect. Based on
   the sensitivity analysis and held observations, the main reasons for
   these differences seems to be the spatial and temporal variability of
   the soil hydraulic conductivity and the initial pressure head at the
   basin scale. Another reason for the differences between measured and

Abstract = {{Wetlands in regional discharge areas of the Red River Valley of eastern
   North Dakota provide runoff, flood protection and wildlife habitat. Two
   years of groundwater and soil water monitoring were used to characterize
   the hydrology of a 500 ha wetland 24 km north-west of Grand Forks. The
   objective was to describe, monitor and model important water budget
   processes. From November through March 1990 and 1991, the water-table
   dropped as water flowed towards frost in the vadose zone. Where
   saturated soils occurred near the surface, the water-table rose quickly
   in the spring. A later, larger rise occurred where the water-table and
   capillary fringe were deeper. During the summer, precipitation was
   rapidly depleted by evapotranspiration (ET). The low hydraulic
   conductivity of the clayey lacustrine sediments (0.1-2 m/yr) combined
   with a small horizontal hydraulic gradient results in minimal lateral
   and maximum vertical flow. The US Geological Survey MODFLOW code was
   used to simulate vertical saturated flow. By including actual ET
   (estimated from potential evaporation) and using the recharge option to
   represent vadose flow, the model provided good correspondence between
   observed and simulated hydrographs. These results suggest that a shallow
   vertical flow of ground and soil water dominates the hydrological
   budget. Simulation of unusually dry conditions, such as those
   experienced during the 1930s, indicates that water levels in the wetland
   would reach a steady-state about 0.3 m lower than normal within two to
   three years. Less winter vadose storage would decrease the water-level
   rise in spring and early summer, but would have a minimal impact on the
   overall yearly water budget.}},

Abstract = {{Residence times and flow paths of pipe and stream flow were studied
   during low flow in the Nant Gerig and Gwy experimental catchments at
   Plynlimon in mid-Wales, UK, using a two-month time series of natural
   deuterium and electrical conductivity data from perennial and ephemeral
   pipe flow, stream flow, groundwater and rainfall. Low flow in both the
   perennial pipe and the stream was maintained by `old' groundwater
   discharge. This groundwater was at least 40 days old. Flow in the
   ephemeral pipe was dominated by old groundwater and was only slightly
   affected by direct inputs of new water. Although direct rainfall inputs
   contributed minimally to runoff in the perennial pipe and the stream,
   rainfall influenced the isotopic and chemical character of the
   groundwater, Rainfall also affected the water-table elevation, which
   determined the flashiness of the perennial pipe flow and whether the
   ephemeral pipe flowed. The isotope and electrical conductivity data
   suggest that storm runoff in both the main pipe and the stream is
   overwhelmingly old water. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the old
   water is supplied both from near-stream groundwater and upslope
   groundwater delivered by the ephemeral pipes.}},

Abstract = {{Four experiments were performed to examine the relationship between the
   meltwater flow field and ion release from melting snow. A 0.4 m(3)
   volume of snow was placed in a Plexiglass box and melted from above
   using a heating plate. The meltwater and solute fluxes issuing from the
   bottom of the snow were monitored. In experiments with NaCl tracer added
   to the snow, the solute concentrations were generally lower in the flow
   fingers than in the background wetting front. Dye tracer experiments
   revealed contemporaneous areas of concentrated dye and dilute meltwater
   in flow fingers. This suggests that the meltwater in flow fingers is
   diluted by low concentration water from the top of the snowpack. Flow
   fingers contribute more meltwater flux primarily because the flow is
   maintained for a longer period of time than in the non-finger areas;
   however, the relative contribution of flow fingers to solute flux was
   apparently not as great as that of the background wetting front because
   of dilution of solute in the flow finger areas.}},

Abstract = {{The contribution from agricultural catchments to stream nitrogen and
   phosphorus concentrations was assessed by evaluation of the chemical
   composition of these nutrients in agricultural runoff for both surface
   and subsurface flow pathways. A range of land uses (grazed and ungrazed
   grassland, cereals, roots) in intensive agricultural systems was studied
   at scales from hillslope plots (0.5 m(2)) to large catchment (>300
   km(2)). By fractionating the total nutrient load it was possible to
   establish that most of the phosphorus was transported in the unreactive
   (particulate and organic) fraction via surface runoff. This was true
   regardless of the scale of measurement. The form of the nitrogen load
   varied with land use and grazing intensity. High loads of dissolved
   inorganic nitrogen (with >90\% transported as NH4-N) were recorded in
   surface runoff from heavily grazed land. In subsurface flow from small
   (2 km(2)) subcatchments and in larger (>300 km(2)) catchments, organic
   nitrogen was found to be an important secondary constituent of the total
   nitrogen load, comprising 40\% of the total annual load.}},

Abstract = {{The results are presented of an intensive monitoring programme to
   determine eroded volumes due to observed rainfall events on a hillslope
   surface. The surface investigated has been reproduced through a digital
   elevation model and analysed in terms of drainage network, contributing
   area and slope by performing planimetric and altimetric analysis.
   Erosion maps were derived from a comparison of consecutive digital
   elevation models relative to time. These maps reveal the spatial and
   temporal evolution of the erosion process at the hillslope scale. The
   erosion was uniform across the surface, supporting the assumption of
   randomness in the erosion process commonly used in surface drainage
   development models. The observed value of erosion has been estimated at
   approximately 0.11 m/m(2) per year, with almost 500 mm of total annual
   rainfall.}},

Abstract = {{In an isolated storm event model relating gross rainfall to the flow
   hydrograph, the shape transformation component can be composed of a
   number of subsystems. It is assumed here that this component contains,
   along with other subsystems, a non-linear conceptual reservoir expressed
   in general terms. Given an isolated storm event, a procedure is
   described that directly identifies the particular inflow sequence that
   needs to be applied to this reservoir to reproduce the observed
   discharge hydrograph as outflow. This procedure makes use of information
   contained only in the observed hydrograph and does not rely on prior
   knowledge of the gross or net rainfall hyetographs. Nor is it necessary
   to identify in full the storage-outflow relation of the non-linear
   reservoir used. Future comparisons between the gross rainfall hyetograph
   and the identified flow sequence should be facilitated by the
   procedure's ability to remove the long trailing recession belonging to
   the outflow.}},

Abstract = {{Rainfall-runoff modelling uncertainty can be analysed by the use of a
   stochastic integral formulation. The stochastic integral equation can be
   based on the rainfall-runoff model input of model rainfall or model
   rainfall excess. Similarly, the stochastic integral equation can be
   based on the rainfall-runoff model output of the modelled runoff
   hydrograph. The residual between actual measured runoff data and
   modelled runoff (from the rainfall-runoff model) is analysed here by the
   use of a stochastic integral equation. This approach is used to develop
   a set of convolution integral transfer function realizations that
   represent the chosen rainfall-runoff modelling error. The resulting
   stochastic integral component is a distribution of possible residual
   outcomes that may be directly added to the rainfall-runoff model's
   deterministic outcome, to develop a distribution of probable runoff
   hydrograph realizations from the chosen rainfall-runoff model.}},

Abstract = {{It is demonstrated that a unitgraph can be obtained without using
   rainfall data, provided data from at least two runoff events are
   available. A numerical method has been devised which calculates this
   common unitgraph for a set of surface runoff events and at the same time
   determines the input (rainfall excess) for each event. The method has
   been successfully tested on catchments ranging in size from 0.4 to 600
   km(2); it requires streamflow observations taken at intervals which
   retain all significant frequencies in the runoff hydrographs. The method
   also requires application of a baseflow separation procedure which is
   consistent for all events. The new approach has the potential to lead to
   more objective studies of the effects of catchment changes on the
   unitgraph and provides scope for comparisons of the common unitgraphs
   with geomorphological instantaneous unitgraphs.}},

Abstract = {{Common unitgraphs obtained from streamflow data for a set of runoff
   events have higher peaks, shorter times to peak and generally shorter
   total durations than average unitgraphs obtained by conventional
   techniques from rainfall and streamflow data for single events. The
   calculated inputs to these unitgraphs lag behind the corresponding peaks
   in the catchment rainfall and continue after the end of rainfall. It
   eventuates that these inputs are best modelled by including a strongly
   non-linear storage in the rainfall loss model. For common loss and
   storage parameters, runoff hydrographs from the overall model fit the
   observed hydrographs over a wider range of flows than predictions from
   application of conventional unitgraph methods. The new approach can be
   interpreted physically as a non-linear process of rainfall loss and
   routing to stream channels, followed by linear routing of stream flow;
   or functionally as a separation of the common linear elements in the
   overall rainfall-runoff process from the loss and non-linear elements.
   It has the potential to lead to improved predictions of storm runoff

Abstract = {{Current models of solute movement in catchments are based on
   rainfall-runoff models and are consequently biased towards processes
   which determine the magnitude and timing of water flux. It is shown here
   that the instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH), or runoff response
   function, obtained from a hydrograph is fundamentally different from the
   residence time distribution which governs the response to
   solutes/tracers. Using hydrometric and tracer data obtained from a small
   (25 ha) catchment in the humid tropics a modification of the IUH
   technique is demonstrated which also allows approximate modelling of the
   tracer data. New features of the modified conceptual model are
   identified with known hillslope processes.}},

Abstract = {{A unit hydrograph model is proposed in which the watershed is decomposed
   into subareas which are individual cells or zones of neighbouring cells.
   The unit hydrograph is found for each subarea and the response at the
   outlet to excess rainfall on each subarea is summed to produce the
   watershed runoff hydrograph. The cell to cell flow path to the watershed
   outlet is determined from a digital elevation model. A constant flow
   velocity is assigned to each cell and the time lag between subarea input
   and response at the watershed outlet is found by integrating the flow
   time along the path from the subarea to the outlet. The response
   function for a subarea is modelled as a lagged linear reservoir in which
   the flow time is equal to the sum of a time of translation and an
   average residence time in the reservoir. It is shown that the assumption
   of a spatially varying, but time-invariant, velocity held underlying
   this model produces a linear system model for all subareas whose outputs
   can be summed in the manner indicated. An example application is
   presented for the 8.70 km(2) Severn watershed at Plynlimon in Wales
   using a 50 m digital elevation model in which the cell velocity is
   calculated by modifying an average watershed velocity according to the
   terrain slope and the drainage area of each cell. The resulting model
   reasonably reproduces the observed unit hydrograph.}},

Abstract = {{The storm response of a catchment can be considered to consist of two
   components; the hillslope response and the stream network response. The
   first of these is examined here. Simple analytical models of overland
   flow and subsurface stormflow are presented which are applicable for use
   in catchment-scale models of the rainfall-runoff response. The hillslope
   models are meant to describe the collective responses of the hillslopes
   in a catchment in a simple way that is also physically meaningful. The
   overland flow model is based on a generalization of classic work by
   Horton and of more recent work by Rose et al. known as Rose's
   approximation. The subsurface flow model consists of two components. The
   piston displacement model is used to describe flow in the unsaturated
   zone between the soil surface and the perched water-table. The kinematic
   assumption combined with Rose's approximation is used to describe flow
   in the saturated zone. These hillslope models are then used to derive
   instantaneous response functions for both overland flow and subsurface
   stormflow, under different rainfall intensities and antecedent flow
   conditions.}},

Title = {{Modelling rainfall-runoff from large catchment to basin scale: The

Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{A lumped parameter dynamic rainfall-runoff model, IHACRES, is applied to
   the large upland area (more than 4500 km(2)) of the Goulburn Valley
   Basin, Victoria, Australia to predict streamflow under different
   climatic conditions. This paper presents the first evaluation of a
   rainfall-runoff model at large catchment scale, which is comprehensive
   in terms of the number of catchments investigated and the number of
   calibration and simulation periods used. The basin is subdivided into 12
   catchments (from 100 to 700 km(2)), each of which is calibrated
   separately. High values of model efficiency and low bias are
   consistently obtained for different calibration sub-periods for all
   catchments in the basin. Simulation or so-called validation tests are
   used to select the best models for each catchment. This allows
   simulation of the water regime during long historical (approximately 90
   year) periods when only climatological (rainfall and temperature) data
   were available. This procedure is extremely important for the estimation
   of the effect of climate variability and of the possible impact of
   climate change on the hydrological regime in the region and, in
   particular, for supporting irrigation management of the basin.
   Analysis of a composite catchment (2417 km(2)) and its five separate
   subcatchments indicates that the information content in the
   rainfall-streamflow data is independent of catchment size. Dynamic
   modelling of the daily water balance at the macroscale is limited
   principally by the adequacy of the precipitation gauging network. When a
   good estimate of areal precipitation is available for a catchment, it is
   not necessary to consider subcatchment-scale variability for modelling
   if the only interest is the daily discharge and evaporation losses from
   the catchment.}},

Abstract = {{Sixteen small catchments in the Maroondah region of Victoria, Australia
   were analysed using rainfall, temperature and streamflow time series
   with a rainfall-runoff model whose parameters efficiently characterize
   the hydrological response of a catchment. A set of catchment attributes
   for each of these catchments was then compared with the associated set
   of hydrological response characteristics of the catchments as estimated
   by the model. The time constant governing quickflow recession of
   streamflow (tau(q)) was related to the drainage network and catchment
   area. The time constant governing slowflow recession of streamflow
   (tau(s)) was related to the slope and shape of the catchment. The
   parameter governing evapotranspirative losses (f) was related to
   catchment gradient and vegetative water use. Forestry activities in the
   catchments changed evapotranspirative losses and thus total volume of
   streamflow, but did not affect the rate of streamflow recession.}},

Abstract = {{The convolution assumption between excess rainfall and runoff provides a
   framework in which catchment runoff can be predicted with reasonable
   accuracy and moderate computational cost. Associated with it, the
   deconvolution problem of estimating unitgraph ordinates from
   rainfall-runoff events involves a matrix with a particularly simple
   structure. This matrix structure is used here as a basis on which the
   ill-posed nature of deconvolution is analysed. As a result, based on a
   simple transform of the excess rainfall data, a very simple criterion is
   derived to test the degree to which deconvolution may yield a unit
   hydrograph estimate displaying spurious oscillations of large magnitude.
   This has practical implications as the solution to an ill-posed problem
   can be very sensitive to errors in the model and the data and therefore
   may need to be stabilized. Illustration of these issues is provided
   using published rainfall-runoff data.}},

   soil behaviour}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainties in major input variables in water and solute models were
   quantified and their effects on simulated functional aspects of soil
   behaviour were studied using basic soil properties from an important
   soil mapping unit in the Netherlands. The major sources of uncertainty
   were: (i) spatial variability of basic soil properties such as soil
   profile composition and soil texture combined with spatial variability
   in water-table depths; and (ii) uncertainty associated with the use of
   pedotransfer functions to predict soil hydraulic functions. The two
   different sources of uncertainty were quantified and their respective
   contributions to the explanation of variability in modelling results
   were statistically evaluated by an analysis of variance. Additionally,
   regression analysis was used to evaluate the role of spatial variability
   in water-table depths only. It appeared that uncertainty of pedotransfer
   functions was an important factor when simulating the functional aspects
   of soil behaviour `days with a good workability' and `days with
   sufficient aeration'. The combination of variability of basic soil
   properties and of water-table depths dominated when simulating the
   functional aspects `breakthrough characteristics of chloride and of the
   adsorbing chemicals cadmium and Isoproturon'. With the exception of the
   simulated functional aspect `days until 10\% chloride breakthrough', the
   uncertainty in the other simulated functional aspects was largely
   explained by spatial variability in the evolution of water-table depths.
   Sampling should therefore mainly aim at adequately describing the
   variability of basic soil properties including water-table depths if
   leaching of chemicals is studied, but should also aim at an adequate
   description of soil hydraulic functions using pedotransfer functions
   when functional aspects of soil behaviour of a physical nature are
   studied.}},

Abstract = {{The throughfall in dry evergreen forest and mixed forest in central
   Guyana (South America) was measured over a period of 17 months using
   both a moving and a fixed stratified random sampling scheme. The
   throughfall, stemflow and canopy cover fractions of the two forest types
   were not significantly different. The data set was used to test the
   canopy water balance model designed by Rutter et al. (1971). Compared
   with both forest types, the model underestimated the total interception
   fraction: 13 . 4\% for the Rutter model as opposed to 17 . 3 and 16 .
   0\% of the rainfall for dry evergreen forest and mixed forest. This was
   caused by a severe underestimation of interception on days with a
   rainfall of more than approximately 10 mm. Compared with the rainfall
   frequency distribution of the area, accurate model results were obtained
   for 20\% of the rainfall only. Sensitivity analysis shows that an
   increase of saturation storage capacity or potential evaporation by
   150\% will give an acceptable accumulated interception, but that this is
   caused by large overestimation on days with a low amount of rainfall.
   The Rutter model was extended with a layered representation of the
   canopy, with simulation of the microclimate, but using basically the
   same input data. This resulted in a higher total interception fraction
   (16 . 3\% of the rainfall), especially in the range 5-20 mm/day, because
   of a larger storage at the start of each rainstorm and an increased
   surface available for evaporation.}},

Abstract = {{Infiltration data were collected on two rectangular grids with 25
   sampling points each. Both experimental grids were located in tropical
   rain forest (Guyana), the first in an Arenosol area and the second in a
   Ferralsol field. Four different infiltration models were evaluated based
   on their performance in describing the infiltration data. The model
   parameters were estimated using non-linear optimization techniques. The
   infiltration behaviour in the Ferralsol was equally well described by
   the equations of Philip, Green-Ampt, Kostiakov and Horton. For the
   Arenosol, the equations of Philip, Green-Ampt and Horton were
   significantly better than the Kostiakov model. Basic soil properties
   such as textural composition (percentage sand, silt and clay), organic
   carbon content, dry bulk density, porosity, initial soil water content
   and root content were also determined for each sampling point of the two
   grids. The fitted infiltration parameters were then estimated based on
   other soil properties using multiple regression. Prior to the regression
   analysis, all predictor variables were transformed to normality. The
   regression analysis was performed using two information levels. The
   first information level contained only three texture fractions for the
   Ferralsol (sand, silt and clay) and four fractions for the Arenosol
   (coarse, medium and fine sand, and silt and clay). At the first
   information level the regression models explained up to 60\% of the
   variability of some of the infiltration parameters for the Ferralsol
   held plot. At the second information level the complete textural
   analysis was used (nine fractions for the Ferralsol and six for the
   Arenosol). At the second information level a principal components
   analysis (PCA) was performed prior to the regression analysis to
   overcome the problem of multicollinearity among the predictor variables.
   Regression analysis was then carried out using the orthogonally
   transformed soil properties as the independent variables. Results for
   the Ferralsol data show that the parameters of the Green-Ampt and
   Kostiakov model were estimated relatively accurately (maximum R(2) = 0 .
   76). For the Arenosol, use of the second information level together with
   PCA produced regression models with an R(2) value ranging from 0 . 38 to
   0 . 68. For the Ferralsol, most of the variance was explained by the
   root content and organic matter content. In the Arenosol plot, the
   fractions medium and fine sand explained most of the observed variance.}},

Abstract = {{There is a critical lack of knowledge regarding the dynamics of
   streamflow generation in the semi-arid tropics, particularly in Africa.
   In this project runoff mechanisms in forested and non-forested degraded
   catchments in northern Tanzania were studied using combined
   hydrometrical and hydrochemical methods. Following the hydrochemical
   identification of several flowpaths contributing to runoff, hydrograph
   separation by an end-member model based on K and Ca was undertaken.
   Results from the forested catchment indicate that stormflow was
   dominated by event water (about 75\%), via overland flow and
   throughflow. The proportion of pre-event water (groundwater) displaced
   into the stream by a suggested riparian groundwater ridge mechanism
   varied, depending on the rainfall characteristics. In the non-forested,
   degraded catchment, nearly all stormflow was event water, and
   groundwater discharge was unaffected by rainfall. It is suggested that
   macropore flow is pivotal to the transmission of rainfall to runoff via
   throughflow, particularly in semi-arid tropical areas.}},

Abstract = {{Combining a six-term heat balance equation and a seasonal thermocline
   model, a new equation to calculate non-radiative fluxes of Lake Banyoles
   has been determined. Mean daily measurements of global solar radiation,
   downward longwave radiation, wind speed, air temperature and water
   surface temperature were used as input data and lake temperature as the
   calculated output data of the model. To calibrate performance of the new
   equation, calculated lake temperature was compared with measured lake
   temperature during both the mixing and the stratified period of the
   lake. The new coefficients in the wind function to calculate the
   non-radiative fluxes at the water surface were assumed to depend on the
   variability of the wind speed, the air temperature of the study area and
   the surface temperature of the lake. In addition, the results were used
   to estimate the heat balance of the air-water interface of Lake Banyoles
   over a period of two years. The processes that have been taken into
   account are shortwave and longwave radiation, back-radiation emitted by
   the lake, sensible and latent heat and throughflow.}},

Abstract = {{Surface water draining granitic bedrock in Yosemite National Park
   exhibits considerable variability in chemical composition, despite the
   relative homogeneity of bedrock chemistry. Other geological factors,
   including the jointing and distribution of glacial till, appear to exert
   strong controls on water composition.
   Chemical data from three surface water surveys in the upper Merced River
   basin conducted in August 1981, June 1988 and August 1991 were analysed
   and compared with mapped geological, hydrological and topographic
   features to identify the solute sources and processes that control water
   chemistry within the basin during baseflow.
   Water at most of the sampling sites was dilute, with alkalinities
   ranging from 26 to 77 mu equiv. l(-1). Alkalinity was much higher in two
   subcatchments, however, ranging from 51 to 302 mu equiv. l(-1). Base
   cations and silica were also significantly higher in these two
   catchments than in the rest of the watershed. Concentrations of
   weathering products in surface water were correlated to the fraction of
   each subcatchment underlain by surficial material, which is mostly
   glacial till. Silicate mineral weathering is the dominant control on
   concentrations of alkalinity, silica and base cations, and ratios of
   these constituents in surface water reflect the composition of local
   bedrock.
   Chloride concentrations in surface water samples varied widely, ranging
   from < 1 to 96 mu equiv. l(-1). The annual volume-weighted mean chloride
   concentration in the Merced River at the Happy Isles gauge from 1968 to
   1990 was 26 mu equiv. l(-1), which was five times higher than in
   atmospheric deposition (4-5 mu equiv, l(-1)), suggesting that a source
   of chloride exists within the watershed. Saline groundwater springs,
   whose locations are probably controlled by vertical jointing in the
   bedrock, are the most likely source of the chloride.
   Sulphate concentrations varied much less than most other solutes,
   ranging from 3 to 14 mu equiv. l(-1). Concentrations of sulphate in
   quarterly samples collected at the watershed outlet also showed
   relatively little variation, suggesting that sulphate may be regulated
   to some extent by a within-watershed process, such as sulphate
   adsorption.}},

Abstract = {{Only comparatively few experimental studies have been carried out to
   investigate the performance of the HEC-6 river morphological model. The
   model was developed by the Hydrologic Engineering Center of the US Army
   Corps of Engineers. In this study, experiments were carried out in a 20m
   long concrete flume 0 . 6m wide with varying rectangular cross-sections.
   The channel bed is paved with uniform sand of D-50 = 0 . 9 mm and D-90 =
   1 . 2mm within the test reach of 12m. Two types of experiments were
   carried out with sediment transport, one under steady uniform flow and
   another under steady non-uniform flow conditions. Nine steady uniform
   flow experiments were carried out to compare the measured equilibrium
   relationship of dow and sediment transport rate with two bedload
   formulae, namely, Du Boys and Meyer-Peter and Muller, and with three
   total load formulae, namely, Toffaleti, Laursen and Yang. It was found
   that even though the sediment transport consists of a certain portion of
   bedload, the total load formulae give satisfactory results and better
   agreement than the two bedload formulae. Five steady non-uniform flow
   experiments were carried out under various conditions of varying bed
   profile and channel width and also with sediment addition and
   withdrawal. The measured transient water surface and bed pro files are
   compared with the computed results from the HEC-6 model. It was found
   that the Toffaleti and Yang total load formulae used in the HEC-6 model
   give the most satisfactory prediction of actual bed profiles under
   various conditions of non-uniform flow and sediment transport. The
   effects of Manning's n, variations of sediment inflow, various sediment
   transport formulae, sediment grain size and the model numerical
   parameters, i.e. distance interval Delta x and numerical weighting
   factor, on the computed water surface and bed profiles were determined.
   It was found that the selection of the sediment transport formulae has
   the most significant effect on the computed results. It can be concluded
   that the HEC-6 model can predict satisfactorily a long-term average
   pattern of local scour and deposition along a channel with either a
   small abrupt change in geometry or gradually varying cross-sections.
   However, the accuracy of the model prediction is reduced in the regions
   where highly non-uniform flow occurs.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical solution for the optimum design of furrow irrigation
   systems is derived. The non-linear calculus optimization method is used
   to formulate a general form for designing the optimum system elements
   under circumstances of maximizing the water application efficiency of
   the system during irrigation. Different system bases and constraints are
   considered in the solution. A full irrigation water depth is considered
   to be achieved at the tail of the furrow line. The solution is based on
   neglecting the recession and depletion times after off-irrigation. This
   assumption is valid in the case of open-end (free gradient) furrow
   systems rather than closed-end (closed dike) systems. Illustrative
   examples for different systems are presented and the results are
   compared with the output obtained using an iterative numerical solution
   method. The final derived solution is expressed as a function of the
   furrow length ratio (the furrow length to the water travelling
   distance). The function of water travelling developed by Reddy et al. is
   considered for reaching the optimum solution. As practical results from
   the study, the optimum furrow elements for free gradient systems can be
   estimated to achieve the maximum application efficiency, i.e. furrow
   length, water inflow rate and cutoff irrigation time.}},

Abstract = {{The results are summarized of an integrated investigation of glacier
   geometry, ablation patterns, water balance, meltwater routing,
   hydrochemistry and suspended sediment yield. The ultimate objective is
   to evaluate the assumptions of lumped, two-component mixing models as
   descriptors of glacier hydrology, and to develop a semi-distributed
   physically based model as an alternative, The results of the study
   demonstrate that a reconstruction of probable subglacial drainage
   alignments can be achieved through a combination of terrain modelling
   based on estimated potential surface and dye tracing experiments.
   Recession curve analysis, evidence of the seasonal instability of the
   englacial and subglacial electrical conductivities assumed in a mixing
   model, evidence of the non-conservative behaviour of water chemistry in
   the presence of suspended sediment, and evidence of the seasonal
   evolution of the subglacial drainage system based on dye tracing all
   indicate that an alternative to a lumped, static model of the hydrology
   is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Near-surface processes on glaciers, including water flow over bare ice
   and through seasonal snow and firn, have a significant effect on the
   speed, volume and chemistry of water flow through the glacier. The
   transient nature of the seasonal snow profoundly affects the water
   discharge and chemistry. Water flow through snow is fairly slow compared
   with flow over bare ice and a thinning snowpack on a glacier decreases
   the delay between peak meltwater input and peak stream discharge.
   Furthermore, early spring melt flushes the snowpack of solutes and by
   mid-summer the melt water flowing into the glacier is fairly clean by
   comparison. The firn, a relatively constant feature of glaciers,
   attenuates variations in water drainage into the glacier by temporarily
   storing water in saturated layer. Bare ice exerts opposite influences by
   accentuating variations in runoff by water flowing over the ice surface.
   The melt of firn and ice contributes relatively clean (solute-free)
   water to the glacier water system.}},

Abstract = {{The significance of the baseflow component of glacier river discharge in
   summer varies with geographical location, altitude, glacier geometry and
   glacier size. Baseflow is maintained by meltwater generated above the
   transient equilibrium line and by water released from temporary storage
   on, in or beneath the glacier. At the Norwegian glacier Austre
   Okstindbreen, where precipitation is generally high throughout the year
   and the summers are cool and wet, observations in three successive, but
   contrasting, years have shown that Na+ ion concentrations in the glacier
   river water are influenced strongly by the amount of snowmelt. This
   itself depends on the preceding winter conditions, which determine the
   amount of accumulation, and on the current summer's weather. The
   efficiency of the glacier's drainage systems depends on the general
   progress of summer ablation. The speed with which the systems develop
   influences ion provision from subglacial sources. Ca2+ ion
   concentrations are largely determined by subglacial conditions. Oxygen
   isotope variations in glacier river water reflect the relative
   contributions made to total discharge by snow meltwater and other
   sources; the composition of the snow cover, which is a function of
   winter temperatures, has a strong influence. Ice meltwater has low
   isotopic variability, but the isotopic composition of rainfall varies
   markedly. A simple model of mixing of englacial and subglacial waters,
   each of a constant composition, cannot be applied to a high-latitude
   glacier of the size and altitudinal range of Austre Okstindbreen.}},

Abstract = {{The anion compositions (SO42-, HCO3- and Cl-) of runoff from the Haut
   Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland and Austre Broggerbreen, Svalbard are
   compared to assess whether or not variations in water chemistry with
   discharge are consistent with current understanding of the subglacial
   drainage structure of warm- and polythermal-based glaciers. These
   glacial catchments have very different bedrocks and the subglacial
   drainage structures are also believed to be different, yet the range of
   anion concentrations show considerable overlap for SO42- and HCO3-.
   Concentrations of Cl- are higher at Austre Broggerbreen because of the
   maritime location of the glacier. Correcting SO42- for the snowpack
   component reveals that the variation in non-snowpack SO42- with
   discharge and with HCO3- is similar to that observed at the Haut Glacier
   d'Arolla. Hence, if we assume that the provenance of the non-snowpack
   SO42- is the same in both glacial drainage systems, a distributed
   drainage system also contributes to runoff at Austre Broggerbreen. We
   have no independent means of testing the assumption at present. The
   lower concentrations of non-snowpack SO42- at Austre Broggerbreen may
   suggest that a smaller proportion of runoff originates from a
   distributed drainage system than at the Haut Glacier d'Arolla.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of subglacial geothermal activity on the hydrochemistry of
   the Jakulsa a Solheimasandi glacial meltwater river, south Iceland, is
   discussed. A radio echosounding and Global Positioning System survey of
   south-west Myrdalsjokull, the parent ice-cap of the valley glacier
   Solheimajokull, establishes the geometry and position of a subglacial
   caldera. A cauldron in the ice-cap surface at the basin head is also
   defined, signifying one location of geothermally driven ablation
   processes. Background H2S concentrations for the Jakulsa meltwaters in
   summer 1989 show that leakage of geothermal fluids into the glacial
   drainage network takes place throughout the melt season. Chemical
   geothermometry (Na+/K+ ratio) applied to the bulk meltwaters tentatively
   suggests that the subglacial geothermal area is a high-temperature field
   with a reservoir temperature of approximate to 289-304 degrees C. A
   major event of enhanced geothermal fluid injection was also detected.
   Against a background of an apparently warming geothermal reservoir, the
   event began on Julian day 205 (24 July) with a burst of subglacial
   seismic activity. Meltwater hydrochemical perturbations followed on day
   209 and peaked on day 213, finally leading to a sudden and significant
   increase in flow on day 214. The hydrochemical excursions were
   characterized by strong peaks in meltwater H2S, SO42- and total
   carbonate concentrations, transient decreases in pH, small increases in
   Ca2+ and Mg2+ and sustained increases in electrical conductivity. The
   event may relate to temporary invigoration of the subglacial convective
   hydrothermal circulation, seismic disturbance of patterns of groundwater
   flow and geothermal fluid recruitment to the subglacial drainage
   network, or a cycle `sweeping out' of the geothermal zone by the annual
   wave of descending groundwater, Time lags between seismic events and
   meltwater electrical conductivity responses suggest mean and maximum
   intraglacial throughflow velocities of 0.032-0.132 m s(-1),
   respectively, consistent with a distributed drainage system beneath
   Solheimajokull. Because increases in flow follow hydrochemical
   perturbations, the potential exists to use meltwater hydrochemistry to
   forecast geothermally driven flood events in such environments.}},

Abstract = {{The magnitude and processes of solute acquisition by dilute meltwater in
   contact with suspended sediment in the channelized component of the
   hydroglacial system have been investigated through a suite of controlled
   laboratory experiments. Constrained by field data from Haut Glacier
   d'Arolla, Valais, Switzerland the effects of the water to rock ratio,
   particle size, crushing, repeated wetting and the availability of
   protons on the rate of solute acquisition are demonstrated. These
   `free-drift' experiments suggest that the rock flour is extremely
   geochemically reactive and that dilute quickflow waters are certain to
   acquire solute from suspended sediment. These data have important
   implications for hydrological interpretations based on the solute
   content of glacial meltwater, mixing model calculations, geochemical
   denudation rates and solute provenance studies.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1988 and 1992 closely spaced arrays of boreholes were drilled at
   Small River Glacier, British Columbia. The borehole arrays have been
   used to investigate the interannual and spatial consistency of patterns
   of basal hydraulics beneath the glacier. A simple robust classification
   was devised identifying unconnected, high standing, low standing and dry
   base water levels in boreholes. Spatial and interannual comparisons were
   made using a simple nearest neighbour statistic, corrected for
   differences in frequency of different borehole types and evaluated using
   Monte Carlo confidence intervals to compensate for array form. Arrays in
   the lower ablation zone showed spatial and interannual coherence, with
   three distinct areas characterized by low water pressure,
   till-associated non-connection and high pressure. There was no
   indication of a dominant conduit. Slightly higher up-glacier borehole
   patterns were less coherent, and varied from year to year, probably a
   result of subglacial karst capturing basal waters at a number of low
   pressure points at the bed. Therefore both the upper and lower arrays at
   Small River Glacier appear to encompass unusual drainage conditions. The
   nearest neighbour analysis provides valuable constraints on more
   specific interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous subglacial measurements of turbidity and electrical
   conductivity - two indicators of basal water quality can be used to help
   characterize subglacial drainage systems. These indicators of water
   quality yield information that complements that provided by water
   pressure measurements. Quantitative attributes of subglacial drainage
   systems, such as water velocity and subglacial residence time, as well
   as qualitative behaviour - for example, spatial and temporal variations
   in system morphology - can be deduced using water quality measurements.
   Interpretation is complicated by the many potential influences on
   turbidity and electrical conductivity, but when these complications are
   appreciated a richer interpretation results. To demonstrate the utility
   of basal water quality measurements, observations from Trapridge
   Glacier, Yukon Territory, Canada were examined. The data reveal complex
   behaviour of the drainage system, but constraints imposed by basal water
   quality measurements help to clarify the nature of the subglacial flow
   system. The measurement and interpretation methods described and
   demonstrated are applicable to other glaciers. As such, they should
   prove useful for characterizing different subglacial drainage
   configurations and behaviours, thereby improving our general
   understanding of the hydrology and dynamics of wet-based glaciers.}},

Abstract = {{Two-hourly suspended sediment concentration variations observed during
   the summer of 1987 in the proglacial stream draining Midtdalsbreen,
   Norway are modelled using multiple regression and time series
   techniques. Suspended sediment fluctuations are influenced by stream
   discharge variations, diurnal hysteresis effects, medium-term sediment
   supply and transport variations and the recent suspended sediment
   concentration history of the stream. They do not appear to be influenced
   by seasonal exhaustion or rainfall variations. Possible reasons for this
   are discussed. Large positive residuals from the fitted models are major
   pulses of suspended sediment unrelated to discharge variations; these
   sediment flushes correlate with periods of enhanced glacier motion. They
   cannot be explained by enhanced sediment production by subglacial
   erosion, but are probably due to the tapping of subglacially stored
   sediment during sudden changes in the hydraulics and/or configuration of
   the subglacial hydrological system. Seasonal changes in the lag between
   glacier motion peaks and suspended sediment flushes suggest that the
   subglacial hydrological system evolves over the summer from a
   distributed to a more channelized configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Ice-sheet modelling typically uses grid cells 10 km or more on a side,
   so any hydrological and sliding model must average or parameterize
   processes that vary over shorter distances than this. Observations and
   theory suggest that basally produced water remains in a distributed,
   high-pressure system unless it encounters low-pressure channels fed by
   surface melt. Such distributed systems appear to exhibit increasing
   water storage, water transmission and water lubrication of sliding with
   increasing water pressure. A model based on these assumptions
   successfully simulates some aspects of the non-steady response of
   mountain glaciers to externally forced channel-pressure variations; it
   merits testing in ice-sheet modelling.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation was carried out to identify trends in the rainfall and
   temperature regimes of the Ganga basin in India and in India as a whole.
   Long-term data on the monsoon and annual rainfall and the average annual
   temperature for India as a whole, and on the monsoon rainfall, number of
   rainy days and annual maximum temperature of the Ganga basin were
   analysed. The trends in these data were detected using non-parametric
   methods. The results of this study showed that the rainfall variables
   had a decreasing trend and the temperature had an increasing trend.
   These trends were observed to have begun around the second half of the
   1960s, and have implications for the Indian economy. As the Indian
   economy continues to be based on agriculture, water resource management
   for irrigation plays a vital part in its growth. Present methods of
   design and management for water resource systems assume the climatic
   regime to be stationary. If indeed the climatic regime has changed, it
   will be necessary to develop new management approaches which consider
   this change.}},

Abstract = {{The primary purpose of this study is to develop the regional flow
   duration curves for southern Taiwan. To define homogeneous regions for
   developing regional flow duration curves, multivariate statistical
   analysis (principal component and cluster analysis) was applied to daily
   flow data from 34 stream-gauged stations in southern Taiwan. Two kinds
   of clustering variables, the dimensionless flow duration curve and
   specific flow duration curve, were compared in this study. It was found
   that three homogeneous regions delineated by specific flow duration
   curves as clustering variables have more reasonable results. The three
   homogeneous regions not only have well-defined geographical boundaries,
   but also correspond to the rainfall and geology characteristics of the
   regions. It seems that the technique of cluster analysis can reasonably
   define the homogeneous regions. In each homogeneous region, the
   synthetic regional flow duration curves were developed by a family of
   parametric duration curves. This approach has the advantage of being
   simple and needing only the basin area as an index. The performance of
   the regional flow duration curve was verified by the comparison of areas
   under the actual and synthetic flow duration curves; the latter were
   generated from the regional flow duration curve. Almost all the 34
   stream-gauged stations had less than 25\% absolute error.}},

Abstract = {{A long-term water balance model has been developed to predict the
   hydrological effects of land-use change (especially forest clearing) in
   small experimental catchments in the south-west of Western Australia.
   This small catchment model has been used as the building block for the
   development of a large catchment-scale model, and has also formed the
   basis for a coupled water and salt balance model, developed to predict
   the changes in stream salinity resulting from land-use and climate
   change. The application of the coupled salt and water balance model to
   predict stream salinities in two small experimental catchments, and the
   application of the large catchment-scale model to predict changes in
   water yield in a medium-sized catchment that is being mined for bauxite,
   are presented in Parts 2 and 3, respectively, of this series of papers.
   The small catchment model has been designed as a simple, robust,
   conceptually based model of the basic daily water balance fluxes in
   forested catchments. The responses of the catchment to rainfall and pan
   evaporation are conceptualized in terms of three interdependent
   subsurface stores A, B and F. Store A depicts a near-stream perched
   aquifer system; B represents a deeper, permanent groundwater system; and
   F is an intermediate, unsaturated infiltration store. The responses of
   these stores are characterized by a set of constitutive relations which
   involves a number of conceptual parameters. These parameters are
   estimated by calibration by comparing observed and pre dieted runoff.
   The model has performed very well in simulations carried out on Salmon
   and Wights, two small experimental catchments in the Collie River basin
   in south-west Western Australia. The results from the application of the
   model to these small catchments are presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{A long-term salt balance model is coupled with the small catchment water
   balance model presented in Part 1 of this series of papers. The salt
   balance model was designed as a simple robust, conceptually based model
   of the fundamental salt fluxes and stores in forested and cleared
   catchments. The model has four interdependent stores representing salt
   storage in the unsaturated zone, the deep permanent saturated
   groundwater system, the near-stream perched groundwater system and in a
   `salt bulge' just above the permanent water-table. The model has
   performed well in simulations carried out on Salmon and Wights, two
   small experimental catchments in south-west Western Australia. When
   applied to Wights catchment the salt balance model was able to predict
   the stream salinities prior to clearing of native forests, and the
   increased salinities after the clearing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an application of a long-term, large
   catchment-scale, water balance model developed to predict the effects of
   forest clearing in the south-west of Western Australia. The conceptual
   model simulates the basic daily water balance fluxes in forested
   catchments before and after clearing. The large catchment is divided
   into a number of subcatchments (1-5 km(2) in area), which are taken as
   the fundamental building blocks of the large catchment model. The
   responses of the individual subcatchments to rainfall and pan
   evaporation are conceptualized in terms of three interdependent
   subsurface stores A, B and F, which are considered to represent the
   moisture states of the subcatchments. Details of the subcatchment-scale
   water balance model have been presented earlier in Part 1 of this series
   of papers. The response of any subcatchment is a function of its local
   moisture state, as measured by the local values of the stores. The
   variations of the initial values of the stores among the subcatchments
   are described in the large catchment model through simple, linear
   equations involving a number of similarity indices representing
   topography, mean annual rainfall and level of forest clearing.
   The model is applied to the Conjurunup catchment, a medium-sized (39.6
   km(2)) catchment in the south-west of Western Australia. The catchment
   has been heterogeneously (in space and time) cleared for bauxite mining
   and subsequently rehabilitated. For this application, the catchment is
   divided into 11 subcatchments. The model parameters are estimated by
   calibration, by comparing observed and predicted runoff values, over a
   18 year period, for the large catchment and two of the subcatchments.
   Excellent fits are obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Two small experimental catchments were established in the south-west of
   Western Australia to study the effects of logging and subsequent
   regeneration on the mechanism of streamflow generation. Following a six
   year pre-treatment calibration period (1976-1981), one catchment (March
   Road) was logged and reforested in 1982 and the other (April Road South)
   remained as a control.
   Logging resulted in an increase in groundwater levels and subsequently
   groundwater discharge area. The deep, permanent groundwater levels in
   the valley and upslope areas rose until 1986 and then began to decline.
   The maximum rise was 5 m in the upslope areas. The duration of shallow,
   intermittent groundwater system, perched on underlying clay, was
   extended from 2-3 months in winter before logging to 5-6 months after
   logging. The shallow groundwater level rose in the valley and began to
   discharge at the ground surface in 1986.
   Logging resulted in an increase in streamflow. The maximum increase
   (approximate to 18\% of annual rainfall) was in 1983, one year after
   logging. The increase in streamflow was due to a substantial decrease in
   interception and evapotranspiration, increased recharge to the shallow
   groundwater system, decreased soil moisture deficit and consequently an
   increase in throughflow. The increase in base flow was about twice that
   of quick flow. The changes in streamflow and its components in the
   subsequent years were closely related to the groundwater discharge area.
   Most of the quick how was generated as saturation excess overland flow
   from the groundwater discharge area in the valley. The expansion of the
   groundwater discharge area, increased soil moisture content, higher
   groundwater level and the presence of the shallow groundwater system for
   the extended periods were responsible for the process of streamflow
   generation.}},

Abstract = {{The instantaneous salt dilution method for water discharge measurements
   in open channels has been improved by the development of a new
   instrument measuring conductivity. The salt method consists of two
   parts: the calibration and the actual measurement in the stream. The
   calibration aims to calculate the linear relationship between electrical
   conductivity and salt concentration at various degrees of dilution in a
   salt solution. The original undiluted solution is injected into the
   water of a stream and the conductivity is measured downstream from the
   injection site. When measuring, the new instrument integrates the
   conductivity over time. From the value obtained on the instrument's
   display, the water discharge can easily be calculated on a hand-PC in
   the field. The instrument has eliminated the subsequent calculation work
   formerly necessary. It has increased the accuracy of the method and also
   reduced the need for field personnel during measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for the detection and estimation of trends which are suitable
   for the type of data sets available from water quality and atmospheric
   deposition monitoring programmes are considered. Parametric and
   non-parametric methods which are based on the assumption of monotonic
   trend and which account for seasonality through blocking on season are
   described. The topics included are heterogeneity of trend, missing data,
   covariates, censored data, serial dependence and multivariate
   extensions. The basis for the non-parametric methods being the method of
   choice for current large data sets of short to moderate length is
   reviewed. A more general definition of trend as the component of gradual
   change over time is consistent with another group of methods and some
   examples are given. Spatial temporal data sets and longer temporal
   records are also briefly considered. A broad overview of the topic of
   trend analysis is given, with technicalities left to the references
   cited. The necessity of defining what is meant by trend in the context
   of the design and objectives of the programme is emphasized, as is the
   need to model the variability in the data more generally.}},

Abstract = {{Trends in precipitation and surface water chemistry at a network of 15
   small watersheds (<10 km(2)) in the USA were evaluated using a
   statistical test for monotonic trends (the seasonal Kendall test) and a
   graphical smoothing technique for the visual identification of trends.
   Composite precipitation samples were collected weekly and surface water
   samples were collected at least monthly. Concentrations were adjusted
   before trend analysis, by volume for precipitation samples and by flow
   for surface water samples. A relation between precipitation and surface
   water trends was not evident either for individual inorganic solutes or
   for solute combinations, such as ionic strength, at most sites. The only
   exception was chloride, for which there was a similar trend at 60\% of
   the sites. The smoothing technique indicated that short-term patterns in
   precipitation chemistry were not reflected in surface waters. The
   magnitude of the short-term variations in surface water concentration
   was generally larger than the overall long-term trend, possibly because
   flow adjustment did not adequately correct for climatic variability.
   Detecting the relation between precipitation and surface water chemistry
   trends may be improved by using a more powerful sampling strategy and by
   developing better methods of concentration adjustment to remove the
   effects of natural variation in surface waters.}},

Title = {{Water quality trends at an upland site in Wales, UK, 1983-1993}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{183-203}},

Abstract = {{Ten years of detailed upland stream and bulk deposition water quality
   data from Plynlimon, mid-Wales, are examined for trend. A robust
   statistical test (the seasonal Kendall test) is applied and data are
   presented graphically. Smoothing techniques are used to highlight the
   patterns of change which underlie high data scatter. The graphs show
   long-term cycles within the data which violate the assumptions of common
   statistical tests for trend. These cycles relate to fluctuations in the
   weather patterns at Plynlimon. Even though the seasonal Kendall test is
   significant for some determinands, the evidence from the graphs suggests
   that many of these `trends' are unlikely to continue.
   For solutes in rainfall, there is no convincing long-term trend. There
   is a possible increase in ammonium concentrations, which may indicate an
   increasing atmospheric source generated by farming activities, but this
   will require a longer data series for confirmation. Several trace metal
   concentrations increased significantly part way through the study
   period, but later returned to the original levels. The bulk
   precipitation sea salt input has been uneven over the 10-year sampling
   period, with the highest inputs occurring during the wetter winters.
   For solutes in streamwaters, there are clear trends in dissolved organic
   carbon (DOG), iodine and bromide, which increase over time and may be
   attributed to an increase in organic decomposition in the catchment.
   Previous studies in Wales have shown similar behaviour for colour, which
   is related to DOG, but the corresponding changes for bromide and iodine
   are new. For most other streamwater determinands, any changes are masked
   by the effects of year to year variations in the quality and quantity of
   rainfall. For example, zinc and chromium variations parallel the
   corresponding rainfall quantity variations. The effect of rainfall
   quality variation is marked for marine-derived elements such as
   chloride. For sulphate, streamwater variations are inverted relative to
   chloride. This suggests that dry deposition may vary with weather
   conditions: high when the wind direction is from the land and low when
   weather systems are predominantly frontal and laden with sea salts.
   Alternatively, high sea salt rainfall may be affecting
   absorption/solubility reactions in the soils.
   There are four main conclusions. Firstly, there is no indication of
   changing acid deposition inputs or changing acidity within the runoff,
   despite a decline in UK sulphur dioxide emissions. Secondly, streamwater
   DOC has shown an increase over time, but there is no clear corresponding
   decrease in pH as might be expected from acidification theory. Thirdly,
   there are cyclical variations in bulk precipitation inputs and in
   streamwater quality, which mean that trends cannot be established even
   with 10 years of data. Long-term cycles are likely to exist in other
   environmental data and extreme care is required for the interpretation
   of trend, especially if data sets are short. This aspect strongly
   supports the continuation of long-term monitoring programmes over
   several decades. Finally, the graphical application strongly enhances
   data analysis and should be considered an essential component of trend
   investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Information on past and likely future trends in water temperature from
   different parts of the world is collated. The potential causes of trends
   in the thermal regimes of streams and rivers are many, but the existing
   database of water temperature information is inadequate to provide a
   global perspective on changes during the recent, let alone the more
   remote, past. Data from Europe suggest that warming of up to ca. 1
   degrees C in mean river temperatures has occurred during the 20th
   century, but that this trend has not been continuous, is distorted by
   extreme hydrological events, is not correlated with simple
   hydrometeorological factors and has been influenced by a variety of
   human activities. Predictive studies indicate that an accelerated rise
   in stream and river temperatures will occur during the next century as a
   consequence of global warming. However, forecasts must be tentative
   because future climatic conditions are uncertain and interactions
   between climate, hydrological and vegetation changes are complex.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the major sources and transport characteristics of
   heavy metals in the hydrological cycle. It is demonstrated that heavy
   metal releases to the environment have changed from 19th and early 20th
   century production-related activities to consumption-oriented factors in
   more recent times. The relative roles of particle size, sorption and
   desorption processes, partitioning and the chemical speciation of heavy
   metals on fine sediments are identified to understand the likely fate of
   heavy metals released into fluvial systems. It is argued that the
   spatial and temporal distribution of heavy metals in the river corridor
   depends not only on an understanding of metal solubility and speciation,
   but also on an understanding of sediment dynamics which control, for
   example, floodplain alluviation and the accumulation of metals in the
   bottom sediments of contaminated rivers, lakes and reservoirs. Existing
   long- and short-term records are examined to identify the current state
   of knowledge about the factors which affect heavy metal releases into
   aquatic environments. With limited exceptions, it is shown that few
   long-term studies of trends in heavy metal transport are available
   although, for some major rivers, limited data on trends in metal
   concentration exists. Palaeolimnological reconstruction techniques,
   based on an analysis of lake and reservoir sediments, are identified as
   a possible means of supplementing monitored records of heavy metal
   transport. Although numerous studies have suggested that trends in
   atmospheric contamination, mining and urbanization may be identified in
   the bottom sediment record, other research has shown that the
   radionuclide-based chronology and the heavy metal distribution within
   the sediment are more likely to be a function of post-depositional
   remobilization than the history of metal loading to the basin. Despite
   these limitations, it is shown that the incorporation of reservoir
   bottom sediment analysis into a heavy metal research programme, based in
   river corridors of Midland England, provides an opportunity to identify
   and quantify the relative contribution of point and non-point
   contributions to the heavy metal budget and to relate trends in metal
   contamination to specific periods of catchment disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{The roles of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) as key nutrients
   determining the trophic status of water bodies are examined, and
   evidence reviewed for trends in concentrations of N and P species which
   occur in freshwaters, primarily in northern temperate environments, Data
   are reported for water bodies undergoing eutrophication and
   acidification, especially water bodies receiving increased nitrogen
   inputs through the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen oxides (NOx).
   Nutrient loading on groundwaters and surface freshwaters is assessed
   with respect to causes and rates of change, relative rates of change for
   N and P, and implications of change for the future management of lakes,
   rivers and groundwaters. In particular, the nature and emphasis of
   studies for N species and P fractions in lakes versus rivers and
   groundwaters are contrasted. This review paper primarily focuses on
   results from North America and Europe, particularly for the UK where a
   wide range of data sets exists. Few nutrient loading data have been
   published on water bodies in less developed countries; however, some of
   the available data are presented to provide a global perspective. In
   general, N and P concentrations have increased dramatically (>20 times
   background concentrations) in many areas and causes vary considerably,
   ranging from urbanization to changes in agricultural practices.}},

   production driven by allochthonous (external to the water body) loading
   of nutrients, to production driven by autochthonous (in-lake) processes.
   This shift typically is accompanied by changes in species and biotic
   community composition, as an aquatic ecosystem is ultimately transformed
   into a terrestrial biome. However, this typically slow process can be
   greatly accelerated by human intervention in the natural biogeochemical
   cycling of nutrients within a watershed; the resulting cultural
   eutrophication can create conditions inimical to the continued use of
   the water body for human-driven economic purposes. Excessive algal and
   rooted plant growth, degraded water quality, extensive deoxygenation of
   the bottom water layers and increased fish biomass accompanied by
   decreased harvest quality, are some features of this process.
   Following the Second World War, concern with cultural eutrophication
   achieved an intensity that spurred a significant research effort,
   culminating in the identification of phosphorus as the single most
   significant, and controllable, element involved in driving the
   eutrophication process. During the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s,
   much effort was devoted to reducing phosphorus in wastewater effluents,
   primarily in the developed countries of the temperate zone. These
   efforts generally resulted in the control of eutrophication in these
   countries, albeit with varying degrees of success. The present effort in
   the temperate zone, comprising mostly developed nations, has now shifted
   to the control of diffuse sources of a broader spectrum of contaminants
   that impact human water use.
   In the developing countries of the inter-tropical zone, however, rapidly
   expanding populations, a growing industrial economy and extensive
   urbanization have only recently reached an intensity at which cultural
   eutrophication can no longer be ignored. Further, initial attempts at
   applying temperate zone control measures in this region have been
   largely unsuccessful. Modification of the temperate zone eutrophication
   paradigm will be needed, especially to address the differing climatic
   and hydrological conditions, if cultural eutrophication is to be
   contained in this region, where eutrophication-related diseases continue
   to be a primary cause of human distress.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous pathogenic agents have been found in freshwaters used as
   sources for water supplies, recreational bathing and irrigation. These
   agents include bacterial pathogens, enteric viruses, several protozoans
   and parasitic worms more common to tropical waters. Although infected
   humans are a major source of pathogens, farm animals (cattle, sheep,
   pigs), animal pets (dogs, cats) and wildlife serve as significant
   reservoirs and should not be ignored. The range of infected individuals
   within a given warm-blooded animal group (humans included) may range
   from 1 to 25\%. Survival times for pathogens in the water environment
   may range from a few days to as much as a year (Ascaris, Taenia eggs),
   with infective dose levels varying from one viable cell for several
   primary pathogenic agents to many thousands of cells for a given
   opportunistic pathogen.
   As pathogen detection in water is complex and not readily incorporated
   into routine monitoring, a surrogate is necessary. In general,
   indicators of faecal contamination provide a positive correlation with
   intestinal pathogen occurrences only when appropriate sample volumes are
   examined by sensitive methodology.
   Pathways by which pathogens reach susceptible water users include
   ingestion of contaminated water, body contact with polluted recreational
   waters and consumption of salad crops irrigated by polluted freshwaters.
   Major contributors to the spread of various water-borne pathogens are
   sewage, polluted surface waters and stormwater runoff. All of these
   contributions are intensified during periods of major floods. Several
   water-borne case histories are cited as examples of breakdowns in public
   health protection related to water supply, recreational waters and the
   consumption of contaminated salad crops. In the long term, water
   resource management must focus on pollution prevention from point
   sources of waste discharges and the spread of pathogens in watershed
   stormwater runoff.}},

Abstract = {{The term `trend' takes on a variety of meanings for groundwater quality
   in both a temporal and spatial context. Most commonly, trends are
   thought of as changes over time at either a regional or localized
   spatial scale. Generally water quality managers are most interested in
   changes associated with some form of human activity. Carefully defining
   what is meant by `trend' is a critical step in trend analysis and may be
   accomplished by formulating a statistical model which includes a trend
   component. Although there are a great many regional groundwater studies
   which provide a `snapshot' description of water quality conditions over
   an area at one point in time, there are relatively few which consider
   changes over time and fewer still which include a statistical analysis
   of long-term trend. This review covers both regional and localized
   studies of groundwater quality around the world, including a few
   snapshots, but focusing primarily on those studies which include an
   evaluation of temporal changes in groundwater quality. The studies
   include national assessments, agricultural case studies (the largest
   group, mostly regional in scope), urban case studies, and point source
   and hazardous waste case studies.}},

Abstract = {{Rainfall samples were collected from several hundred rainfall events. Up
   to nine samples per event were collected fi om sites 3-500m apart. They
   differed substantially in both concentration and composition, even
   though great care was taken to wash all collectors beforehand. Dryfall,
   storage and analytical procedures could not explain the variation.
   When data for rainfall events of similar size (but very different cation
   inputs) were examined, the major differences were associated with the
   prevailing wind direction. Events leading to high concentrations were
   associated with easterly winds and showed the influence of a marine
   source.
   Chemical concentration and composition were not altered by the
   occurrence of a drought year followed by a very wet year. The mean pH
   was 5.3 and ranged from 4.6 to 5.8. For a given event, a difference of
   0.5 often occurred between collection sites. Regular seasonal variations
   in the concentration of NO3-N and the NO3/NH4 ratio occurred, with the
   ratio being higher in summer due primarily to bush fires. Organic
   nitrogen comprised 14\% of total nitrogen.}},

Abstract = {{A rainfall event-based study allowed the examination of factors
   affecting the amounts and chemical concentrations of throughfall. The
   amount and frequency of antecedent rainfall was of influence in both
   forests, in that concentrations were higher with dry antecedent
   conditions. The debarking season influenced throughfall in the eucalypt
   forest.
   Potassium was the dominant cation in the throughfall of both forests,
   being 50\% of the sum of the major cations (Ca, Mg, Na and K) for the
   pines and 70\% for the eucalypts. The largest difference was in sodium,
   being 29\% of the combined cations for the pines and 10\% for the
   eucalypts. There was net uptake of hydrogen ions from rainfall for both
   forests, i.e. throughfall was less acid than rainfall, but release
   occurred for a significant proportion of events and was associated with
   higher rainfall pH. There was a small net input of NH4-N and NO3-N by
   the eucalypts. A more substantial input of both ions occurred in the
   pines. However, uptake and release of both ions occurred for different
   events in both forests.
   Throughfall samples taken during events showed that the chemical

   not always follow the cation trends through time.}},

Abstract = {{Some factors affecting stemflow chemistry were examined. For events of
   similar size, the amount and frequency of antecedent rainfall were
   important for both forests. Bark type was important for the eucalypts,
   as was the debarking season for the smooth-barked species. Correlations
   for tree basal area versus concentration were established for the pines
   and three eucalypt species. On average, stemflow was responsible for
   10\% of the nutrient input for the eucalypts and 11\% for the pines. For
   the pines, the cation composition is dominated by Na and K. Eucalypt
   stemflow is dominated by K.
   The relative inputs of inorganic nitrogen and the major cations are
   presented for the pines and four eucalypt species. There was a net
   uptake of NH4-N by the pines and a release of NO3-N. For the eucalypts,
   both were released by all species, except for E. melliodora which
   absorbed NO3-N. E. rossii dominated nitrogen release. Apart from E.
   melliodora, the pH of stemflow of all eucalypt species and pines was
   less than that of rainfall. The pH values for E. melliodora and rainfall
   were similar.
   The chemical concentration of stemflow samples taken during events was
   greatly influenced by the intensity and continuity of the rainfall, and
   different eucalypt species were influenced in different ways. The
   relative chemical inputs of rainfall, throughfall and stemflow of the
   principal cations, Ca, Mg, Na, and K, were very variable, even between
   events of similar total rainfall. The total cation average inputs in
   gha(-1) mm(-1) of rainfall were: for the eucalypts, rainfall 10.7
   (34\%), throughfall 17.4(55\%) and stemflow 3.4(11\%); and for the
   pines, rainfall 10.7 (32\%), throughfall 18.4 (55\%) and stemflow 4.7
   (14\%). Thus, on average, throughfall makes the major contribution, but
   in individual events of similar size, rainfall input can be anything
   from 25 to 78\% of the total for the eucalypts and 10 to 54\% for the
   pines. There is also a substantial variation in the cation composition
   of all three components.
   It was possible to make a reasonable assessment of the probable
   throughfall and stemflow inputs by considering antecedent conditions,
   season, and certain event characteristics such as the intensity and rain
   angle. For the eucalypt forest, the summer debarking of the
   smooth-barked species affected the concentration and volume of both
   throughfall and stemflow. For rainfall however, assessment of likely
   inputs was not possible except for some marine-influenced easterly
   events.}},

Abstract = {{Soil sampling design, the number of samples collected and the lateral
   variation of caesium-137 (Cs-137) in uneroded reference locations were
   extracted from previously published work. The focus was on published
   work which used Cs-137 reference inventory (Bq m(-2)) for qualitative or
   quantitative estimation of sediment redistribution (SRD) within the
   landscape. The objective of this study was to address one of the
   methodological concerns facing the Cs-137 technique - that is, the lack
   of a rigorous statistical treatment of reference locations. The limited
   attention paid to the reference location is not justified as `true'
   estimates of SRD are based on the assumption of an unbiased,
   independent, random probability sample estimate, commonly the arithmetic
   mean. Results from the literature survey indicated that only 11\% of the
   reference locations sampled for Cs-137 expressly stated that a
   probability sampling design was used (transect or systematic-aligned
   grid). The remaining locations were generally sampled using a
   non-probability based design, more commonly known as haphazard sampling.
   Of the 75 reference study areas identified only 40 provided enough
   information to determine the dispersion around the mean, and from this
   the coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated for all available data.
   The median CV was 19.3\%, with 95\% confidence limits of 13.0-23.4\%,
   indicating that approximately 11 random, independent samples would
   generally be necessary to adequately quantify the reference Cs-137 area
   activity with an allowable error of 10\% at 90\% confidence. Further
   analysis indicated that only one-third of the studies sampled a
   sufficient number of Cs-137 reference locations. This value would
   actually be lower as sampling frameworks were based on non-probability
   sampling procedures. For Cs-137 reference locations it is recommended
   that a probability sampling design be utilized, preferably the
   systematic-aligned grid method, and as a minimum first-order estimate
   about 11 samples should be collected for inventory estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Solute transport experiments using a non-reactive tracer were conducted
   on short, undisturbed, saturated columns of a sandy loam soil. All
   columns, 20 cm in diameter and 20 cm long, were collected along a
   transect of 35 m. Most of the soil columns had pre-existing macropores.
   The columns were leached at a steady flow-rate under pending conditions.
   The resulting breakthrough curves (BTCs) showed a large heterogeneity.
   Several of the BTCs displayed early breakthrough and long tailing. All
   the data were interpreted in terms of dimensional time moments, the
   classical convection-dispersion equation (CDE) and the mobile-immobile
   transport model (MIM). Experimental time moments were found to vary
   significantly among the different BTCs. Analysis of the time moments
   also revealed that the variance of the field-scale ETC was several times
   larger than the average of the local-scale variance. The pore water
   velocity upsilon and dispersion coefficient D were obtained by fitting
   the CDE to the local-scale BTCs, resulting in an average dispersivity of
   7.4 cm. Frequency distributions for the CDE parameters upsilon and D
   were equally well described by a normal or log-normal probability
   density function (pdf). When a log-normal pdf for D is considered, the
   variance of the log(e) transformed D values (sigma(lnD)(2)) was found to
   be 2.1. For the MIM model, two additional parameters were fitted: the
   fraction of mobile water, theta(m)/theta, and the first-order mass
   transfer coefficient, alpha. The MIM was more successful in describing
   the data than the CDE transport model. For the MIM model, the average
   dispersivity was about 2 cm. The MIM parameters upsilon, D and
   theta(m)/theta were best described by a log-normal pdf rather than a
   normal pdf. Only the parameter alpha was better described by a normal
   pdf Mobile water fractions, theta(m)/theta ranged from 0.01 to 0.98,
   with a mean of 0.43 (based on a log-normal pdf). When the CDE and MIM
   were applied to the data, the fitted pore water velocities, upsilon,
   compared favourably with the effective pore water velocities,
   upsilon(eff), obtained from moment analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Stemflow was evaluated in a water balance and its contribution to

   stemflow were measured for one year in a pine forest (Tsukuba, Japan) to
   determine each component of the water balance in the forest. Groundwater
   recharge rates by stemflow and throughfall were calculated from a mass
   balance method using chloride in subsurface waters. The stemflow in the
   water balance was relatively small when estimated as a value per canopy
   projected area of the tree in the forest. However, the results for the
   mass balance of chloride in subsurface waters indicated that it was
   impossible to disregard the stemflow in determining groundwater
   recharge. Although the ratio of stemflow to the net precipitation was
   small in the water balance, the effect of stemflow on groundwater
   recharge was relatively large.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial variability of soil water content was investigated for a
   6300 m(2) covered catchment on the Swedish west coast. The catchment
   podzol soil is developed in a sandy-silty till with a mean depth of 43
   cm and the dominant vegetation is Norway spruce. The acid precipitation
   is removed by a plastic roof and replaced with lake water irrigated
   under the tree canopies. On two occasions, in April and May 1993, TDR
   measurements were made at 57-73 points in the catchment using 15 and 30
   cm long vertically installed probes. The water content pattern at the
   two dates, which occurred during a relatively dry period, were similar.
   The range of water content was large, from 5 to 60\%. In May 1993
   measurements also were made in areas of 10 x 10 m, 1 x 1 m and 0.2 x 0.2
   m. The range and standard deviation for the 10 x 10 m area, which apart
   from a small-scale variability in soil hydraulic properties and fine
   root distribution also had a heterogenenous micro- and macro-topography,
   was similar to the range and standard deviation for the catchment. The 1
   x 1 m and 0.2 x 0.2 m areas had considerably lower variability.
   Semi-variogram models for the water content had a range of influence of
   about 20 m. If data were paired in the east-west direction the
   semi-variance reflected the topography of the central valley and had a
   maximum for data pairs with internal distances of 20-40 m. The
   correlation between soil water content and topographic index, especially
   when averaged for the eight topographically homogeneous subareas,
   indicated the macro-topography as the cause of a large part of the water
   content variability.}},

Abstract = {{Generally, the diffusive wave equation, obtained by neglecting the
   acceleration terms in the Saint-Venant equations, is used in flood
   routing in rivers. Methods based on the finite-difference discretization
   techniques are often used to calculate discharges at each time step. A
   modified form of the diffusive wave equation has been developed and new
   resolution algorithms proposed which are better adapted to flood routing
   along a complex river network. The two parameters of the equation,
   celerity and diffusivity, can then be taken as functions of the
   discharge. The resolution algorithm allows the use of any distribution
   of lateral inflow in space and time. The accuracy of the new algorithms
   were compared with a traditional algorithm by numerical experimentation.
   Special attention was given to the instability caused by the inflow
   signal which constitutes the upstream boundary condition. For the fully
   diffusive wave flood routing problem, all three algorithms tested gave
   good results. The results also indicate that the efficiency of the new
   algorithms could be significantly improved if the position of the x-axis
   is modified by rotation. The new algorithms were applied to flood
   routing simulation over the Gardon d'Anduze catchment (542 km(2)) in
   southern France.}},

Abstract = {{A study was undertaken during the winter of 1990-1991 in a small (3.7
   ha) Canadian Shield catchment to examine the hydrological and
   hydrochemical response during rain-on-snow events. The results are
   presented of two large (37.9 and 34.6 mm) rain-on-snow events occurring
   in early and late March 1991. Peak and total runoff and the groundwater
   response from the two events are significantly different. Hydrological
   data indicate that these differences can be attributed to a combination
   of meteorological (temperature) and physical conditions (antecedent
   snowpack ripeness, soil moisture and groundwater levels). An immature
   snowpack (low temperature and density) combined with low antecedent soil
   moisture conditions significantly reduced the magnitude of the net
   hydrological input and runoff from the catchment during the early March
   event, whereas a more mature snowpack and high antecedent soil moisture
   conditions led to a large runoff event during late March.
   During both rain-on-snow events a significant portion of the pre-event
   snowpack chemical load was lost. Based on the maximum snowpack chemical
   load measured before the events, the two large rain-on-snow events and a
   brief mid-March warm period during which there were two much smaller
   rain-on-snow events removed 78\% of the hydrogen ion and 63\% of the
   sulphate and nitrate load from the snowpack, while only reducing
   snowpack water equivalence by 7\%. A two-component (rain and snowmelt)
   isotopic (delta(18)O SMOW parts per thousand) separation of snowmelt
   lysimeter water during the two events indicated that snowmelt was an
   important (50 and 65\%, respectively) water source available for
   infiltration and runoff at the snow-soil interface. Considering the high
   hydrogen ion loadings to the catchment during these two events (3.3 and
   3.0 mequiv. m(-2), respectively) streamflow pH was not significantly
   reduced due to an increase in the discharge of well-buffered
   groundwater. A two-component isotopic hydrograph separation of peak
   stream discharge during the 2-3 March event indicated that 75\% of the
   total flow was groundwater. In mid-latitude acid-sensitive catchments,
   winter rain-on-snow events are an important hydrological occurrence due
   to their ability to elute much of the chemical load (H+, SO4, NO3) from
   the snowpack before the onset of spring melt when the maximum annual
   hydrological input typically occurs.}},

Abstract = {{An approach to spatially distribute a snow process model by segmenting
   images of land cover, terrain and snow properties is reported. A small
   1.7 ha study area with an existing database was selected for this
   preliminary evaluation. The methodology was carried out over a
   relatively flat valley bottom at Camp Grayling, Michigan. Meteorological
   measurements on two sides of the area showed only small differences, so
   uniform meteorological variables were assumed over the site. Initial
   snow cover conditions were reconstructed and were distributed over the
   area using snow maps and sparse snow pit measurements. One metre
   resolution terrain, soil, vegetation and snow type maps were
   individually processed into class maps. These layers were then combined
   to produce a segmented class map, where the attributes from the data
   layers were known for each class. A one-dimensional model of snow
   processes was run for each class, then the results were mapped back into
   images. Shallow snow conditions provided high sensitivity of ablation
   patterns to meteorological conditions over a 72 h period. The model
   performance was assessed by comparing predicted and observed ablation
   patterns. The error in total snow-covered area was less than 9\%.
   However, the location errors were greater (predicted snow where no snow
   was observed and observed snow where no snow was predicted). Extensive
   error analysis was not justified because of the lack of multiple point
   measurements of snow properties.}},

Abstract = {{The Tretyakov non-recording precipitation gauge has been used
   historically as the official precipitation measurement instrument in the
   Russian (formerly the USSR) climatic and hydrological station network
   and in a number of other European countries. From 1986 to 1993, the
   accuracy and performance of this gauge were evaluated during the WMO
   Solid Precipitation Measurement Intercomparison at 11 stations in
   Canada, the USA, Russia, Germany, Finland, Romania and Croatia. The
   double fence intercomparison reference (DFIR) was the reference standard
   used at all the Intercomparison stations in the Intercomparison. The
   Intercomparison data collected at the different sites are compatible
   with respect to the catch ratio (measured/DFIR) for the same gauge, when
   compared using mean wind speed at the height of the gauge orifice during
   the observation period.
   The Intercomparison data for the Tretyakov gauge were compiled from
   measurements made at these WMO intercomparison sites. These data
   represent a variety of climates, terrains and exposures. The effects of
   environmental factors, such as wind speed, wind direction, type of
   precipitation and temperature, on gauge catch ratios were investigated.
   Wind speed was found to be the most important factor determining the
   gauge catch and air temperature had a secondary effect when
   precipitation was classified into snow, mixed and rain. The results of
   the analysis of gauge catch ratio versus wind speed and temperature on a
   daily time step are presented for various types of precipitation.
   Independent checks of the correction equations against the DFIR have
   been conducted at those Intercomparison stations and a good agreement
   (difference less than 10\%) has been obtained. The use of such
   adjustment procedures should significantly improve the accuracy and
   homogeneity of gauge-measured precipitation data over large regions of
   the former USSR and central Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental results are reported for dissolved solids concentration
   increase when clear meltwaters from the surface of an Alpine glacier
   were reacted with suspended sediment derived from the subsole. The
   experiments, at Findeleng-letscher, Switzerland, were conducted at
   temperatures of about 1 degrees C. Rates of reaction, which decrease
   through time as solute content rises, were slower in meltwaters which
   had not been allowed to equilibrate with the atmosphere before sediment
   was added. Diurnal variations in transit times of meltwater from the
   surface to the glacier portal were derived from injections of rhodamine
   dye into large moulin-conduit systems. Experimentally-determined rates
   of increase of electrical conductivity were used together with observed
   transit times in a Lagrangian formulation. This model was used to assess
   the contributions of rate of reaction and flow-through velocity to
   production of observed variations of solute concentration with portal
   meltwater discharge. The observed diurnal concentrations varied
   inversely but in phase with portal discharge. Diurnal variations in
   discharge through such moulin-conduit systems lead to substantial
   changes in flow-through velocity, altering the periods of time available
   for parcels of meltwater to react with basally-entrained suspended
   sediment en route to the portal. Hence, there is considerable
   variability in the amount of solute acquired by meltwaters in transit. A
   diurnal pattern of solute concentration variation with discharge is
   generated by the model, although absolute levels of solute concentration
   are underestimated. Parcels of meltwaters flowing more slowly, having
   entered the glacier down small cracks, crevasses and tiny moulins,
   acquire larger concentrations of solute during longer transit times.
   These waters, which cumulatively account for a significant proportion of
   total discharge, mix with those traversing moulin-conduit systems and
   presumably raise the overall solute content of the total discharge from
   Findelengletscher to the measured levels.}},

Abstract = {{Runoff from a small glacierized catchment in the Canadian high Arctic
   was monitored throughout one melt season. The stream discharge record is
   one aspect of a larger project involving glacier mass balance,
   superimposed ice formation and local climate on a glacier in the
   Sawtooth Range, Ellesmere Island, Northwest Territories, Canada. To
   better understand the main factors influencing the production of runoff
   on the glacier during the period of main summer melt, regression
   analyses were performed relating daily air temperature, shortwave
   incoming and net radiation, absorptivity and wind speed to daily glacier
   discharge. Air temperature at the glacier meteorological station on
   rain-free days is the element with the greatest correlation with runoff
   (r(2) = 0.57; n = 34). A multiple regression of discharge with air
   temperature, shortwave incoming radiation, net radiation hours and wind
   speed achieved the best fit (r(2) = 0.84; n = 34). Rain events (> 10 mm
   d(-1)) can dominate daily discharge when they occur during the period of
   ice melt, creating more runoff per unit area than can be produced by
   melt alone, and significantly reduce the accuracy of runoff predictions.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of trees on the ground thermal regime is important to the
   overall winter energy exchange in a snow-covered, forested watershed. In
   this work, spatial zones around a single conifer tree were defined and
   examined for their controls on the snow cover, snow-ground interface
   temperatures and frozen ground extent. A large white spruce (Picea
   glauca), approximately 18 m tall with a crown diameter of 7.5 m and
   located in northern Vermont, was the subject of this study. The tree was
   instrumented with thermistors to measure the snow-ground interface
   temperature between the tree trunk and 6 m from the tree into
   undisturbed snow. Four distinct zones around the conifer are defined
   that affect the snow distribution characteristics: adjacent to the
   trunk; the tree well; the tree crown perimeter; and the unaffected area
   away from the tree. At the time of peak snow accumulation and during the
   ablation season, snow depth and density profiles were measured. The area
   beneath the canopy accumulated 34\% of the snow accumulated in the
   undisturbed zone. By the end of the ablation season, the depth of snow
   under the canopy had decreased to 18\% of the undisturbed snow depth.
   The tree and branch characteristics of spruce in this temperate climate
   resulted in a different snow depth profile compared with previous
   empirical relationships around a single conifer. A new relationship is
   presented for snow distribution around conifer trees that has the
   ability to better fit data from a variety of conifer types than
   previously published relationships. Less snow beneath the canopy led to
   colder snow-ground interface temperatures than measured in undisturbed
   snow. The depth of frozen ground in the different zones was modelled
   using a simple analytical solution that showed deeper frost penetration
   in the tree well than beneath the undisturbed snow.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of winter on methane (CH4) stored in pore water and
   emitted through snow was investigated in a temperate poor fen in New
   Hampshire over two winters. Methane accumulated beneath ice layers (1
   cm) deposited by freezing rain, resulting in snow-pore air mixing ratios
   as high as 140 ppmv during the first winter and 600 ppmv during the
   second. An early winter snow crust of 300 kg m(-3) caused no
   discontinuity in a linear mixing ratio profile and therefore was not
   observed to retard snowpack emissions. Methane concentration-depth
   profiles in pore water steepened and concentrations increased by as much
   as 400 mu M at the 10 and 20 cm depths as the ice cover formed. This
   suggests that the peat-ice cover plays an important part in CH4 build-up
   in pore water by limiting the transport of gases between the peat and
   the atmosphere. Pore water concentrations gradually declined through
   late winter. The seasonality of dissolved CH4 in pore water over two
   winters and one summer showed an average annual amplitude of 1.3 g CH4
   m(-2) (25-75 cm depth range), with a winter maximum of 4.7 g CH4 m(-2).
   Emissions during the winter with average snowfall accounted for a larger
   percentage (9.2\% in 1993-1994) of total annual emission than the winter
   with below-average snowfall and warmer air temperature (2\% in
   1994-1995). Emissions averaged 56 and 26 mg m(-2) day(-1) during the
   first and second winter (December, January and February), respectively.}},

Abstract = {{There is little knowledge available about infiltration and evaporation
   processes in wadi channels in arid regions. This work was conducted to
   determine the actual evaporation from bare soils in wadi channels in the
   south-western region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The estimation of
   soil evaporation is highly dependent on the availability of moisture in
   the upper layers of aluvial wadis, in which the areal rainfall, flood
   hydrograph and soil properties play a significant part.
   The study was conducted by estimating the actual evaporation using soil
   moisture data, precipitation and runoff depths in a representative
   basin. The results are compared with potential rates. The actual rates
   were 1.5 mm/day immediately after a rainy day and then decreased to 0.42
   mm/day. The minimum rate was about 0.1-0.2 mm/day during the dry season.
   The potential rates were about 9.5 mm/day in June and July, decreasing
   to 3.5 mm/day in December and January.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1986 the multiple benefits of moso-bamboo forest, a special forest
   type found mainly in south China, have been investigated in a small 11.7
   ha watershed in Fenyi County, Jiangxi Province. The mean annual
   precipitation in the study area is 1593.3 mm. For the 0-60 cm soil layer
   the average soil bulk density is 1.00 g/cm(3), and the mean values For
   other soil properties are: total porosity 71.74\%; non-capillary
   porosity 5.81\%; and water retention capacity 430 mm. The maximum
   effective water retention capacity of 313 mm is 28\% higher than that
   for Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantations and natural
   broadleaved forest in the neighbouring area. The parameters f(o), f(c)
   and k, in Horton's infiltration equation, measured using the double-ring
   method under drought conditions, are 29.10 mm/min, 8.28 mm/min and
   0.2391, respectively. These infiltration properties are more favourable
   than those under nearby Chinese fir plantations.
   Compared with a Chinese fir plantation, the canopy interception ratio of
   moso-bamboo is lower, but the stemflow ratio is higher. The annual
   canopy interception ratio is 11.1\%. Because of snowfall, the
   interception ratios in January, February and March are higher, with
   values of 12.1-17.2\%, whereas during the period of leaf fall in April,
   May and June the interception ratios are lower with values of 9.2-9.5\%.
   During the other months they are relatively constant. The annual
   stemflow ratio is 4.4\%. Again, because of snowfall, the stemflow ratios
   in January, February and March are lower with values of 2.8-2.9\%,
   whereas during the remaining months they are fairly constant.
   Runoff analysis shows that the annual runoff ratio in this research
   watershed is 54.8\%, but the ratio for quick runoff, composed of direct
   runoff and surface runoff, is only 0.8\%. The upper interflow ratio is
   15\% and the ratio for the slow runoff composed of deeper interflow and
   underflow is 39\%. The moso-bamboo forest is very effective in reducing
   peak runoff and increasing low flows.
   The annual nutrient element inputs (kg/ha) to the moso-bamboo forest
   ecosystem associated with throughfall and stemflow are N 17.7, P 0.38, K
   56.5, Ca 31.4, Mg 4.8 and SiO2 26.2, respectively. All the measured
   element inputs, with the exception of P, are higher than those
   associated with precipitation in the open, where typical values are N
   10.1, P 0.89, K 18.8, Ca 25.8, Mg 3.1 and SiO2 10.1. The annual outputs
   in streamflow are N 3.0, P 0.28, K 16.6, Ca 38.9, Mg 8.3 and SiO2 125.7,
   indicating that for N, P and K the moso-bamboo forest ecosystem is an
   accumulating system, whereas for Ca, Mg and SiO2 the reverse applies.
   All the pH values associated with precipitation in the open,
   throughfall, stemflow, surface runoff from runoff plots and streamflow
   in the research watershed vary between 6.45 and 7.60 and are close to
   neutral.}},

Abstract = {{Toxic cyanobacteria have become a common nuisance in freshwater lakes
   and reservoirs throughout the world. some times resulting in the closure
   of sites with high amenity value. Cyanobacteria are able to regulate
   their buoyancy state in response to changing photosynthetic rates.
   Additionally, the cyanobacteria are liable to become entrained within
   wind-induced near-surface turbulent currents, resulting in mixing and
   mass transport. These movement processes have been modelled. A
   mathematical function is presented which describes light- and
   nutrient-limited cyanobacterial growth. The growth model is integrated
   with a previous movement model (SCUM: simulation of cyanobacterial
   underwater movement) as movement patterns and wind-induced lake mixing
   strongly affect the intensity and duration of light received by the
   cyanobacteria and thereby determine the photosynthetic potential.
   Results of the model suggest that cyanobacteria are resistant to periods
   of lake mixing and continue to increase their biomass, but at a
   depressed rate. Growth is most rapid under calm conditions. The results
   agree well with field-based findings, confirming the validity of the

Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{821-832}},
Month = {{AUG-OCT}},
Abstract = {{A qualitative discussion is presented on the concept of a representative
   elementary area (REA) proposed by Wood et al. (1988). Their work
   represents a systematic effort of looking at spatial variability as
   functions of scale, and over the past few years has stimulated new
   thoughts and research findings. However, it is argued here that the REA
   concept has limited utility in catchment hydrology for the following
   reasons. Firstly, the method of finding the REA using distributed
   modelling appears flawed. In estimating local runoff, point-process
   models are applied to elements of 30 x 30 m(2) or larger, but the effect
   of this particular upscaling on the calculated REA has not been
   addressed. This causes the REA to be relative to the resolution of the
   modelling. Secondly, an REA does not seem to exist in a natural
   environment because of its relativeness in the presence of multi-scale
   heterogeneity and its dependence on individual storm events. Based on
   the above arguments and following a discussion of the hydrological
   implications of REA, it is pointed out that the REA does not provide a
   definite and robust measure of the inherent spatial variability in
   runoff and that its utility in formulating large-scale hydrology is not
   as clear as it was first envisioned.}},

   reduction in the HCO3- concentration.
   The low flow hydrograph was separated into two components using HCO3-
   and Cl- concentrations in August 1989, assuming low flow to be a mixture
   of delayed subsurface flow and of quick shallow flow. The slight diurnal
   variation in the ratio of shallow flow to subsurface flow caused the

Abstract = {{This is the second in a series of three papers about the meta-channel
   concept which illustrates the derivation of the principles behind the
   concept, the construction of the hydraulic geometry and the application
   of the concept to flood routing, respectively. It was shown in the first
   of these that a channel network in a catchment can be conceptualized
   into a single `effective channel' representation: a meta-channel. This
   study uses this conceptualization to show how such a meta-channel can be
   constructed. The techniques derived are applied to one catchment in New
   Zealand. We derive hydraulic geometries expressed as functions of flow
   distance throughout this catchment based on the Leopold and Maddock
   power laws. This derivation uses classical published values for
   hydraulic geometry coefficients and exponents, regional parameterization
   of the index flood relationship for New Zealand as a whole, together
   with local knowledge regarding the order of magnitude of the channel
   roughness. Conservation principles derived from the continuity and
   mechanical energy balance equations are used to construct the hydraulic
   geometry of the meta-channel of this catchment. A meta-channel long
   profile is established and compared against the mainstream long profile.
   The effectiveness of the Leopold and Maddock power law assumptions is
   tested by comparing the derived hydraulic geometry against available
   field cross-sectional data for the gauging site at the outlet of the
   catchment.}},

   hydrological modelling, in which it is assumed that a model applicable
   at small scales can be applied at larger scales using `effective'
   parameter values, is an inadequate approach to the scale problem. It is
   also unlikely that any general scaling theory can be developed due to
   the dependence of hydrological systems on historical and geological
   perturbations. Thus a disaggregation approach to developing
   scale-dependent models is advocated in which a representation of the
   distribution of hydrological responses is used to reflect hydrological
   heterogeneity. An appropriate form of distribution may vary with both
   scale and environment. Such an approach is dependent on the data
   available to define and calibrate the chosen subgrid parameterization. A
   parameterization based on a minimum patch representation is suggested
   and the problems of identification at the larger scale discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Extrapolation of measurements of water use by individual trees to that
   for a stand of trees is a critical step in linking plant physiology and
   hydrology. Limitations in sampling resources and variation in tree sizes
   within a stand necessitate the use of some scaling relationship.
   Further, to scale tree water use in space as well as time, the
   relationship must reflect the changing availabilities of energy and
   water supply. It is argued here that tree leaf area is the most
   appropriate covariate of water use to achieve this aim. However,
   empirical results show that the relationship is not always linear. A
   theory is developed, based on the concepts of hydrological equilibrium
   (sensu Nemani and Running, 1989) and ecological field theory (Walker et
   al., 1989) which accounts for (occasional) non-linear behaviour of the
   flux/leaf area relationship in evergreen trees. A key feature of this
   theory is the notion of a non-linear, quasi-equilibrium reflecting plant
   water stress. An equation is derived from these concepts and a standard,
   explicit treatment of tree water use (Landsberg and McMurtrie, 1984),
   which is used to characterise this relationship. This equation has the
   form Q = aIA + b psi(s)A(f). The theory is tested against field data and
   published reports on Eucalyptus tree water use.}},

Abstract = {{Methodologies for developing a macro-scale model of subsurface stormflow
   generation on a steep forested catchment in Japan are addressed. Field
   studies on this catchment have indicated that subsurface flow,
   consisting mainly of `old' water displaced by `new' rain water,
   dominates the storm response. Detailed field measurements on the
   catchment allowed simple, catchment-scale relationships to be developed
   between the volume of saturated groundwater, on the one hand, and
   discharge, and surface and subsurface saturated areas, on the other.
   Attempts are made to find linkages between these empirical relationships
   and physically-based descriptions of hydrological processes operating at
   smaller scales. A distributed model based on the saturated-unsaturated
   groundwater flow on steep catchments was developed and tested with field
   data collected on this catchment. Derivation of catchment-scale
   relationships can be carried out by a straightforward integration of the
   distributed model output. An alternative disaggregation-aggregation
   approach is presented, whereby the catchment is divided into a number of
   hillslope flow strips. By applying the distributed model on each flow
   strip, under steady-state conditions, it is possible to infer the
   spatial variability of groundwater volume in the various flow strips.
   This variability is related to a measure of hillslope topography and
   geometry. Knowing the catchment topography and geometry for any
   catchment, it is then possible to derive useful catchment-scale
   relationships which are applicable under quasi-steady-state conditions.
   Hydrological relationships derived in this manner are compared with
   corresponding empirical relationships. The methodologies presented are
   effective for understanding the linkages between catchment scale
   response and small-scale flow processes.}},

Abstract = {{Runoff generation in natural catchments due to storm rainfall is highly
   complex and spatially and temporally heterogeneous. In recent work on
   seven small experimental catchments Larsen et al. (1994) showed that
   underlying the heterogeneity of runoff generation within the catchments,
   there is a degree of regularity between the catchments that could be
   quantified in terms of two dimensionless similarity parameters K-0{*}
   and f{*}. These two parameters, constants for a catchment, were able to
   characterize the relative dominance of the saturation excess
   (Dunne-type) and infiltration excess (Horton-type) mechanisms of runoff
   generation. Given that K-0{*} and f{*} can characterize the type of
   runoff generation on any catchment, it may follow that they can be used
   to define a catchment-scale runoff generation model. This idea is
   pursued in this paper. For the same catchments as studied by Larsen et
   al. (1994), a lumped, physically based model is developed that describes
   both the extent of saturated areas and the average infiltration capacity
   of the unsaturated areas during a storm. This is achieved by utilizing
   the distributed model used by Larsen et al. (1994) to aggregate the
   point-scale runoff generation responses, up to the catchment scale, from
   which the functional form and the parameters of the catchment-scale
   runoff generation model are inferred. The parameters of this lumped
   model are defined entirely in terms of the underlying distribution of
   topography, three similarity parameters K-0{*},f{*} and B{*}, the
   normalized average water-table depth, z{*}, and the normalized
   cumulative volume of infiltration, G{*}.}},

Abstract = {{Addressing scaling issues in hydrological modelling involves, among
   other things, the study of problems related to hydrological similarity
   between catchments of different scales. Recent research about catchment
   similarity relationships is based on distributed conceptual models of
   surface runoff production. In this type of hydrological modelling both
   infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff production mechanisms
   are considered. In many humid lowland areas overland flow is a rare
   phenomenon because of the specific conditions that prevail: moderate
   rainfall, high infiltration capacity and low relief. The complete
   drainage system in these regions consists of surface and subsurface
   components which have organized themselves in a given geological,
   geomorphological and climatic situation. A surface drainage network has
   developed through sapping erosion at the zone of groundwater
   exfiltration. The resulting hierarchical stream network is in
   equilibrium with large time-scale conditions and adjusts itself
   dynamically to the inter-year and seasonal meteorological fluctuations.
   Greater understanding of the interrelationships that underlie the storm
   response of catchments in humid lowland regions can be expected by
   focusing on stream network morphology as a function of topography,
   geology and climate. This paper applies the physically based
   mathematical model of stream network morphology, developed by De Vries
   (1977), to the Zwalmbeek catchment, Belgium. Based on this model and for
   different climatic conditions (expressed in terms of rainfall
   characteristics) the first-order stream spacing versus average
   water-table depth relationship is calculated. From field observations,
   digital elevation model derived channel network drainage densities and
   flood event analysis it is concluded that the 1\% exceedance probability
   rainfall can be suggested as representative for the shaping climatic
   conditions in the catchment under study, The corresponding curves
   relating channel network characteristics, such as stream spacing,
   drainage density and channel geometry, to average water-table depth are
   basin descriptors and could be used for comparative studies (e.g.
   regional flood frequency analysis). The model further allows for the
   prediction of the expansion and shrinkage of the first-order channel
   network as a function of catchment wetness expressed in terms of the
   effective water-table depth.}},

Abstract = {{This paper, part review and pare new work, falls into three main
   sections. The first is a review of scale issues in both hydrology and
   meteorology, focusing on their origins in the water and energy
   conservation equations, integrated over control volumes of different
   scales. Several guidelines for scale translations are identified.
   The second section reviews the upscaling problem in boundary-layer
   meteorology, setting out two `flux-matching' criteria for upscaling
   models of land-air fluxes: the conservation requirement that surface
   fluxes average linearly and the practical requirement that model form be
   preserved between scales. By considering the effects of boundary
   conditions, it is shown that the combination or Penman-Monteith equation
   is a model for elemental energy fluxes which leads to physically
   consistent flux-matching rules for upscaling surface descriptors
   (resistances). These rules are tested, along with some other
   possibilities, and found to perform well.
   The third section tests the hypothesis that regionally averaged energy
   balances over land surfaces are insensitive to the scale of
   heterogeneity, X. Heterogeneity is classified as microscale when X less
   than or equal to UmT{*}, mesoscale when UmT{*}less than or equal to X
   less than or equal to UmTe, and macroscale when UmTe less than or equal
   to X {[}where U-m is the mean wind speed in the convective boundary
   layer (CBL) and T{*} and T-e the convective and entrainment time scales,
   respectively]. A CBL slab model is used to show that regionally averaged
   energy fluxes are remarkably insensitive to X in both the microscale and
   macroscale ranges. Other reviewed evidence suggests that the mesoscale
   range behaves similarly in dry conditions. Questions remain about the
   consequences of clouds and precipitation for regionally averaged surface
   energy fluxes.}},

Abstract = {{Modelling experiments have been undertaken to address the effects of
   land surface heterogeneity on the energy and water fluxes at catchment
   scales. The simulation results indicate that in the presence of strong
   contrasts (i.e. patchiness) in the land surface characteristics (for
   example, soil moisture, leaf area index or vegetation type) significant
   inter-patch advection can result. For example, small areas with high
   levels of soil moisture surrounded by drier areas have a
   disproportionately high latent heat flux. The sensible heat flux showed
   a complementary suppression. The response to changes in leaf area index,
   however, was found to be much more complex. At constant soil moisture
   levels, it was found that under some conditions the latent heat flux of
   patches of high leaf area index increased as its proportion of the
   surface increased as a result of the increase in net radiation and
   roughness. There was also an increase in sensible heat flux. This effect
   was also found on surfaces with!ow moisture levels and strong contrasts
   in surface vegetation. Although these results do depend on the initial
   boundary layer and terrestrial conditions, a consequence of this is that
   significant biases can be generated in modelling catchment output if the
   heterogeneity effects are not fully accounted for. The model simulations
   demonstrate that the fluxes from a `homogenized' surface with
   catchment-average land surface properties (e.g. soil moisture) can be
   significantly higher than that for a heterogeneous surface with
   explicitly modelled inter-patch interactions. These results have
   particular implications for nested catchment models where the responses
   of individual subcatchments are as important as that of the total
   catchment. They are also significant in efforts towards developing
   lumped land surface parameterizations for use in atmospheric models such
   as general circulation models.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric vapour flux convergence is introduced for the estimation of
   the water balance in a river basin. The global distribution of vapour
   flux convergence, -del(H) .(\$) over bar Q is estimated using the
   European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts global analysis data
   for the period 1980-1988. From the atmospheric water balance, the annual
   mean -del(H) .(\$) over bar Q can be interpreted as the precipitation
   minus evaporation. The estimated -del(H) .(\$) over bar Q is compared
   with the observed discharge data in the Chao Phraya river basin,
   Thailand. The mean annual values are not identical, but their seasonal
   change corresponds very well. The four year mean -del(H) .(\$) over bar
   Q is also compared with the climatological runoff of nearly 70 large
   rivers. The multi-annual mean runoff is calculated from the Global
   Runoff Data Centre data set and used for the comparison. There is
   generally a good correspondence between the atmospheric water balance
   estimates and the runoff observations on the ground, especially in the
   mid- and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere. However, there are
   significant differences in many instances. The results emphasize the
   importance of accurate routine observations in both the atmosphere and
   river runoff. The global water balance of the zonal mean is compared
   with prior estimates, and the estimated value from this study is found
   to be smaller than previous estimates. The annual water balance in each
   ocean and each continent are also compared with previous estimates.
   Generally, the global runoff estimation using the conventional
   hydrological water balance is larger than the result by the atmospheric
   water balance method. Annual freshwater transport is estimated by
   atmospheric water balance combined with geographical information, The
   results show that the same order of freshwater is supplied to the ocean
   from both the atmosphere and the surrounding continents through rivers.
   The rivers also carry approximately 10\% of the global annual freshwater
   transport in meridional directions as zonal means.}},

Abstract = {{Many existing general circulation models (GCMs) use so-called `bucket
   algorithms' to represent land-surface hydrology. Wood et al. (1992)
   presented a generalization of the simple bucket representation, based on
   their variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model. The VIC model, in
   essence, assumes a statistical distribution of bucket sizes within the
   grid square. In this way, it provides a simple, computationally
   efficient and yet physically realistic model of land-surface hydrology.
   A preliminary attempt is made here, using this simple model, to evaluate
   the effects of the spatial variability of rainfall intensities and the
   resulting soil moisture within a hypothetical GCM grid square. Rainfall
   is assumed to be patchy, with only a fraction of the grid square being
   wetted by rainfall at any given time. Within the wetted area, however,
   rainfall is allowed to vary randomly in space. Evaporation during
   interstorm periods is estimated from the rest of the grid square by a
   simple non-linear function of the available soil moisture. The soil
   moisture is also assumed to be patchy and spatially variable due to the
   antecedent rainfall that caused it. A number of simplifying assumptions
   have been made in the model about the redistribution of soil moisture at
   the end of storm and interstorm periods, and the effects of a vegetation
   canopy have been ignored. The model is applied, under a variety of
   conditions, to estimate the biases in the modelled water balance fluxes
   if the assumed spatial heterogeneity is neglected. The model is also
   used to simulate the long-term water balance dynamics under assumed
   hypothetical storm and inter-storm climatic inputs, to see how the
   steady-state hydrological regime is affected by spatial variability.
   These simulations are relevant to current efforts towards developing
   simple parameterizations of land-surface hydrology that explicitly
   incorporate subgrid heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{To parameterize the land surface in global climate models (GCMs) data
   must be provided at a variety of resolutions. In GCMs, high-resolution
   data must be aggregated to the coarser resolution of the GCM. The method
   used for parameter aggregation can lead to the simulation of very
   different land surface climatologies. It is shown that the most
   important transition from a simulation of homogeneous tundra to one of
   homogeneous coniferous forest is the initial increase in forest. The
   differences between the simulation of tundra and the simulation of
   tundra with two-ninths coniferous forest are considerable. This suggests
   that the land surface is sensitive to the aggregated parameters in
   non-linear ways. It suggests that more care is needed in data
   aggregation, and that improved algorithms for data aggregation must be
   developed, because these data sets represent the foundations on which
   advanced land surface parameterizations are built. Finally, it shows
   that the influence of relatively small amounts of secondary vegetation
   should be represented in GCMs.}},

Abstract = {{A framework is provided for scaling and scale issues in hydrology. The
   first section gives some basic definitions. This is important as
   researchers do not seem to have agreed on the meaning of concepts such
   as scale or upscaling. `Process scale','observation scale' and
   `modelling (working) scale' require different definitions. The second
   section discusses heterogeneity and variability in catchments and
   touches on the implications of randomness and organization for scaling.
   The third section addresses the linkages across scales from a modelling
   point of view. It is argued that upscaling typically consists of two
   steps: distributing and aggregating. Conversely, downscaling involves
   disaggregation and singling out. Different approaches are discussed for
   linking state variables, parameters, inputs and conceptualizations
   across scales. This section also deals with distributed parameter
   models, which are one way of linking conceptualizations across scales.
   The fourth section addresses the linkages across scales from a more
   holistic perspective dealing with dimensional analysis and similarity
   concepts. The main difference to the modelling point of view is that
   dimensional analysis and similarity concepts deal with complex processes
   in a much simpler fashion. Examples of dimensional analysis, similarity
   analysis and functional normalization in catchment hydrology are given.
   This section also briefly discusses fractals, which are a popular tool
   for quantifying variability across scales. The fifth section focuses on
   one particular aspect of this holistic view, discussing stream network
   analysis. The paper concludes with identifying key issues and gives some
   directions for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Changing the scale of observation or averaging has a significant, but
   poorly understood, impact on the apparent variability of hydrological
   quantities. The representative elementary area (REA) concept is used as
   a motivation for measuring inter-storm streamflow and calculating
   wetness index distributions for the subcatchments of two small study
   areas in New Zealand. Small subcatchments are combined to provide larger
   scale samples, and then the variance of specific discharge between
   similar sized subcatchments is calculated. For small subcatchments (area
   less than similar to 1 km(2)) this variance is found to decrease with
   area more quickly than might be expected if the catchments were random
   samples. Such behaviour is tentatively interpreted as evidence
   supporting the concept of `organization'. At larger scales, variance
   between catchments decreases in a way that is consistent with sampling
   from a stationary random field. The results from the streamflow data are
   reinforced by an analysis of topographic data for the two study areas,
   although some questions remain open.
   Both the flow and topographic data support the idea that it is possible
   to find an averaging scale where the variability between catchments is
   sufficiently small for a `distribution function' approach to be used in
   distributed rainfall-runoff modelling. Consistent estimates of the scale
   at which the study areas become stationary (0.5 km(2) for Little Akaloa,
   2 km(2) for Lewis) are obtained using both flow and topographic data.
   The data support a pragmatic REA concept which allows meaningful
   averages to be formed: this may be a useful base for further conceptual
   developments, but it is not appropriate for a classical continuum
   approach. Further conceptual development combined with field measurement
   and computer simulation are still required for the REA to have
   operational impacts. In particular, it is not clear which models are
   appropriate for use at the REA scale.}},

Abstract = {{Since the paper of Wood et al. (1988), the idea of a representative
   elementary area (REA) has captured the imagination of catchment
   modellers. It promises a spatial scale over which the process
   representations can remain simple and at which distributed catchment
   behaviour can be represented without the apparently undefinable
   complexity of local heterogeneity. This paper further investigates the
   REA concept and reassesses its utility for distributed parameter
   rainfall-runoff modelling. The analysis follows Wood et al. (1988) in
   using the same topography and the same method of generating parameter
   values. However, a dynamic model of catchment response is used, allowing
   the effects of flow routing to be investigated. Also, a `nested
   catchments approach' is adopted which better enables the detection of a
   minimum in variability between large- and small-scale processes. This is
   a prerequisite of the existence of an REA.
   Results indicate that, for an impervious catchment and spatially
   invariant precipitation, the size of the REA depends on storm duration.
   A `characteristic velocity' is defined as the ratio of a characteristic
   length scale (the size of the REA) to a characteristic time-scale (storm
   duration). This `characteristic velocity' appears to remain relatively
   constant for different storm durations. Spatially variable precipitation
   is shown to dominate when compared with the effects of infiltration and
   flow routing. In this instance, the size of the REA is strongly
   controlled by the correlation length of precipitation. For large
   correlation lengths of precipitation, a separation of scales in runoff
   is evident due to small-scale soil and topographic variability and
   large-scale precipitation patterns. In general, both the existence and
   the size of an REA will be specific to a particular catchment and a
   particular application. However, it is suggested that a separation of
   scales (and therefore the existence of an REA), while being an
   advantage, is not a prerequisite for obtaining simple representations of
   local heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of small-scale heterogeneity in land surface characteristics
   on the large-scale fluxes of water and energy in the land-atmosphere
   system has become a central focus of many of the climatology research
   experiments. The acquisition of high resolution land surface data
   through remote sensing and intensive land-climatology field experiments
   (such as HAPEX and FIFE) has provided data to investigate the
   interactions between microscale land-atmosphere interactions and
   macroscale models. One essential research question is how to account for
   the small-scale heterogeneities and whether `effective' parameters can
   be used in the macroscale models. To address this question of scaling,
   it is important to carry out modelling studies by analysing the spatial
   behaviour of process-based, distributed land-atmospheric models and
   available data from land surface climate experiments such as those
   designed under ISLSCP (e.g. FIFE and BOREAS) and HAPEX (e.g.
   HAPEX-MOBILY, HAPEX-SAHEL) and GEWEX (e.g. GCIP) and from smaller scale
   remote sensing experiments. Using data from FIFE'87 and WASHITA'92, a
   soil moisture remote sensing experiment, analyses are presented on how
   the land surface hydrology during rain events and between rain event
   varies; specifically, runoff during rain events, evaporation between
   rain events and soil moisture. The analysis with FIFE'87 data suggests
   that the scale at which a macroscale model becomes valid, the
   representative elementary scale (REA), is of the order of 1.5-3
   correlation lengths, which for the land processes investigated appear to
   be about 750-1250 m. For the Washita catchment data, analysis of
   soil-based infiltration data supports an REA of this spatial scale, but
   model derived and remotely sensed soil moisture data appear to suggest a
   larger scale. Statistical self-similarity is investigated to further
   understand how soil moisture scales over the Washita catchment and to
   provide a basis for macroscale models.}},

Abstract = {{The concepts of simple scaling and multiscaling provide a new
   theoretical framework for the study of spatial or regional flood
   frequency relations and their underlying physical generating mechanisms.
   In particular, the scaling exponents in the power law relationship
   between flood quantiles and drainage areas contain a `basic signature of
   invariance' regarding the spatial variability of floods, and therefore
   suggest different hypotheses regarding their physical generating
   mechanisms. If regional floods obey simple scaling, then the slopes do
   not vary with return periods. On the other hand, if regional floods obey
   multiscaling, then the slopes vary with return periods in a systematic
   manner. This premise is expanded here by investigating the empirical
   variations in the scaling exponents in three states of the USA: New
   York, New Mexico and Utah. Distinct variations are observed in the
   exponents among several regions within each state. These variations
   provide clear empirical evidence for the presence of both simple scaling
   and multiscaling in regional floods. They suggest that
   snowmelt-generated floods exhibit simple scaling, whereas
   rainfall-generated floods exhibit multiscaling. Results from a simple
   rainfall-runoff experiment, along with the current research on the
   spatial scaling structure of mesoscale rainfall, are used to give
   additional support to these physical hypotheses underlying two different
   scaling structures observed in floods. In addition, the rainfall-runoff
   experiment suggests that the behaviour of the flood exponents in small
   basins is determined by basin response rather than precipitation input.
   This finding supports the existence of a critical drainage area, as has
   been reported for the Appalachia flood data in the USA, such that the
   spatial variability in floods in basins larger than the critical size is
   determined by the precipitation input, and in basins smaller than the
   critical size is determined by the basin response.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of digital elevation models (DEMs) has made it possible to
   objectively extract, calculate and store geomorphological parameters for
   hydrological modelling at several scales. For a grid-based DEM, the
   threshold area used to extract the channel network is analogous to the
   scale of the map produced. In addition to the map scale, the effects of
   the vertical resolution of the DEM on some frequently used
   geomorphological parameters in hydrology are examined using
   high-resolution DEMs of two natural and two artificial catchments. The
   vertical resolution was varied between 1 cm and 1 m, the most common
   vertical resolution of DEMs. At a fixed map scale, the mean absolute
   percentage error in the geomorphological parameters caused by a decrease
   in vertical resolution is within the range 0-5\% for the medium-sized
   catchments and 0-10\% for the small catchments studied. Although it is
   true that a change in vertical resolution may cause a change in the
   individual pixel slope, area and topographic index (area/slope),
   particularly in low relief terrain, their cumulative distributions do
   not show any significant change with the vertical resolution. The shape
   of the normalized width function is not very sensitive to the vertical
   resolution and the map scale. For small catchments order change may
   occur at different map scales for the different vertical resolution DEMs
   of the same catchment, causing a significant change in order-related
   parameters such as Horton ratios. It is suggested that the vertical
   resolution of the DEM of a catchment be considered satisfactory for most
   hydrological applications if the ratio of the average drop per pixel and
   vertical resolution is greater than unity. This ratio criterion could be
   used to define the minimum pixel area for reliable channel network
   definition for any given vertical resolution. The minimum pixel area
   places a lower bound on the horizontal resolution with which a channel
   network can be extracted from a DEM. These results could potentially be
   used to assess the adequacy for hydrological purposes of existing and
   proposed digital elevation databases.}},

Abstract = {{A model is proposed for predicting the spatial variation in colluvial
   soil depth, the results of which are used in a separate model to examine
   the effects of root strength and vertically varying saturated
   conductivity on slope stability. The soil depth model solves for the
   mass balance between soil production from underlying bedrock and the
   divergence of diffusive soil transport. This model is applied using
   high-resolution digital elevation data of a well-studied site in
   northern California and the evolving soil depth is solved using a finite
   difference model under varying initial conditions. The field data
   support an exponential decline of soil production with increasing soil
   depth and a diffusivity of about 50 cm(2)/yr. The predicted pattern of
   thick and thin colluvium corresponds well with field observations. Soil
   thickness on ridges rapidly obtain an equilibrium depth, which suggests
   that detailed field observations relating soil depth to local
   topographic curvature could further test this model. Bedrock emerges
   where the curvature causes divergent transport to exceed the soil
   production rate, hence the spatial pattern of bedrock outcrops places
   constraints on the production law.
   The infinite slope stability model uses the predicted soil depth to
   estimate the effects of root cohesion and vertically varying saturated
   conductivity. Low cohesion soils overlying low conductivity bedrock are
   shown to be least stable. The model may be most useful in analyses of
   slope instability associated with vegetation changes from either land
   use or climate change, although practical applications may be limited by
   the need to assign values to several spatially varying parameters.
   Although both the soil depth and slope stability models offer local
   mechanistic predictions that can be applied to large areas,
   representation of the finest scale valleys in the digital terrain model
   significantly influences local model predictions. This argues for
   preserving fine-scale topographic detail and using relatively fine grid
   sizes even in analyses of large catchments.}},

Abstract = {{The roles and limitations of geographical information systems (GISs) in
   scaling hydrological models over heterogeneous land surfaces are
   outlined. Scaling is defined here as the extension of small-scale
   process models, which may be directly parameterized and validated, to
   larger spatial extents. A process computation can be successfully scaled
   if this extension can be carried out with minimal bias. Much of our
   understanding of land surface hydrological processes as currently
   applied within distributed models has been derived in conjunction with
   `point' or `plot' experiments, in which spatial variations and patterns
   of the controlling soil, canopy and meteorological factors are not
   defined. In these cases, prescription of model input parameters can be
   accomplished by direct observation. As the spatial extent is expanded
   beyond these point experiments to catchment or larger watershed regions,
   the direct extension of the point models requires an estimation of the
   distribution of the model parameters and process computations over the
   heterogeneous land surface. If the distribution of the set of spatial
   variables required for a given hydrological model (e.g. surface slope,
   soil hydraulic conductivity) can be described by a joint density
   function, f(x), where x = x(1),x(2), x(3),... are the model variables,
   then a GIS may be evaluated as a tool for estimating this function. In
   terms of the scaling procedure, the GIS is used to replace direct
   measurement or sampling of f(x) as the area of simulation is increased
   beyond the extent over which direct sampling of the distribution is
   feasible. The question to be asked is whether current GISs and current
   available spatial data sets are sufficient to adequately estimate these
   density functions.}},

Abstract = {{A modified concept of hydrological response units (HRUs) for regional
   modelling of river basins using the PRMS/MMS model is presented. The
   HRUs are delineated by geographical information system (GIS) analysis
   from physiographic basin properties such as topography, soils, geology,
   rainfall and land use using a thorough hydrological systems analysis.
   The HRUs, once classified by GIS analysis, preserve the
   three-dimensional heterogeneity of the drainage basin. The River Brol
   basin (A = 216 km(2)), Rheinisches Schiefergebirge, Germany was selected
   to apply the concept. In total, 23 HRUs were delineated and tested with
   the PRMS/MMS model using a 20-year hydrometeorological daily database.
   The hydrological systems analysis revealed that interflow is the
   dominant flow process through the basin's slopes and the major
   contribution to groundwater recharge and river runoff. This was
   accounted for by parameterizing the HRUs in the model control file to
   drain their surplus water not used for satisfying the demand of
   evapotranspiration to a common conceptual subsurface storage. This
   storage was simulated by interflow drainage to the groundwater aquifer
   in the valley floor, which in turn drained to the channel network. The
   PRMS/MMS model simulated the observed daily discharge very well and the
   fit was described by a daily correlation coefficient of r = 0.91. The
   NASIM and HSPF models using different means to represent the basin's
   physiographic heterogeneity were applied to the Brill basin as well, but
   did not achieve this correlation. The HRU concept was found to be a
   reliable method for regional hydrological basin modelling and allows
   spatial up- and downscaling. Future research on this concept will focus
   on incorporating the variable precipitation distribution into the
   classification of HRUs and on the hydrodynamic routing of the modelled
   discharge. Additionally, satellite imagery must be used for classifying
   land use in macroscale drainage basins.}},

Abstract = {{The kinematic wave approximation is commonly used in the new generation
   of so-called physically based, distributed rainfall-runoff models.
   However, although the kinematic wave approximation is commonly accepted
   for channel and experimental flows, its applicability to actual
   hillslopes remains unvalidated. Because it is not possible to measure,
   nor model, all of the details of the flow on any realistic surface, we
   use subgrid approximations to provide an effective parameterization of
   the processes that occur on scales smaller than those that can be
   modelled. This paper explores different effective parameterizations, the
   data required to identify the correct parameterization, and the
   implications of not being able to identify all of the parameters on the
   scale dependence of flood hydrology. Data from small-scale plot
   experiments (100 m(2)) and large-scale catchments (1 km(2)) are used to
   explore these issues. It has been found that infiltration parameters can
   be adequately calibrated from small-scale plots. However, it is more
   difficult to calibrate the kinematic wave parameters using small-scale
   data alone. The conveyance properties of the hillslope cross-sections
   are parameterized by two kinematic wave parameters, c(r) and e(m), to
   yield the discharge Q = c(r)A(cs)(em)S(0.5) with S being the slope and
   A(cs) the cross-sectional area. It is shown that these two parameters
   are highly correlated, particularly when inferred from small-scale data.
   The surface roughness, amount of rilling and undulations of the surface
   all influence the kinematic wave parameters. The runoff response at
   large scales is very sensitive to changes in c(r) and e(m), yet is not
   readily apparent in small-scale data. Unfortunately, using small-scale
   data c(r) and e(m) cannot be estimated with acceptable precision to
   reliably extrapolate to larger scales. The significance of this
   behaviour is demonstrated and some possible solution strategies are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive measurements of the fluxes of phosphorus (P) and of P
   retention were carried out in a Danish lowland watershed (Gjern
   Angstrom) during two hydrological years (June 1987 to May 1989).
   Seasonal and short-term variations of P concentrations were measured by
   intensive automatic sampling covering P fluxes from the entire Gjern
   Angstrom watershed and two subcatchments: the Gelbaek and Lake Sobygard.
   Moreover, infrequent sampling was performed in all major tributaries of
   the river system. Transport of P compounds (dissolved and particulate P)
   exposed a seasonal pattern which was highly affected by flow conditions,
   instream processes, as well as point and non-point sources. Stormflow P
   transport during the two study years (1987-8 and 1988-9) constituted 56
   and 61\% in the Gelbaek, respectively, compared with 25 and 23\% in the
   Gjern Angstrom, respectively. Particulate P transport in the Gelbaek
   constituted 56 and 75\% of annual total P transport during the two years
   compared with 77 and 75\% in the Gjern Angstrom. The magnitude of
   monthly baseflow and stormflow total P loads was significantly
   correlated with the mean monthly discharge during baseflow and stormflow
   in the Gelbaek, whereas only stormflow loads were correlated to
   discharge in the Gjern Angstrom. In situ measurements of retention
   showed that the maximum amount of P stored in the Gelbaek during summer
   (June to August) was 22 g P m(-2) (1988) compared with 27 g P m(-2)
   (1987) in the Gjern A. Lake Sobygard was a P source during summer but a
   P sink during winter and on an annual basis the net P released was 810
   and 1420 kg, which corresponded to 7 and 20\% of the annual P export
   from the watershed, respectively. Retention constituted about 30\% of
   gross P transport in the Gelbaek during summer compared with 20\% in the
   Gjern Angstrom. Resuspension of retained P during stormflows in
   September 1987 constituted 94\% of the stormflow P transport and 54\% of
   the total P transport. Monthly total P and dissolved reactive P (DRP)
   mass balances for the main channel of the Gjern Angstrom revealed a
   significant DRP retention over 17 months (p < 0.05) caused by P
   adsorption on sediments and biological uptake. On an annual basis the
   main channel was a sink of DRP (1220 and 1660 kg P) but a source of
   total P (3440 and 1000 kg P), implying that the channel is an important
   source of particulate P. Bank erosion proved to be a significant P
   source in the main channel of Gjern Angstrom, whereas P delivery from
   soil erosion was possibly of minor importance. The annual non-point P
   export from two intensively sampled catchments was significantly higher
   (0.89 and 0.45 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1)) than from the five extensively
   sampled subbasins (0.43 and 0.17 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1)). No significant
   relationship could be established between non-point P export acid the
   proportion of arable land and soil type. Only for the wet year of 1987-8
   was a significant relationship established between non-point P export
   and the P load from scattered dwellings outside sewage areas in five
   subbasins.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater circulation is known to be one of the agents responsible for
   the redistribution of geothermal energy by acting as a source or sink in
   the course of its movement through porous media. Heat transport in
   groundwater systems is considered to be a coupled process and the theory
   based on this was used to analyse temperature profiles of 30 thermally
   stable observation wells in a deep, semi-confined aquifer system in the
   Tokyo Metropolitan area. Vertical water fluxes in the semi-confined
   aquifers and the associated upward heat fluxes were estimated from a
   heat flux equation that describes convection and conduction processes of
   heat transport in one dimension. The vertical downward water fluxes in
   Shitamachi lowland, Musashino and Tachikawa terraces were 0.69-26.91 x
   10(-9), 1.46-70.92 x 10(-9) and 2.61-2204 x 10(-9) m/s, respectively. A
   vertical upward water flux of 1.80-33.60 x 10(-9) m/s was estimated in
   Shitamachi lowland. The water flux generally decreased with increasing
   depth for observation wells which intercepted more than one
   semi-confining layer. The estimated upward heat fluxes for Shitamachi
   lowland, Musashino and Tachikawa terraces were 0.32-1.12, 0.49-1.21 and
   1.00-11.62 W/m(2), respectively. The heat flux was highest in Tachikawa
   terrace where a major fault, the Tachikawa fault, is located. Generally,
   the estimated heat Aux was higher in the semi-confining layers than in
   the aquifers. Areas with heat sources and sinks as well as groundwater
   flow patterns in the semi-confined aquifers were revealed by heat flux
   and temperature distributions in the study area.}},

Abstract = {{Topographic indices may be used to attempt to approximate the likely
   distribution of variable source areas within a catchment. One such index
   has been applied widely using the distribution function catchment model,
   TOPMODEL, of Beven and Kirkby (1979). Validation of the spatial
   predictions of TOPMODEL may be affected by the algorithm used to
   calculate the model's topographic index. A number of digital terrain
   analysis (DTA) methods are therefore described for use in calculating
   the TOPMODEL topographic index, ln(a/tan beta) (a = upslope contributing
   area per unit contour; tan beta = local slope angle). The spatial
   pattern and statistical distribution of the index is shown to be
   substantially different for different calculation procedures and
   differing pixel resolutions. It is shown that an interaction between
   hillslope contributing area accumulation and the analytical definition
   of the channel network has a major influence on calculated ln(a/tan
   beta) index patterns. A number of DTA tests were performed to explore
   this interaction. The tests suggested that an `optimum' channel.
   initiation threshold (CIT) may be identified for positioning river
   headwaters in a raster digital terrain model (DTM). This threshold was
   found to be dependent on DTM grid resolution. Grid resolution is also
   suggested to have implications for the validation of spatial model
   predictions, implying that `optimum' TOPMODEL parameter sets may be
   unique to the grid scale used in their derivation. Combining existing
   DTA procedures with an identified CIT, a procedure is described to vary
   the directional diffusion of contributing area accumulation with
   distance from the channel network.}},

Abstract = {{The chemistry of bulk precipitation and stream water was monitored in an
   acidic afforested catchment at Llyn Brianne in upland Wales between 1985
   and 1990. Throughfall, stemflow and soil water chemistry were also
   monitored between 1988 and 1989. Marine-derived solutes dominated the
   ionic composition of precipitation and stream water, which had mean Cl
   concentrations of 113 mu equiv. l(-1) and 245 mu equiv. l(-1),
   respectively. The higher concentrations in stream water reflect occult
   and dry deposition on the forest canopy and the effect of interception
   and transpiration losses. Chloride variations in stream water (112-454
   mu equiv.l(-1)) were damped compared with bulk precipitation (28-762 mu
   equiv.l(-1)) due to the mixing of event ('new') water with pre-event
   ('old') water in the catchment soils. A storm episode monitored in the
   catchment in April 1989 was associated with high sea salt inputs and Cl
   concentrations in throughfall (1466 mu equiv.l(-1)) and storm runoff
   were exceptionally high (392 mu equiv.l(-1)). The Cl signal in stream
   water during the episode was consistent with an event ('new') water
   contribution to the storm response. However, a short-term hydrochemical
   budget estimated that although CI outputs from the catchment during the
   event (1.17 kg ha(-1)) were equivalent to 8\% of inputs in throughfall
   and stemflow, the storm runoff was equivalent to 32\% of effective
   precipitation. This indicates that pre-event ('old') water was the
   dominant source (> 75\%) of storm runoff. Although sea salt inputs
   during the event had a marked impact on stream water chemistry, the
   anomalously high levels of acidity sometimes associated with sea salt
   events were not observed in this particular study.}},

Abstract = {{Methodological issues associated with isotopic hydrograph separations
   (IHSs) in built-up environments are explored using results from the 1990
   spring melt in a suburban basin in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. The
   heterogeneous nature of suburban environments complicates the selection
   of appropriate isotopic signatures for event and pre-event waters.
   Near-stream groundwater delta(18)O sampled from wells was poorly mixed,
   such that the pre-event water signature was best characterized by
   delta(18)O in pre-melt baseflow or discharge from a headwater spring.
   The event water signature during snowmelt can be characterized using
   delta(18)O in the pre-melt snowpack, surface runoff samples or meltwater
   from lysimeters. However, the use of snowpack delta(18)O may be
   inappropriate in suburban basins where meltwater from thin snowcover may
   exhibit pronounced responses to delta(18)O in rainfall contributions.
   Intensive sampling of the spatial variability of runoff or meltwater
   delta(18)O may be required to characterize the average event water
   signature adequately. Rainfall delta(18)O provided an appropriate event
   water signal during a large rain on snow event, and differences between
   this IHS and one generated using an event water signature that included
   meltwater contributions from snow-covered surfaces were within the
   uncertainty attributable to the analytical error in delta(18)O values.
   Event water supplied 55-63\% of the peak discharge and 48-58\% of total
   runoff from the basin during the melt, which is consistent with the
   fraction of the basin that has been developed. These results contrast
   with IHSs conducted in forested basins that suggest that stormflow is
   dominated by pre-event water contributions.}},

   were derived under simplified conditions for space-independent flows
   occurring on infiltrating planes or channels. These equations specify
   error as a function of time in the flow hydrograph. The kinematic wave,
   diffusion wave and dynamic wave solutions were parameterized through a
   dimensionless parameter gamma which is dependent on the initial
   conditions. This parameter reflects the effect of initial flow depth,
   channel bed slope, lateral inflow and channel roughness when the initial
   condition is non-vanishing; it reflects the effect of bed slope, channel
   roughness, lateral inflow and infiltration when the initial condition is
   vanishing. The error equations were found to be the Riccati equation.}},

Abstract = {{This pilot study uses a chemical technique (KEtX) to establish vertical
   profiles of average monthly water temperature within river beds: the
   hyporheic zone at the interface between surface water and groundwater.
   Data are presented for two gravel-bed sites and one sand-bed site on the
   River Wissey, Norfolk, UK.
   From February to October 1992, average monthly temperatures were
   determined at 10 cm intervals down Im profiles. A strong seasonal
   pattern was defined at all sites with hyporheic temperatures being
   relatively warm in winter and cool in summer. Isothermal periods
   occurred in March-April and September-October. Temperature ranges within
   the hyporheic were decreased (4.6-7.7 degrees C) compared with those of
   surface waters (10 and 10.9 degrees C). Temperature profiles were
   similar at all sites during winter, but the sand-bed site had relatively
   low temperatures at a standard depth within the hyporheic during summer
   and the temperature gradient became isothermal later in the autumn at
   this site. It is suggested that the influence of flows and substratum
   characteristics on temperature patterns, especially in regulated rivers,
   may have significant ecological implications, for example for
   determining the timing of salmonid fry and invertebrate emergence.}},

Abstract = {{Maps of the potential waterlogging of soils were generated using

   distribution of intensely waterlogged soils, provided the relationship
   between bedrock and the limit values is established. This approach can
   be used for several purposes: (1) to distinguish positional waterlogging
   from other types of waterlogging; (2) to control the quality and
   consistency of waterlogging maps; and (3) to create soil water regime
   maps for non-surveyed catchments. Conversely, soil water regime maps can

Abstract = {{During the summer of 1990, 12 gravity cores were collected in Lake Coeur
   d'Alene, Idaho at various depths and in a variety of depositional
   environments. All core subsamples were analysed to determine the bulk
   sediment chemistry; selected subsamples were analysed for trace element
   partitioning and Cs-137 activity. The purpose of these analyses was to
   determine the trace element concentrations and distributions in the
   sediment column and to try to establish a trace element geochemical
   history of the lake in relation to mining and mining-related discharge
   operations in the area.
   Substantial portions of the near-surface sediments in Lake Coeur d'Alene
   are markedly enriched in Ag, As, Cd, Hg, Pb, Sb and Zn, and slightly
   enriched in Cu, Fe and Mn. Variations in the thickness of the trace
   element-rich sediments, which range from more than 119 cm to as little
   as 17 cm, indicate that the source of much of this material is the Coeur
   d'Alene River. An estimated 75 million tonnes of trace element-rich
   sediments have been deposited on or in the lake bed. Estimated trace
   element masses in excess of those considered representative of
   background conditions range from a high of 468 000 tonnes of Pb to a low
   of 260 tonnes of Hg.
   The similarity between the trace element-rich surface and subsurface
   sediments with respect to their location, their bulk chemistry, their
   interelement relations and their trace element partitioning indicate
   that the sources and/or concentrating mechanisms causing the trace
   element enrichment in the lake sediments have probably been the same
   through-out their depositional history. Based on a Mt St Helens' ash
   layer from the 1980 eruption, ages estimated from Cs-137 activity and
   the presence of 80 discernible and presumably annual layers in a core
   collected near the Coeur d'Alene River delta indicate that deposition
   rates for the trace element-rich sediments have ranges from 2.1 to 1.3
   cm/year. These data also indicate that the deposition of trace
   element-rich sediments began, at least in the Coeur d'Alene River delta,
   some time between 1895 and 1910, dates consistent with the onset of
   mining and ore processing activities that began in the area in the
   1880s.}},

Abstract = {{Selecting the correct resolution in distributed hydrological modelling
   at the watershed scale is essential in reducing scale-related errors.
   The work presented herein uses information content (entropy) to identify
   the resolution which captures the essential variability, at the
   watershed scale, of the infiltration parameters in the Green and Ampt
   infiltration equation. A soil map of the Little Washita watershed in
   south-west Oklahoma, USA was used to investigate the effects of grid
   cell resolution on the distributed modelling of infiltration.
   Soil-derived parameters and infiltration exhibit decreased entropy as
   resolutions become coarser. This is reflected in a decrease in the
   maximum entropy value for the reclassified/derived parameters vis a vis
   the original data. Moreover, the entropy curve, when plotted against
   resolution, shows two distinct segments: a constant section where no
   entropy was lost with decreasing resolution and another part which is
   characterized by a sharp decrease in entropy after a critical resolution
   of 1209 m is reached. This methodology offers a technique for assessing
   the largest cell size that captures the spatial variability of
   infiltration parameters for a particular basin. A geographical
   information system (GIS) based rainfall-runoff model is used to simulate
   storm hydrographs using infiltration parameter maps at different
   resolutions as inputs. Model results up to the critical resolution are
   reproducible and errors are small. However, at resolutions beyond the
   critical resolution the results are erratic with large errors. A major
   finding of this study is that a large resolution (1209 m for this basin)
   yields reproducible model results. When modelling a river basin using a
   distributed model, the resolution (grid cell size) can drastically
   affect the model results and calibration. The error structure
   attributable to grid cell resolution using entropy as a spatial
   variability measure is shown.}},

Abstract = {{The space and time resolutions used for the input variables of a

   results. This resolution depends on the required accuracy, experimental
   site and the processes and variables taken into account in the
   hydrological model. The influence of space and time resolution is
   studied here for the case of TOPMODEL, a model based on the variable
   contributing area concept, applied to an experimental 12 km2 catchment
   (Coet-Dan, Brittany, France) during a two month winter period. A
   sensitivity analysis to space and time resolution is performed first for
   input variables derived from the digital elevation data, secondly for
   the optimized values of the TOPMODEL parameters and finally for
   modelling efficiency. This analysis clearly shows that a relevant domain
   of space and time resolutions where efficiency is fairly constant can be
   defined for the input topographic variables, as opposed to another
   domain of larger resolutions that induces a strong decrease of modelling
   efficiency. It also shows that the use of a single set of parameters,
   defined as mean values of parameters on this relevant domain of
   resolution, does not modify the accuracy of modelling. The sensitivity
   of the parameters to space and time resolution allows the physical
   significance of the parameter values to be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Investigating the transport of suspended solids by water sampling
   usually leads to an underestimation of loads and an unrealistically high
   sampling frequency is required to properly characterize temporal trends.
   An alternative method is to use in situ optical turbidimeters to
   estimate the suspended solids concentration; however, the relationship
   between turbidity and suspended solids concentration is potentially
   confounded by variations in particle size, particle composition and
   water colour. Field measurements, and laboratory measurements using the
   type of natural material suspended in streamwater, were made to quantify
   the influences of these factors on nephelometric turbidity (Hach 2100A)
   and attenuance turbidity (Partech 7000 3RP MKII). The attenuance
   turbidity was approximately 2.5 times higher than nephelometric
   turbidity. The turbidity instruments were most sensitive to dispersions
   with a median diameter of 1.2-1.4 mu m. Particle size variation can
   cause the turbidity to vary by a factor of four for the same
   concentration of suspended solids. However, the numerous close
   correlations between turbidity and suspended solids concentration
   reported previously suggests that either the particle size variations
   are not usually great, or that particle size variations are often
   associated with variations in suspended solids concentration. For the
   same concentration and particle size, organic particles gave attenuance
   turbidity values two to three times higher than mineral particles.
   However, shortterm temporal variations from purely organic to purely
   mineral particle loads are rare in nature, so variations in the
   percentage of organic matter in the particulate load will not confound
   turbidity to this extent. Coloured dissolved organic matter is unlikely
   to alter the turbidity reading by more than 10\%. An adequate
   relationship between turbidity measured in the field and suspended
   solids concentration should be expected in most situations. Some
   variance can be tolerated because a continuous estimate of suspended
   solids concentration overcomes the problem of infrequent sampling, which
   is the greatest source of error in the estimation of stream sediment
   loads.}},

Abstract = {{Geomorphological evidence and recent trash lines were used as stage
   indicators in a step-backwater computer model of high discharges through
   an unguaged bedrock channel.  The simulation indicated that the peak
   discharge from the 26.7 km2 catchment was close to 150 m3 s-1 during the
   passage of Hurricane Charlie in August 1986.  This estimate can be
   compared with an estimate of 130-160 m3 s-1 obtained using the Flood
   Studies Report (FSR) unit hydrograph methodology.  Other palaeostage
   marks indicate that higher stages have occurred at an earlier time
   associated with a discharge of 200 m3 s-1.  However, consideration of
   both the geometry of a plunge pool and transport criteria for bed-rock
   blocks in the channel indicates that floods since 1986 have not exceeded
   150 m3 s-1.  Given that the estimated probable maximum flood (PMF)
   calculated from revised FSR procedure is at least 240 m3 s-1, it is
   concluded that compelling evidence for floods equal to the PMF is

   compared with a return period for the same event in the neighbouring
   gauged River Greta of > 100 years and a rainfall return period of 190
   years.  In as much as discharges of similar order to FSR estimates are
   indicated, it is concluded (a) that regional geomorphological evidence
   and flood simulation within ungauged catchments may be useful as a
   verification for hydrological estimates of recent widespread flood
   magntiude and (b) that palaeohydraulic computation can be useful in
   determining the magnitude of the local maximum `historic' flood when

Abstract = {{A method for collecting suspended sediment samples has been developed
   that pumps a discharge-weighted volume of water from fixed depths at
   four to 40 locations across a river and separates the suspended sediment
   in the sample using a continuous-flow centrifuge.  The efficacy of the
   method is evaluated by comparing the particle size distributions of
   sediment collected by the discharge-weighted pumping method with the
   particle size distributions of sediment collected by depth integration
   and separated by gravitational settling.  The pumping method was found
   to undersample the suspended sand sized particles (> 63 mum) but to
   collect a representative sample of the suspended silt and clay sized
   particles (< 63 mum).  The centrifuge separated the silt and clay sized
   particles (< 63 mum) into three fractions.  Based on the average results
   of processing 17 samples from the Mississippi River and several of its
   large tributaries in 1990, about 10\% of the silt and clay sized
   material was trapped in a centrifuge bowl-bottom sealing unit containing
   the nozzle and consisted of mostly medium and coarse silt from 16 to 63
   mum.  About 74\% was retained on a Teflon liner in the centrifuge bowl
   and consisted of sizes from 0.1 to 63 mum.  About 9\% was discharged
   from the centrifuge in the effluent and was finer than 0.1 mum.  About
   7\% was lost during the processes of removing the wet sediment fractions
   from the centrifuge, drying and weighting.
   The success of the discharge-weighted pumping method depends on how
   homogeneously the silt and clay sized particles (< 63 mum) are
   distributed in the vertical direction in the river.  The degree of
   homogeneity depends on the composition and degree of aggregation of the
   suspended sediment particles.}},

Abstract = {{A field study of surface water and groundwater interactions during
   baseflow and stormflow conditions was performed at the Reedy Creek
   watershed in the Virginia Coastal Plain. Three estimates of the average
   saturated hydraulic conductivity (K(s)) of the unconfined aquifer were
   in reasonable agreement (ranging from 0.0033 to 0.010 cm/s), indicating
   that baseflow in the creek is entirely from the drainage of shallow
   groundwater from the relatively thin (1-6 m thick) unconfined aquifer.
   This relatively permeable surficial aquifer was found to be underlain by
   dark, olive grey, clay-silt and diatomaceous Miocene deposits of low
   permeability known as the Calvert Formation, which is believed to
   function as a confining bed in the area.
   A chemical hydrograph separation technique was used to resolve the
   contributions of `old' (pre-event) and `new' (event) water to stormflow.
   Results from a major rainstorm indicated that old water dominated the
   stormflow response of the watershed, although the new water contribution
   approached 40\% at the hydrograph peak. Stormflow at Reedy Creek appears
   to result from saturation overland flow from variable source areas which
   include the stream channels and a significant part of the riparian
   wetland area. This response appears to be attributable to the transient
   dynamics of the shallow groundwater flow system and to the formation of
   localized groundwater mounds which raise the water-table to the wetland
   surface.}},

Abstract = {{An intensive study was conducted on the biogeochemical processes
   controlling the acid-base chemistry of Reedy Creek, a wetland-influenced
   coastal plain stream located near Ashland, Virginia. In the context of
   the hydrological processes determined by Eshleman et al., the present
   research sought to: (1) identify the sources and sinks of anthropogenic
   and organic acidity within the watershed, (2) determine the seasonal and
   spatial variability in the stream base flow chemistry, (3) determine the
   episodic variability in stream stormflow chemistry and (4) quantify a
   watershed sulphate budget for the 1990 water year. Sulphate is the
   primary acidic anion in groundwater and surface water at the Reedy Creek
   watershed. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and anion deficit data suggest
   that organic acids are less important than sulphate in contributing
   acidity to the stream. In groundwater sampled from wells installed along
   two transects perpendicular to the stream, sulphate concentrations were
   higher and alkalinity lower in the groundwater in the hillslope than in
   the stream. Sulphate concentrations and alkalinity observed in
   groundwater in the wetland were usually between those of the hillslope
   and stream. These data suggest that the wetland is a sink for sulphate
   and acidity; sulphate reduction may be an important mechanism for
   generating alkalinity in the wetland. The DOC concentrations were higher
   in the stream and wetland groundwater than in hillslope groundwater. No
   consistent spatial patterns in sulphate concentrations were observed in
   surface water chemistry under base flow conditions. Anion deficit, DOC
   and the sum of base cation concentrations were usually higher at
   upstream sites than downstream sites. At all sites, sulphate
   concentrations were higher and alkalinity lower in winter and spring
   than during summer and autumn. Calculated anion deficits were lower in
   winter and spring than during summer and autumn, reflecting an increase
   in the contribution of organic acidity during the growing season.
   Seasonality was not observed in DOC concentrations. Stream discharge was
   found to be positively correlated with base flow sulphate concentrations
   and inversely correlated with alkalinity. A sulphate mass balance
   indicated that approximately 30\% of the estimated 24.9 kg SO42-/ha yr
   wet atmospheric input was exported from the watershed as sulphate in
   stream runoff in the water year 1990.}},

Abstract = {{As pumping proceeds in an unconfined aquifer the water-table is lowered

   yield analysis. The one-dimensional unsaturated flow equation was solved
   numerically to simulate the flow in the zone located between successive
   water levels in the unconfined aquifer for the case with zero flux at
   the upper boundary. The moisture content distribution curve was
   integrated numerically to determine the amount of water drained with
   time. The study shows that the numerical results are in close agreement
   with the monitored field data, which implies the important role of the
   unsaturated zone and the reliability of the numerical simulation in

Abstract = {{The ability to continually monitor several meteorological parameters is
   needed to estimate snow surface energy balance components in mountainous
   terrain. In remote mountainous locations, limited accessibility and
   extreme weather conditions limit the use of delicate meteorological
   instrumentation. Robust instrumentation and radio telemetry are often
   needed to measure snow surface energy exchanges. This study examined the
   practicality and effectiveness of robust instrumentation in estimating
   radiative and turbulent exchanges in the forested Bear River Mountains
   of northern Utah. Measurement of reflected shortwave radiation was
   problematic due to possible selective absorption in the infra-red range.
   This resulted in overestimates of reflected shortwave radiation and
   decreased estimates of now surface albedo. During high snowfall, the
   pyranometer and net radiometer were occasionally covered with snow,
   resulting in inaccurate radiation measurements. Snow typically melted
   from instrument surfaces in less than one day under full sun. A relative
   humidity measurement accuracy of +/- 4\% may have resulted in a possible
   error of 20\% in the calculation of vapour pressure. Snow depth
   measurement with an acoustical sensor was affected by new or blowing
   snow, which resulted in inaccurate snow depth measurement 16.2\% of the
   time. The longest period without a valid snow depth measurement was 19.5
   hours. A new snow temperature thermocouple ladder was designed and
   constructed and provided accurate within-pack temperature measurements
   throughout the pre-melt and melt season.}},

   glacio-logical and meteorological data from the area are presented here,
   many of which do not entirely support certain inferences and
   observations made in their paper. It is shown that this very small lake
   is likely to have limited quantitative significance in the operation of
   the glacio-hydrological or solute and sediment transfer systems in this
   basin. Further, specific, difficulties include the absence of crucial
   observations on glacier velocity variations and the precise timing and
   pattern of lake drainage in relation to such velocity changes, the lack
   of evidence for a significant relationship between precipitation receipt
   and ice velocity here {[}a component of the Knight and Tweed (1991)
   proposition], and the occurrence of the lake drainage event in a
   rain-free period (contrary to the authors' suggestion). The opportunity
   is also taken to correct some incidental errors.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was measured at four or eight hour
   intervals between mid-1989 and mid-1991 in two catchments in west
   central Scotland. The experimental catchment had been recently
   clear-felled and the control remained under forest. The amount of DOC
   varied during individual storm events following the stream hydrograph.
   Maximum variations were found in the summer half-year and in the
   clear-felled catchment. There was also evidence of the exhaustion of DOC
   in the later events of a sequence. Differences between the catchments
   were related to catchment characteristics and to land-use change. The
   reduced magnitude of variation in DOC with discharge in the control
   stream was due to the influence of a wetland area through which the
   stream flowed. The mean DOC concentrations were similar in the two
   streams and annual exports were 15 g m-2 from the control and 16 g m-2 
   from the felled catchment. The stream draining the clear-felled
   catchment had greater high flow DOC concentrations in the summer
   half-year, probably due to the effect of greater mean summer
   temperatures on DOC release and of the greater supply of organic debris
   in the stream channel.}},

Abstract = {{Until now, alpine glacial meltwaters have been assumed to consist of two
   components, dilute quickflow and concentrated delayed flow, the, mixing
   of which has been regarded as chemically conservative for the major
   dissolved ions and electrical conductivity. Dye tracing results suggest
   that this two-component model adequately represents the subglacial
   hydrology of the Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland. However, laboratory
   dissolution experiments in which various concentrations of glacial rock
   flour are placed in dilute solutions show that this rock flour is highly
   reactive and suggest that bulk meltwaters may acquire significant
   amounts of solute through rapid chemical reactions with suspended
   sediment which occur after mixing of the two components. This view is
   supported by detailed analysis of variations in the hydrochemistry of
   meltwaters draining from the Haut Glacier d'Arolla over three diurnal
   cycles during the 1989 melt season. Variations in the composition of
   bulk meltwaters are controlled by two main factors: dilution of the
   delayed flow component by quickflow, and the extent of post-mixing
   reactions. The latter depends on the suspended sediment concentration in
   bulk meltwaters and on the duration of contact between these waters and
   suspended sediment. Seasonal changes in the magnitude of these factors
   result in changes in the character and causes of diurnal variations in
   meltwater chemistry. In June, these variations reflect discharge-related
   variations in residence time within a distributed subglacial drainage
   system; in July, when a channelized drainage system exists beneath the
   lower glacier, they primarily reflect the dilution of delayed flow by
   quickflow; in August, when suspended sediment concentrations are
   particularly high, they reflect varying degrees of solute acquisition by
   post-mixing reactions with suspended sediment that take place in
   arterial channels at the glacier bed.}},

Abstract = {{Major-ion variability related to discharge was analysed in a forested
   187 km2 mafic Piedmont Province watershed using statistical (both
   parametric and non-parametric), graphical (box-plots) and curve-fitting
   (log concentration-log discharge) techniques. Baseflow alkalinity and
   base cation concentrations show systematic temporal variations as a
   result of the influx of additional water that occurs during the late
   autumn to early spring. Regression analyses indicate that storm-related
   discharge and baseflow generated during periods of water surplus are
   characterized by similar dilution slopes. Mass balance estimates
   indicate that the additional water, which comprises storm/recession
   discharge and baseflow from late autumn to early spring, is between
   about 30 and 80\% as concentrated as summer low-flow.
   The thick clay-rich soil mantle represents a key control on solute
   concentrations in that it stores water for periods of time sufficient
   for a high degree of water-mineral interaction to occur. Hence
   solute-discharge relationships (C = aQ(b), where b is typically < 0) are
   characterized by relatively low slope values and there is ample acid
   neutralizing capacity throughout the range of discharge. Owing to the
   predominance of amphibolite, solute efflux related to rock weathering
   from the Falling Creek watershed is much greater than other more felsic
   locations within the region. Statistical analyses (t-test and the
   non-parametric Mann-whitney-Wilcoxon test), along with accompanying
   box-plot representations, provide a useful method of describing
   systematic annual hydrochemical variation within streamflow. These
   methods are particularly effective for those instances in which a
   long-term data set exists, but is limited to relatively few sampling
   periods per year.}},

Abstract = {{Eight small steep south-west facing catchments (1-63-8.26 ha) have been

   various harvesting and land preparation techniques before being planted
   with Pinus radiata between 1977 and 1980. Stream temperatures were
   measured in all catchments for 11 years, including up to four years
   before harvesting.
   The streamwater temperature regime under the native forest cover has a
   seasonal cycle, with an annual mean of about 9-degrees-C and mean daily
   temperatures ranging between a winter minimum of about 5-8-degrees-C and
   a summer maximum of 12.5-degrees-C. After harvesting, the winter minimum
   stream temperatures in all trials were unchanged as topography exerts
   the major control over incoming solar radiation. The largest rises in
   mean summer stream temperatures, up to 5.5-degrees-C, were in the
   catchments that had been clearcut and burnt before planting. The maximum
   stream temperature recorded was 22.8-degrees-C in a clearcut catchment
   with no riparian reserve. Summer stream temperatures in this catchment
   were up to 11-degrees-C higher than in an adjacent control catchment.
   Summer stream temperature rises in catchments with riparian reserves
   were less than 1.5-degrees-C.
   Seven years after harvesting, stream temperatures were dropping towards
   pre-treatments levels in only two of the six treated catchments as
   revegetation of the riparian areas occurred and the plantations became
   established.
   As these small headwater streams discharge into streams with flows one
   or two orders of magnitude larger, the increases in summer stream
   temperatures will be rapidly dissipated. However, the cumulative impact
   of harvesting many small headwater catchments that discharge into a
   larger stream could have a noticeable effect on stream temperature if
   intact riparian reserves were not retained in both headwater and main
   streams.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrometric and isotopic (oxygen-18) observations were used to delineate
   the runoff processes operating in several headwater catchments on the
   Precambrian Shield of Canada. The catchments comprise patches of conifer
   forest situated on thin soils among areas of lichen-covered granitic
   bedrock. Horton overland flow occurred from the lichen-bedrock areas in
   all precipitation events that exceeded 4- 6 mm. Runoff from the forest
   stands occurred mainly as subsurface stormflow, but in some instances
   saturation overland flow was observed. The occurrence of saturation
   overland flow was controlled by the topography of the bedrock beneath
   the forest soils. The area contributing runoff and the pathway by which
   water was conveyed to the catchment outflow switched from the open
   lichen-bedrock areas producing overland flow on the rising limb of the
   storm hydrograph to the forest stands contributing subsurface stormflow
   on the recession limb of the hydrograph. The areal extent and position
   of the landscape units in the basin were important to the rate and
   magnitude of stormflow production. Runoff was generated from the
   catchments only during and immediately after snowmelt and/or rainfall
   events. The catchments were dry and/or frozen for about 70\% of the
   year.}},

Abstract = {{Streamwater chemistry was monitored for five years in six streams in a
   paired catchment experiment in Mendolong, Sabah, Malaysia, including
   controls in rain forest and secondary vegetation after the `Borneo fire'
   of 1982-3 and comparing the effects of different ways of establishing
   forest plantations with Acacia mangium. Three catchments were covered
   with selectively logged lowland hill dipterocarp forest (W4-W6) and
   three (W1-W3) with secondary vegetation after forest fires. The control
   catchments, W3 and W6 reported in this paper, had no treatments applied.
   Reference monitoring at all streams was for 25 months and the total
   period of study reported here is 64 months. The soils in the catchments
   were mainly Orthic Acrisol in W3 and Gleyic Podsol in W6 and a mix of
   both soil types in the other catchments.
   Element baseflow concentrations were generally low and not significantly
   different from stormflow concentrations for all streams during the
   reference period. Concentrations were also generally consistently low
   for the two control streams during the whole period of measurement.
   Chemical inputs as wet deposition were low as a result of a high input
   from local convection.
   The rain forest on the Podsol had a tight nutrient circulation indicated
   by small net losses of macronutrients. The Podsol was found to have
   poorer conditions for soil mineralization and more surficial runoff,
   resulting in higher loads of S, C and N in the organic phases, with
   higher organic C/N ratio, in the discharge. Nitrogen was found to
   accumulate in both catchments. An almost double accumulation of N in W3
   was attributed to a larger biomass accumulation continuing after the
   forest fire 3-8 years earlier. On the other hand, the Acrisol in W3 had
   much larger net losses of S, Si, K, Ca, Mg and Na. Most of differences
   could be attributed to differences in weathering between the soils and
   local mineralogical differences.}},

Abstract = {{Streamwater chemistry was monitored for five years in six streams in a
   paired catchment experiment in Mendolong, Sabah, Malaysia, comparing the
   effects of different ways to establish forest plantations with Acacia
   mangium. At the start of the monitoring in 1985 three catchments were
   covered with selectively logged rain forest (W4- W6) and three with
   secondary vegetation after forest fire (W1-W3). The treatments were: (1)
   clearing of secondary vegetation, burning and planting (W1 and W2); (2)
   clear-felling, crawler tractor extraction, burning and planting (W5);
   and (3) clear-felling, manual extraction, no burning and planting (W4).
   W3 and W6, with no treatment, were monitored as control catchments.
   Reference monitoring at all streams was for two years and was followed
   by treatments which lasted for nine months before the full establishment
   of a new vegetation cover. This paper covers monitoring for a further
   2.5 years. The soil types of the catchments were Orthic Acrisol in W3,
   Gleyic Podsol in W6 and a mix of both soil types in the other
   catchments.
   The effect of treatments on streamwater chemistry was clear at both
   base- and stormflows. Concentrations of major plant nutrients (N, P and
   K) became positively correlated to streamflow during treatments. The
   response of leaching from slash at clear-felling was fast and larger
   from the clear-felling residues (W4 and W5) than the cleared secondary
   vegetation (W1 and W2). The intense response to burning was more marked.
   The stormflow period mean nutrient concentrations were approximately
   10-fold for N and K and 10 - 100 fold for P after burning compared with
   baseflow mean concentrations over the same period. Significant
   differences in baseflow concentrations in treated streams generally
   lasted one year for most elements, but elevated concentrations were
   still detectable after three years. The first large pulse of leaching
   was related to mineralization after tree-felling and particularly
   burning. The longer lasting elevated concentrations in baseflow were
   associated with the loss of weathering products.
   The amounts of nutrients lost, calculated by regression analysis as the
   effect of treatment compared with control, were found to be higher with
   the degree of vegetation killed and with increased soil disturbance.
   Consequently, normal forestry practices, with crawler tractor extraction
   and burning before planting, created the largest leaching losses. The
   total calculated effect of losses in total N, P and K were (i) W1 + W2
   0.5, 1.8, 83-9; (ii) W4 0.8, 0-8, 105.6; and (iii) W5 1.3, 1.3, 189-4 kg
   ha-1 for the period of 33 months during and after treatment. With normal
   forestry practice using crawler tractors and with burning before
   planting (W5), the treatment-induced loss of K was equivalent to 86\% of
   the content of easily decomposed parts of the biomass (leaves, twigs,
   fine roots and ground vegetation) of the old forest, or larger than K
   removed by harvest. Exhaustion effects of lowered leaching after
   repeated burning (forest fire and pre-planting fire) was observed for
   several elements, indicating possible nutrient deficiencies.}},

   collected from the hydrometeorological station at Solapur. These two
   hydrometeorological parameters, along with the local agroclimatological
   conditions and soil characteristics of the area have been used to
   estimate surface runoff and groundwater recharge in the water balance
   model. Interception loss from the canopy cover has been assumed as 0.2
   mm per rainfall event. The surface runoff has been calculated using the
   Soil Conservation Service runoff curve number model. A representative
   curve number has been selected based on vegetation, land use and
   agricultural practices. Evapotranspiration coefficients of the general
   crops grown in the area, i.e. maize, millet, sorghum etc., have been

Abstract = {{The spatial variability of each parameter affecting storm runoff must be
   accounted for in distributed modelling. The objective of the work
   reported here is to assess the effects of using distributed versus
   lumped hydraulic roughness coefficients in the modelling of direct
   surface runoff. A spatially variable data set composed of Manning
   roughness coefficients is used to model direct surface runoff. To assess
   the information content (as measured by entropy) of spatially variable
   data and its significance in distributed modelling, various degrees of
   smoothing are applied. The error resulting from smoothing the hydraulic
   roughness coefficients is determined by modelling overland flow using a
   finite element solution. The Manning roughness coefficients were taken
   from field measurements of the Manning roughness coefficient at 0.6 m on
   a 14 m hillslope. These values were then used in a numerical simulation
   of outflow hydrographs to investigate the dependence of error on spatial
   variability. Our study focuses on the characteristics of spatial data
   used in distributed hydrological modelling.
   The field sites have fractal dimensions of almost-equal-to 1.4, which is
   close to a Brownian variation. The sampling interval that captures the
   essential spatial variability of the Manning roughness coefficient does
   not seem to matter due to its Brownian variation in the field sites.
   Hence due to the nearly uniform random distribution, measurements at 0.6
   m intervals are not necessary and larger intervals would yield results
   that are just as acceptable provided the mean value together with a
   uniformly random distribution is maintained for any size of finite
   element or sampling resolution. Because detailed measurements of
   hydraulic roughness are not practically available for deterministic
   catchment modelling, it is important to know that larger sampling
   resolutions may be used than 0.6 m.}},

Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Cooper Creek is characterized by an exceptionally wide floodplain and a
   complex system of anastomosing channels which together can accommodate a
   large range of highly variable flows. In consequence flood frequency
   curves are unusually steep. With minimal tributary contribution over the
   two study lengths - Currareva-Nappa Merrie (> 400 km) and Nappa
   Merrie-Innamincka (32 km) - downstream output is largely controlled by
   upstream input, so that similar flow regimes and hydrograph forms can be
   maintained despite transmission losses and the variable activation of
   channels.
   Input-output relationships defined in terms of total flow volume and
   peak discharge suggest that, above a threshold flow of about 25\%
   duration, transmission losses exceed 75\% on average over the
   Currareva-Nappa Merrie length. The large difference in absorption
   between primary channels on the one hand and subsidiary channels and the
   floodplain surface on the other means that transmission losses vary
   non-linearly with stage. They are relatively low when flow is confined
   to the primary channels, but increase at higher stages as lesser
   channels and the floodplain are activated. Early levels do not recur
   until flows of < 0.5\% duration are attained when output/input ratios
   increase rapidly with discharge. The influences of seasonality and
   background flow on output discharge are small relative to that of input
   discharge.
   Despite the long river distance, peak flows at Currareva and Nappa
   Merrie are well correlated. However, over the shorter Nappa
   Merrie-Innamincka length with its more confined system of channels,
   correlations are better and transmission losses less. They vary from
   60\% just above the threshold discharge to < 10\% at flows below 20\%
   duration. Over this length outflow hydrographs can be effectively
   estimated by the three parameter Muskingum procedure, at least on an
   event by event basis, but further application must await additional
   records to understand fully how the parameters vary in an environment
   where streamflow is transmitted through a highly variable system of
   channels.}},

Abstract = {{The ionic tracers lithium, sodium, chloride and bromide were used to
   measure flow loss in a small stream (almost-equal-to 10 1 s-1). An
   injectate containing all four tracers was added continuously at five
   sites along a 507 m study reach of St Kevin Gulch, Lake County, Colorado
   to determine which sections of the stream were losing water to the
   stream bed and to ascertain how well the four tracers performed. The
   acidity of the stream (pH 3.6) made it possible for lithium and sodium,
   which are normally adsorbed by ion exchange with stream bed sediment, to
   be used as conservative tracers. Net flow losses as low as 0.81 s-1, or
   8\% of flow, were calculated between measuring sites. By comparing the
   results of simultaneous injection it was determined whether subsections
   of the study reach were influent or effluent. Evaluation of tracer
   concentrations along 116 m of stream indicated that all four tracers
   behaved conservatively. Discharges measured by Parshall flumes were
   4-18\% greater than discharges measured by tracer dilution.}},

Abstract = {{A hierarchical sampling programme (including continuous monitoring,
   twice-daily sampling and sampling at hourly intervals over selected 24
   hour periods) was devised to support   hydrochemical and hydrological
   research programmes on an alpine proglacial stream. The rationale for
   the research and for the sampling programme are explained and the
   hydrochemical time series generated over an ablation season are analysed
   to assess the degree to which they support the study aims. It appears
   that there is no satisfactory substitute for the chemical analysis of at
   least two water samples taken at approximately maximum and minimum
   discharge every day, if seasonal variations in meltwater chemistry are
   to be effectively characterized. Such time series data can be used to
   estimate Box-Jenkins transfer function-noise models between particular
   solutes (SO42-, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and possibly K+) and either discharge or
   electrical conductivity, which can then be used to fill any short gaps
   in the data. This approach is not satisfactory even for filling short
   gaps in the twice-daily determinations of pH, HCO3- and NO3-. At the
   diurnal time-scale (based on hourly determinations over 24 hour periods)
   electrical conductivity seems to provide a good surrogate for most of
   the solutes studied. HCO3-,SO42-, Ca2+ and Mg2+ were found to be
   particularly strongly related to electrical conductivity and there was
   little if any significant serial autocorrelation in the residuals from
   all of the simple linear regression relationships that were estimated
   between individual species and conductivity. It is concluded that the
   hierarchical sampling design was suitable for the purposes of the study,
   and that the continuous monitoring of electrical conductivity provides
   excellent supporting information to the chemical analysis of water
   samples if it is used carefully as a means of short term calibration and
   interpolation of the solute record.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamic models of overland flow and channel flow are based on the
   shallow water wave theory described by the St Venant (SV) equations.
   These models are derived from either the kinematic wave (KW)
   approximation, the diffusion wave approximation (DW), or the dynamic
   wave (DYW) representation of the SV equations. In studies reported to
   date, different criteria have been established to evaluate the adequacy
   of the KW and DW approximations, but no explicit relations either in
   time or in space between these criteria and the errors resulting from
   these approximations have yet been derived. Furthermore, when carrying
   out hydrological modelling, it is not evident if the KW and the DW
   approximations are valid for the entire hydrograph or a portion thereof.
   In other words, these criteria take on fixed point values for a given
   rainfall-runoff event. This paper attempts to derive, under simplified
   conditions, error equations for the KW or DW approximations for space
   independent flows, which provide a continuous description of error in
   the flow discharge hydrograph. The KW, DW and DYW solutions are
   parameterized through a dimensionless parameter gamma which reflects the
   effect of the initial depth of flow, channel bed slope, lateral inflow
   and channel roughness. By comparing the kinematic wave and diffusion
   wave solutions with the dynamic wave solution, equations are derived in
   terms of gamma for the error in the kinematic wave and diffusion wave
   approximations. The error equations turn out to be the Riccati equation.}},

   Seep emergence is associated with downslope drainage and local

Abstract = {{Time sequences of tracer release from an alpine snowpack were
   investigated at Mammoth Mountain, California in 1989. Lysimeter
   discharge and conductivity were recorded at 30 minute intervals. Three
   separate applications of chemical tracers were added to the snow surface
   to provide an ionic signal with known origins in the snowpack. Grab
   samples of meltwater and snow from snow pits were analysed for chemical
   composition. There were three distinct discharge periods, each
   characterized by diurnal fluctuations in discharge and conductivity. An
   inverse relation between discharge and conductivity was interpreted as
   the combination of a concentrated signal from regions in the pack less
   subject to leaching and a relatively dilute signal from near the snow
   surface where the snow was actively melting Conductivity peaks were
   highest and diurnal changes greatest immediately following periods of
   freezing. Grab samples showed little correlation with either 30 minute
   or daily average conductivity. Relative concentrations of individual
   ions in meltwater were similar between samples. Non-systematic grab
   sampling of snowpack meltwater is shown to be potentially misleading
   because of multiple ionic pulses over the ablation season and strong
   diurnal fluctuations in chemical concentrations. Continuous measurements
   of discharge conductivity are a good indicator of diurnal and seasonal
   changes in the rate of ion release from the snowpack, and should be used
   to guide sampling. Composite, or time-integrated samples rather than
   grab samples may be required to estimate daily and weekly rates of ion
   release in melting snow.}},

Abstract = {{During the summer of 1989 surface sediment samples were collected in
   Lake Coeur d'Alene, the Coeur d'Alene River and the St Joe River, Idaho,
   at a density of approximately one sample per square kilometre.
   Additional samples were collected from the banks of the South Fork of
   the Coeur d'Alene and the Coeur d'Alene Rivers in 1991.  All the samples
   were collected to determine trace element concentrations, partitioning
   and distribution patterns, and to relate them to mining, mining related
   and discharge operations that have occurred in the Coeur d'Alene
   district since the 1880s, some of which are ongoing.
   Most of the surface sediments in Lake Coeur d'Alene north of Conkling
   Point and Carey Bay are substantially enriched in Ag, As, Cu, Cd, Hg,
   Pb, Sb and Zn relative to unaffected sediments in the southern portion
   of the lake near the St Joe River. All the trace element enriched
   sediments are extremely fine grained (mean grain sizes much less than 63
   mum). Most of the enriched trace elements, based on both the chemical
   analyses of separated heavy and light mineral fractions and a two step
   sequential extraction procedure, are associated with an operationally
   defined Fe oxide phase; much smaller percentages are associated either
   with operationally defined organics/sulphides or refractory phases.
   The presence, concentration and distribution of the Fe oxides and heavy
   minerals indicates that a substantial portion of the enriched trace
   elements are probably coming from the Coeur d'Alene River, which is
   serving as a point source. Within the lake, this relatively simple point
   source pattern is complicated by a combination of (1) the formation of
   trace element rich authigenic Fe oxides that appear to have
   reprecipitated from material solubilized from anoxic bed sediments and
   (2) physical remobilization by currents and wind driven waves. The
   processes that have caused the trace element enrichment in the surface
   sediments of Lake Coeur d'Alene are likely to continue for the
   foreseeable future.}},

Abstract = {{For many years hydrologists have tried to build physically realistic
   models which are still simple enough to be fitted to a range of
   observations made in the field. This is an ongoing process which will
   become even more difficult as the quality and variety of field and
   remotely sensed data improves. Hence models must be able to predict soil
   moisture patterns in time and in space as well as the outflow
   hydrograph. The model presented here (TOPMODEL) aims to predict the
   nature of variable source areas in a way that reflects their dynamics
   over space and time. All component processes are described and shown in
   operation. As TOPMODEL and similar models have a growing popularity,
   this paper can be seen as a demonstration of the model's predictive
   capabilities. The model is applied to the catchments of Plynlimon,
   mid-Wales for 1984, 1985 and 1986 data sets. The model has been
   thoroughly tested and cross-validated against independent data sets for
   different time periods, for a separate catchment, for internal gauges
   and for wet and dry periods. The resulting predicted soil moisture
   patterns show a small, semi-permanent variable source area that has the
   ability during large storms to expand dynamically over short time
   periods. Spatial predictions of evapotranspiration are also shown which
   reflect the influence of soil moisture patterns on this process. The
   weakest component of the model is the representation of root zone
   evaporation and how this pre-sets the antecedent condition of the
   catchment during long dry periods.}},

Abstract = {{Solute leaching in unsaturated soil is influenced by the variability in
   hydraulic functions (water retention and conductivity) that govern the
   flow process. Variability in measured soil hydraulic functions of a
   coarse-, medium- and fine-textured soil group was quantified with the
   scaling theory of similar media. Solute leaching in these soils was
   calculated with Monte Carlo simulation assuming, successively, hydraulic
   conductivity, K, volumetric water content, theta, and pressure head, h,
   to be constant. In addition to variability in hydraulic functions,
   variability in the solute retardation factor was also taken into
   account. To examine this effect five solutes were considered: a
   conservative solute (chloride), a non-retarded solute subject to decay
   (nitrate), a retarded solute that does not decay (cadmium) and two
   organic solutes which are retarded but have different sorption and decay
   parameters (the pesticide atrazine and a chlorinated hydrocarbon). The
   numerical results obtained with Monte Carlo simulation were in a number
   of instances verified with analytical solutions. The three soil groups
   distinguished showed considerable differences in vulnerability for
   leaching of the five solutes, emphasizing the importance of the effect
   of variability in soil hydraulic functions when studying solute
   leaching. Numerical and analytical results showed good agreement.
   Therefore, in relatively simple situations analytical solutions are
   attractive. However, in complicated situations, analytical solutions are
   cumbersome and numerical solutions are the only realistic alternative.}},

Abstract = {{Particulate matter suspended in the River Severn (Shropshire, UK)
   consists chiefly of clay-sized mineral particles, together with living
   and dead micro-organisms (algae and bacteria). Its concentration depends
   strongly on discharge, but the particle size distribution shows no
   systematic variability. For most samples, the particle volume is
   log-normally distributed with respect to diameter, the mean diameter
   being ca. 9 mum. The particles are mainly aggregates, including some
   with linear dimensions of the order of tens or hundreds of micrometres.
   Particle density depends appreciably on size, decreasing from ca. 2.5 x
   10(6) g m-3 at a diameter of 2.5 mum to ca. 1.3 x 10(6) g m-3 at 20 mum.
   The collision efficiency factor for particle aggregation is estimated to
   be 0.01-0.03. At low discharge, the `dead zone' in the River Severn at
   Leighton is a well defined region of stagnant water behind a gravel bar.
   The rate of deposition of fine particles on its bed is of the order of
   tens of grams per square metre per day. Resuspension requires a critical
   bed shear velocity of 0.03-0.04 m s-1, which occurs at main river
   discharges greater than about 150 m3 s-1. Under such conditions the
   gravel bar is underwater and the dead zone is a region of highly
   turbulent return flow. A simple mechanistic model of particle dynamics
   in the dead zone accounts reasonably well for particle accumulation
   rates when run with parameter values based on measured particle and
   hydraulic properties. Calculations with the model suggest that most of
   the sedimentation flux to the dead zone bed is due to particles with
   equivalent sphere diameters in the range 30-240 mum. Simulations
   indicate that deposition proceeded continuously during spring and
   summer, whereas repeated deposition and resuspension occurred in autumn
   and winter.}},

Abstract = {{The different depth penetration characteristics of Cs-137, Be-7 and
   Pb-210 excess in undisturbed soils can be used to identify erosion
   processes by analysis of sediments derived from surface erosion.
   Caesium-137 concentrations (half-life 30 years) typically decrease to
   half the surface value at between 30 and 50 mm. Beryllium-7 (half-life
   53 days) has half-penetration depths of between 0.7 and 10 mm, whereas
   Pb-210 excess (half-life 20.2 years) has half-penetration depths between
   10 and 30 mm. Experiments designed to determine the applicability of
   these depth penetration characteristics to soil erosion studies are
   reported. Surface runoff was artificially generated at two locations in
   a grazed paddock using a rainfall simulator. Suspended sediment was
   extracted from runoff and analysed for natural and artificial gamma
   emitting radionuclides. Suspended sediment derived from sheet flow
   contained initially high values of Cs-137, Be-7 and Pb-210 excess. As
   the experiment continued Cs-137 concentrations remained high, but Be-7
   and Pb-210 excess value decreased with time. This is interpreted as
   indicating a change from sheet dominated erosion to rill dominated
   erosion. During a second experiment artificial rain was allowed to fall
   onto an eroded gully wall. The derived suspended sediment contained no
   detectable Cs-137, Be-7 or Pb-210 excess. Overland flow from above the
   gully wall was then allowed to run down the gully face and mix with the
   water falling directly onto the gully wall. There was no detectable
   change in the radionuclide signature, showing that the gully wall was
   the predominant source of sediment. This was tested independently by
   mass balance and Ra-226 to Th-232 ratios. The good correlation between
   Pb-210 excess and Be-7 at this site suggests that the differential
   technique described here may be applicable over time-scales longer than
   are possible with Be-7. It may therefore be practical to examine
   catchment erosion history through analysis of Pb-210 excess and Cs-137
   in sediment cores.}},

Abstract = {{A combination of hydrometric data and observations of natural isotope
   (oxygen- 1 8) variations in saturation over an flow and stream discharge
   were used to investigate the sources of storm run-off in a headwater
   swamp located in a permanent groundwater discharge zone near Toronto,
   Canada. The results of a two-component hydrograph separation indicated
   that pre-event water formed 80-90\% of the stream hydrograph volume for
   six of the seven storms analyzed in June-November 1990. However, the
   instantaneous event water contribution showed considerable variability,
   ranging from maximum values of 20-25\% for four moderate intensity
   storms to 63\% for a high intensity thunderstorm with a return period of
   two years. The relative contribution of event and pre-event water to
   storm run-off from saturated areas and small streamlets within the swamp
   was similar to the main outlet stream. The dominance of pre-event water
   during storms could be accounted for by the mixing of a small volume of
   event water with a large pool of pre-event water on the surface of
   permanently saturated areas within the swamp. Occasional storms of high
   intensity or long duration produced a greater shift towards an event
   water signature in the saturated areas and a larger event water
   contribution to the outlet stream hydrograph.}},

Abstract = {{Erosion of soil from pre-afforestation plough furrows has been measured
   on four soil types in Scotland for 12 to 18 month periods between 1987
   and 1990. Rainfall-run-off was also measured at one site. Run-off is
   directly proportional to furrow length and rainfall intensity, and for a
   wide range of intensities (typically > 6 mm hr-1) a small amount of soil
   is flushed out of the furrows. However, for furrow,spacings of 3.8 m, a
   critical downslope run-off increment associated with significant soil
   loss is of the order of 25 cm3 s-1 m-1, which is in accord with a storm
   of five years return period and a maximum intensity of 25 mm hr-1. The
   total run-off volume for any hydrograph is commensurate with the total
   rainfall in the rainstorm - typically 40-80\% by the hydrograph peak and
   approaching 100\% by the end of the hydrograph; i.e. long term storage
   is negligible. A positive relationship was recorded between furrow
   length, slope angle and sediment yield, with deposition predominating in
   furrows less than 30 m in length on slopes less than a few degrees. Soil
   loss is proportional to the excess streampower expended by the run-off
   with an exponent in the range 1 - 1.5. For the soils examined,
   significant differences in soil loss when comparing sites for low power
   expenditure become undifferentiated at high power expenditures. For the
   rainfall regimes monitored, maximum soil losses were in the region of 40
   kg per meter run-length of furrow, when soil peds were ripped from the
   bed. Laboratory data concerning the critical erosion threshold power and
   shear stress to erode soil peds are in general accord with the threshold
   furrow run-lengths defined using the field data for a five year storm
   and the soil losses observed.}},

Abstract = {{In the last 20 years remote sensing research has led to significant
   progress in monitoring and measuring certain snow hydrology processes.
   Snow distribution in a drainage basin can be adequately assessed by
   visible sensors. Although there are still some interpretation problems,
   the NOAA-AVHRR sensor can provide frequent views of the areal snow cover
   in a basin, and snow cover maps are produced operationally by the
   National Weather Service on about 3000 drainage basins in North America.
   Measurement of snow accumulation or snow water equivalent with microwave
   remote sensing has great potential because of the capabilities for depth
   penetration, all-weather observation and night-time viewing. Several
   critical areas of research remain, namely, the acquisition of snow grain
   size information for input to microwave models and improvement in
   passive microwave resolution from space. Methods that combine both
   airborne gamma ray and visible satellite remote sensing of the snowpack
   with field measurements also hold promise for determining areal snow
   water equivalent. Some remote sensing techniques can also be used to
   detect different stages of snow metamorphism. Various aspects of
   snowpack ripening can be detected using microwave and thermal infra-red
   capabilities. The capabilities for measurement of snow albedo and
   surface temperature have direct application in both snow metamorphism
   and snowpack energy balance studies. The potentially most profitable
   research area here is the study of the bidirectional reflectance
   distribution function to improve snow albedo measurements. Most of the
   remote sensing capabilities in snow hydrology have been developed for
   improving snowmelt-run-off forecasting. Most applications have used the
   input of snow cover extent to deterministic models, both of the degree
   day and energy balance types. Snowmelt-run-off forecasts using satellite
   derived snow cover depletion curves and the models have been
   successfully made. As the extraction of additional snow cover
   characteristics becomes possible, remote sensing will have an even
   greater impact on snow hydrology. Important remote sensing capabilities
   will become available in the next 20 years through space platform
   observing systems that will improve our capability to observe the
   snowpack on an operational basis.}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing technology has matured significantly over the past
   decade. Operational satellites provide reliable, periodic coverage for
   all areas of the Earth. Data from these satellites are in a digital
   format that provides enhanced flexibility in hydrological modelling.
   Considerable advances in acquiring hydrological data from airborne and
   in situ sensors have also been achieved. Additionally, data from
   non-traditional remote sources such as weather radar from which spatial
   and temporal rainfall rates may be estimated are widely available. These
   new data acquisition capabilities have been paralleled by equal
   advancements in digital array processing and geographic information
   systems, which allow the effective extraction of both temporal and
   spatial information. This paper examines the use of object-oriented
   programming techniques to create dynamic hydrological models, and
   explores their potential to receive real and near real-time data from
   remote sensors as input to improve hydrological forecasting. In
   particular, the COE SSARR model is used to illustrate how an established

Abstract = {{The Breton bocage is a landscape of fields enclosed by a network of
   hedgerow banks and ditches. Organization of this bocage varies
   considerably in different areas of Brittany. However, one constant
   feature of the different bocage landscapes is the presence of banks
   enclosing bottom lands, which enclose elongated plots in the thalweg
   bottoms. The banks enclosing the bottom lands influence the sensitivity
   of the basin to surface run-off and also the presence of excess surface
   water zones. To analyse the part played by banks enclosing bottom lands,
   the topography of a typical first order basin was modelled and the
   existence of such a bank within the catchment was simulated. The effect
   of the bank on the Kirkby index, a topographical parameter defining the
   sensitivity of soils to surface run-off was analysed. Modification of
   its spatial distribution is considerable for mean values of the index.
   The saturation zone, the storm run-off source area, is reduced to that
   area of bottom land enclosed by the bank; it thus varies very little so
   that run-off conditions are almost constant whatever the climatic
   conditions. From the methodological point of view, the interest of
   analysing the spatial distribution of morphometric parameters of a
   catchment may be noted; in the example studied, the heterogeneity of the
   Kirkby index distribution is an important factor in the analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Samples of snowpack leachate were collected over a 60 day period of the
   spring melt season in 1988 and 1989 at a 10 km2 upland catchment in the
   Cairngorm mountains of Scotland. These were analysed for major ions to
   assess snowpack chemistry dynamics through the spring and to assess the
   melt water influence on stream water chemistry. The data clearly show
   preferential elution of sulphate and nitrate over chloride and hydrogen
   over the other cations during the early melt of 1988. Following the
   addition of ions to the snow surface, either as snow or later in the
   season as rain, the elution sequence is reproduced. Comparison of
   leachate chemistry with stream chemistry samples taken at the basin
   outlet indicate that snow pack melt water contributes directly to stream
   water. The stream water chemistry signal is, however, noisy and the
   stream concentrations are considerably damped relative to the snowpack
   leachate. This is thought to be a consequence of differential melting
   within the catchment as the snowpack at lower altitudes is at a more
   advanced stage of melt and so holds fewer solutes and mixing with
   groundwater contributions. Temperature observations at different
   altitudes within the catchment support this interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{The uncertainty in a transducer/tensiometer system was assessed with
   temperature and pressure calibrations. A reference
   transducer/tensiometer pair was used to factor out temperature related
   deviations from two monitoring pairs. The reference pair removed most of
   the deviations, resulting in a high estimate of precision. In contrast
   to earlier reports of high accuracy, these estimates of accuracy were
   considerably reduced by a time correlated residual pattern. The
   calibrations suggested that the electronic components may be responsible
   for these residual errors and illustrated the need for experimentation
   which isolates the error among groups of components. The complexity of
   transducer/tensiometer networks, and the differing response of each
   component to thermal loading, demonstrated the necessity of using a
   reference system, which when properly designed can yield reliable
   pressure readings for soil water.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the spatial and temporal variations of runoff,
   erosion and rate of sediment transport on an agricultural field
   submitted to natural rainfalls. The site, located in the Eastern
   Townships (Quebec, Canada), is a corn field (10000 m2) where sheetwash
   erosion is active. Water (Q) and sediment (Qs) discharges were measured
   from June to October at eight locations on the field and for ten
   rainfall events. Analysis of the data was carried out on an aggregate
   data set and on the distributed measurements in time and space. The
   results showed that changes in vegetation, soil compaction and crusting
   are critical in determining temporal variations of runoff and erosion.
   Until August, the increase in soil compaction reduced infiltration
   capacity and depression storage and generated greater runoff for a given
   rainfall intensity (I). Sediment transport decreased as particle
   detachment is less likely to occur when vegetation breaks the drop
   impact and the soil surface is sealed. Later in the season, we observed
   an increase in sediment concentration associated with the presence of
   burrowing insects and harvest activity, providing loose sediments to the
   broken down surface. Intercepts and slopes of the relationship between Q
   and Qs also vary during the period of measurement. High sediment
   availability over the soil surface in June and October gives high
   intercept values. The slope of the relationship is more stable but
   difficult to estimate for extreme events (high values of I or low Q
   values) where the number of sampled points are small. During a rainfall,
   the response of the field is dominated by the topography and drainage
   area. The largest amount of runoff and erosion occurred on straight and
   steep slopes with small drainage areas, and on converging gentle slopes
   with large drainage areas. Although aggregate runoff and erosion values
   are decreasing with drainage area, parameters of the Qs-Q relationship
   for different locations on the field are not statistically different.
   These results bear important consequences for models of sheetwash
   erosion on agricultural fields.}},

Abstract = {{Water temperature behaviour in a small upland Exmoor catchment (the

   temperatures to have a coefficient of variation of less than 5 per cent,
   and values of 5, 10 and 15-degrees-C to be equalled or exceeded 90, 41.8
   and 4 per cent of the time respectively. The annual regime of water
   temperature was relatively predictable but diel cycles of varying
   magnitude were superimposed on the seasonal march. A clear seasonal
   hysteresis was evident whereby diel range in spring exceeded that in
   autumn by typically more than 2-degrees-C. Trend analysis of monthly
   temperature time series highlighted the stability of the thermal regime
   in recent years, although investigation of air water temperature
   relationships indicated that an increase in mean surface air temperature
   projected for southwest England by the Year 2050 would result in a rise
   of mean winter and summer stream temperatures by 1-6 and 1.3-degrees-C
   respectively. Analysis of streamflow effects on water temperature
   suggested that future indirect impacts of climatic change on thermal
   regime via changes in stream discharge are likely to be minor}},

Abstract = {{Bypass flow in structured soils is dominated by soil hydrological
   processes, such as rain intensity, initial pressure head of the soil,
   surface storage of rain, horizontal contact area and absorption rate,
   and hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix. This study was conducted
   to determine the relative impact of these processes in different soil
   types. A quasi 3-dimensional simulation model was used to calculate the
   effects of these soil hydrological input parameters on surface
   infiltration, macropore flow (with related horizontal absorption) and
   drainage. For light textured soils, surface infiltration was the most
   important term in the water balance. Heavy textured soils, in contrast,
   had drainage as the main term. In the latter soils bypass flow, when
   occurring, was almost equal to the amount of rain applied, indicating
   that absorption processes were strongly reduced. Lateral absorption on
   macropore walls was a minor fraction in the total mass balances, due to
   limited contact area and relatively weak diffusivity forces. Surface
   infiltration is a crucial parameter in bypass flow and is mainly
   dependent on rain intensity, initial pressure head and conductivity of
   the soil matrix. This requires measurement methods for hydraulic
   conductivity that specifically consider the effect of macropores.}},

   establish the cell-to-cell connectivity scheme, which is used to order
   the computations within each time step. Infiltration is computed using
   the Green-Ampt equation, while runoff rates are computed using a
   coupling of the continuity equation and Manning's equation for turbulent
   flow. Storm sewer flows are routed using time-shift routing. The model
   is capable of simulating flow through streets and offers the possibility

   apparently massive and extensive nature. Removal of the topsoil
   identified large (almost-equal-to 1 m2) infilled holes penetrating the

Abstract = {{Although littoral regions in northern lakes may sustain fish spawning
   grounds, little is known of the temporal or spatial aspects of their

   difficulty in properly sampling these regions throughout the year with
   adequate spatial resolution. This problem is especially critical in
   lakes affected by episodic acidification during the spring snowmelt, a
   period of substantial importance to fisheries recruitment. A device was
   constructed to alleviate the problems associated with conventional water
   quality sampling of littoral regions. Constructed of thick walled
   polyvinyl chloride and permanently installed in the nearshore regions of
   an Adirondack lake, the episodic event sampler (EES) provided finely
   resolved (0.25 m) temperature and water chemistry data during the spring
   snowmelt period (February to May) of 1989. Although the construction and
   installation of the sampler represented a significant investment in
   labour and materials, this was offset by the high quality of the data
   collected. As the samplers were relatively undamaged by freeze-thaw
   activity, it is expected that they will continue to provide excellent

Abstract = {{The composition and amount of colloidal and suspended particulate matter
   transported during a small flood event in Magela Creek in tropical
   northern Australia was investigated. The flood studied constituted
   approximately 3\% of the total annual flow, most (90\%) of which
   occurred between mid-January and mid-February of the study year. Three
   fractions were separated from water samples using a sequential method
   involving a continuous flow centrifuge to separate suspended particulate
   matter (SPM; nominally > 1 mum) followed by hollow fibre filtration,
   first using a 0.1 mum filter to separate course colloidal matter (CCM;
   nominal size 1-0.1 mum) and then a 0.015 mum filter to separate fine
   colloidal matter (FCM; nominal size 0.1-0.01 5 mum). The SPM was
   predominantly inorganic (organic matter 21\%), whereas the colloidal
   fractions were dominantly organic matter (CCM 60\%; FCM 83\%). Analysis
   of individual particles using electron microprobe and automated image
   analysis indicated that the mineral fractions in both the SPM and CCM
   were dominated by iron-enriched aluminosilicates (including kaolinite)
   (72-82\%) and quartz (9-10\%), indicative of a highly weathered and
   extensively laterized catchment. Surprisingly there was very little
   difference in the composition of the SPM or CCM fractions during the
   flood event studied, which may indicate either that sediment
   availability was restricted following the major run-off events in
   January and February, or that all the sediment sources within the
   catchment are geochemically similar.
   Approximately the same amounts of particulate (20 tonne), colloidal (21
   tonne) and dissolved material (I 7 tonne) were transported during the 25
   hour period of the main flood peak; over 90\% of the colloidal matter
   was 0.1-1.0 mum in size. These data suggest that previous estimates of
   the amounts of particulate (and colloidal) matter transported by Magela
   Creek, which were based on suspended solids measurements, may have
   underestimated the particulate matter load by as much as 50\%. It is
   possible that the relatively high proportion of colloidal matter is
   unique to Magela Creek because coagulation and aggregation of colloidal
   matter to particulate matter is slow due to the very low concentations
   of calcium and magnesium in these waters. However, if the result is more
   widespread, there are important implications for the global estimates of
   fluvially transported particulate and dissolved materials as many of the
   previous studies may have underestimated the particulate load and
   overestimated the dissolved load.}},

Abstract = {{A kinematic flood routing procedure has been devised for a small
   dendritic headwater gully network on the Western slope of Colorado. The
   program is spatially-distributed, incorporating lateral inflows from 103
   field sites on the network for which channel geometry variables are
   known. This model, in which a lateral inflow algorithm for the
   sideslopes between each channel site is convoluted into a Freeze-type
   (1978) numerical scheme, is fully developed in this paper.
   Although the field basis of the lateral inflow algorithm has been tested
   elsewhere (Faulkner, 1990), sensitivity tests were needed for the
   roughness and hillslope velocity estimates used in the routing
   procedure. After these successful tests, a suitably precalibrated run of
   the model was compared with a field-monitored runoff event on the
   watershed, and results again were encouraging. However, peak
   attentuation downstream was more pronounced in reality than on the
   simulation, so the model was also modified by inclusion of allowances
   for transmission loss. The tendency that the model had displayed for
   peak size attenuation downstream was considerably enhanced.
   Using the model the geomorphic role of the flashfloods which affect the
   watershed in the summer months is briefly considered by applying the
   model to existing records of local summer storm rainfall events as a
   basis for event simulation. These simulations show that downstream
   attenuation of the flood wave on concave networks in steep semiarid
   terrain was likely to be a common occurrence, possibly resulting in
   down-net deposition and differences in geomorphic behaviour between
   upstream and downstream sites. The discussion is finally broadened to
   consider the relative importance of `common' as compared to `freak'
   watershed events in maintaining these differences.}},

Abstract = {{Streams draining the Barrier Range uplands in arid western N.S.W. are
   ephemeral and undergo rapid channel contraction away from the uplands as
   a consequence of transmission loss. These processes are documented on
   the basis of surveys of channel form and bed material at sequential
   sites located along the contracting lowland reaches of two
   representative streams.
   Channel width and depth display considerable fluctuation downstream, but
   cross-sectional area and maximum bed surface grain size decline in a
   very regular manner. Flood discharge, estimated from the channel
   capacity and predicted critical and mean flow velocities, also declines
   regularly. The trends are well fitted by log-linear models, and are
   reported in terms of a half-distance, the channel length in km over
   which the value of a morphometric parameter declines by 50 per cent
   Rates of channel contraction and transmission loss are inferred to be
   inversely proportional to the volume of flow delivered from the upland
   section of the drainage basin.
   Unusual channel characteristics, including extensive tree growth in the
   bed, make application of ordinary flow equations difficult, because
   friction factors cannot be estimated with confidence. Systematic changes
   in the nature of the bed surface in contracting streams such as those
   studied here also have implications for the application of critical
   velocity equations, and highlight a need for further study of desert
   channels.}},

Abstract = {{Soil water dynamics in a forested lowland catchment are studied in order
   to support a research on biogeochemical processes and soil acidification
   in particular.
   The numerical simulation model SWIF, describing soil water dynamics in
   forests, is calibrated and validated for a specific site by using three
   years of daily measurements of pressure head profiles. On the basis of
   model results, the hydrological behaviour of the forest system is
   discussed, with special attention to transpiration and to the vertical
   and temporal dynamics of soil water contents, root water uptake and soil
   water fluxes. As water uptake by oaks and beeches is restricted to the
   unsaturated soil zone, high groundwater tables in the rather poorly
   drained duplex soil appear to have a large impact on the soil water
   dynamics.
   Suggestions are made on the implications of the hydrology for soil
   acidification. This discussion shows that a thorough knowledge of the
   hydrological behaviour of the system can greatly contribute to the
   understanding of biogeochemical processes and soil acidification.
   This paper is the first in a series of three papers. The second
   discusses the possibilities of extrapolating model results from the
   calibration site to other locations within the research area, which have
   varying soil horizon thicknesses (Bouten and Witter, 1992). The third
   paper gives a full description of the model SWIF with some technical
   details. It also discusses its numerical behaviour (Tiktak and Bouten,
   1992).}},

Abstract = {{This Paper is the second in a series of three papers, dealing with the
   hydrology of a forested lowland catchment, within the context of soil
   acidification research. The hydrological behaviour of the unsaturated
   soil zone is described with the numerical simulation model SWIF. The
   first paper presents a site specific model calibration and discusses the
   implications of the hydrological behaviour for soil acidification
   (Bouten et al., 1992). The present paper deals with the extension of the
   model results from one specific site to a larger research area. A third
   paper gives a model description and discusses its numerical behaviour
   (Tiktak and Bouten, 1992).
   In order to evaluate the effects of the field variability of soil
   horizon thicknesses, the model SWIF is validated by using measured
   groundwater table dynamics of three sites, each having different soil
   horizon thicknesses. Subsequently, a sensitivity analysis is carried out
   in order to select the location-dependent model parameters that cause
   the main variation in hydrological behaviour. Finally, the spatial
   patterns of model results and of the location-dependent model parameters
   are compared.
   The drainage depth and the depth of the boundary between the sandy top
   soil and the underlying boulder clay appear to be the key parameters
   that cause large differences in transpiration and in the vertical
   distribution of root water uptake and soil water fluxes. Spatial
   patterns of model results, therefore, also show resemblance with the
   spatial patterns of these location-dependent model parameters.
   Simulation results for a reference location with averaged soil horizon
   thicknesses turn out to be beyond the 90 per cent confidence interval of
   the areal mean model results. This emphasizes the necessity to simulate
   first and then average.}},

Abstract = {{The model SWIF (Soil Water In Forested ecosystems) is presented. SWIF is
   a model for the simulation of water flow in the unsaturated soil zone,
   including water extraction by roots and lateral saturated drainage. The
   model gives a half-implicit finite difference solution to the flow
   equation. For minimizing computing time, the model chooses its
   integration time steps based on the rate of change of soil water
   conditions. The model is not a conceptually new model. However, it meets
   the requirements of an entirely modular programme in which new theories
   can easily be implemented. The hydrology of the canopy and the forest
   floor is described in independent modules.
   Simulation results are evaluated in relation to temporal and vertical
   discretization, using a simulation of soil water dynamics in a forest
   over a period of two growing seasons. Both the site description and the
   simulation results are given in an accompanying paper (Bouten et al.,
   1992). In another paper a sensitivity analysis of the model is given
   (Bouten and Witter, 1992).
   In order to evaluate the effects of temporal discretization of boundary
   conditions, the length of the interval of constant averaged boundary
   conditions was varied from one hour to one month. The simulated annual
   transpiration is found to be dependent on this interval for a wet year,
   but not for a dry year. When the boundary conditions are taken constant
   for intervals shorter than one day, simulated soil water contents show a
   highly dynamic behaviour during and directly after heavy rainfall. Then
   small integration time steps are required and computing time increases
   strongly.
   For the evaluation of the effects of vertical discretization, the number
   of soil layers was varied from 5 to 40. The yearly transpiration appears
   to be almost independent of the layer thickness as long as the horizon
   boundaries are not altered, but the temporal distribution of
   transpiration and water contents are affected. The required computing
   time for the simulation of the water balance of a full growing season
   increases from 2.5 minutes for a simulation of five layers to 18 minutes
   for a simulation of 40 layers.
   When model results are evaluated on a yearly basis, they appear to be
   not very sensitive to the temporal and vertical discretization. Only if
   research aims require more detailed model results on a shorter
   timescale, higher computing times are to be accepted.}},

   rational framework for treating the difficult to characterize spatial

Abstract = {{Current and projected UK activities with the Systeme Hydrologique
   Europeen (SHE) hydrological modelling system are examined. Development
   of the SHE arose from the need for a new modelling approach for use in
   assessing the environmental impacts of river basin development and the
   system is particularly suited to predicting the impacts of land use and
   climatic changes and to applications to basins with sparse data sets.
   The basic hydrology model is now being developed into a powerful
   contaminant and sediment transport modelling system called SHETRAN-UK
   and components are also being proposed to account for landslide and
   gully erosion. Applications of the SHE have been made at spatial scales
   ranging from 30 m2 to 5000 km2 and in a variety of environments. These
   have demonstrated an ability to achieve calibration on the basis of
   short time series records and field evaluation     of parameters, to
   provide multiple outputs on a spatially and temporally distributed
   basis, and to explore basin response mechanisms. They have also
   indicated the importance of integrating field measurements within the
   calibration process. The effect of the scale of model grids on parameter
   evaluation and on simulation results still needs to be investigated and
   there is a need for field process studies in areas where there is a poor
   understanding, to improve certain of the process representations within
   the SHE. However, new ideas are being explored to account for subgrid
   spatial variability in parameter values and to develop a validation
   methodology for testing the predictive capability of the SHE. Future
   developments will include the use of geographical information systems
   and data processing packages to aid data handling, expert systems to
   improve the efficiency of calibration, and parallel processing and other
   new computational techniques. An expanding range of applications will
   see physically based hydrological modelling systems at the core of
   decision support systems and integrated at the continental scale with

   estimation of distributed models based on generalized likelihood
   measures. The GLUE procedure works with multiple sets of parameter

   different sets of values may be equally likely as simulators of a

   into the calibration; Bayesian updating of likelihood values and
   evaluating the value of additional observations to the calibration
   process are described. The procedure is computationally intensive but

Abstract = {{Increasingly, research is indicating that subsurface flow paths govern
   ion transport within river catchments. Distributed prediction of these
   solute flow paths in typically heterogeneous catchments must inevitably
   be highly uncertain without some identification of a spatial structure
   relating small-scale measurements of soil properties to flow predictions
   distributed over large catchments. To date, the evidence for profile and
   catenal structure within soil hydrological properties and resultant
   solute flow paths is not fully embraced by the hydrological community.
   As a consequence soil parameters are often poorly distributed within
   catchment-scale distributed models. This paper seeks, first, to
   generalize the disparate sources of evidence of parameter and flow path
   structure within the profile-ward and catena-ward dimensions. Second, to
   outline how much of this structure has been incorporated into previous
   hydrological simulations using distributed models, and third, to examine
   the physical basis of attempts to simplify parameter and flow path
   dimensions using pedological classifications. The available evidence
   suggests that a considerable number of world soils show profile-ward
   structure within their hydrological properties and resultant flow paths.
   Changes in profile-ward patterns along catenal sequences remain
   uncertain. The Plynlimon region of mid-Wales has been the focus for many
   detailed studies of solute flow paths, catchment-scale model
   simulations, soil property characterizations and soil classification.
   Comparison of these studies suggests that most model simulations and
   hydromorphic classifications of soil taxa fail to distinguish adequately
   between soil horizons and soil types with markedly different property
   distributions. Preliminary analysis, however, suggests that by using a
   catena based criterion to classify the hydromorphic characteristics of
   soils, soil elements with distinct patterns of properties and flow paths
   can be identified. This might suggest that the accuracy of distributed
   predictions of ion movements within river catchments could be greatly
   improved by the derivation of profile-specific patterns in soil
   properties. These profile-specific effective parameters need to be
   derived from measurements over a range of scales, including individual
   layers, profiles and complete catenas.}},

Abstract = {{A rainfall and run-off model has been developed which is based on a
   rectangular grid cell network. The run-off in each cell is estimated
   empirically and is routed through the network to the principal drainage
   lines. Information on the land cover in each 50 x 50 m cell is
   interpreted from remotely sensed data, gathered by an orbiting
   satellite. Values of topographic parameters for each cell are derived
   from a digital model of the terrain. Other more conventional data are
   acquired by digitizing maps. The large amounts of data required in this
   approach are handled by a geographical information system (GIS), which
   is a management system specially designed for data with spatial
   characteristics. A GIS has functions which allow the user to combine the
   many layers of data within the GIS arithmetically or logically to
   provide fresh information. At the current stage of development the GIS
   provides estimates of the United States Department of Agriculture Soil
   Conservation Service curve number for estimating the run-off in each
   cell. An analysis of the digital terrain model defines the pathway taken
   by run-off from each cell and the run-off is routed from cell to cell as
   far as the principal drainage lines, where a conventional hydraulic
   analysis is used. The model benefits from a simple and robust approach
   to run-off estimation distributed on a very fine grid. An important
   feature of the model is its ability to use historical satellite images
   to estimate changes in the catchment's response over a period of time.
   Future changes in land use may also be easily incorporated into the GIS.
   The model is being tested on data from the Tywi catchment in West Wales,
   UK, which had undergone large changes in land cover due to forestation.}},

   the ANSWERS distributed runoff and erosion model.  Simulation results
   obtained were compared with measured values.  Field infiltration
   measurements indicated spatial correlation at much smaller distances
   than the size of an element.  Therefore, at first only the error of the
   mean had to be taken into consideration for block infiltration rates. 
   Consequently, not only single hydrographs were produced, but also error
   bands.  Secondly, nine other hypothetical spatial correlation structures
   were also evaluated using Monte Carlo methods.  In particular at low
   nugget variances, increasing spatial correlation of infiltration
   resulted in increasing coefficients of variation in model outputs.
   In general, rainstorms with low rainfall intensities were more difficult
   to simulate accurately than extreme events with high rainfall
   intensities.  This is explained by the greater influence of the

Abstract = {{A sediment budget was developed for the 1.7 km2 Maluna Creek drainage
   basin located in the Hunter Valley, New South Wales, Australia, for the
   period 1971-86.  The impact of viticulture, which commenced at Maluna in
   1971, was studied using erosion plots, with caesium-137 as an indicator
   of both soil erosion and sedimentation.  Two methods were used to
   estimate vineyard soil losses from caesium-137 measurements.  Sediment
   output from the catchment was measured for three years, and extrapolated
   from readings taken at a nearby long-term stream flow gauging station
   for the remaining 13 years.  Relative amounts of soil loss from forest
   (60 per cent basin area), grazing land (30 per cent) and vineyards (10
   per cent) were calculated.  Soil losses by rain splash detachment were
   ten times greater from bare/cultivated sufaces than from the forest. 
   Erosion plots of area 2 m2 showed no significant differences in soil
   loss between forest and grassland but, under bare soil, losses were 100
   times greater.  The Cs-137 method was employed to calculate net soil
   loss from all vineyard blocks using both a previously established
   calibration curve and a proportional model.  The latter method gave
   estimates of soil loss which were 3.9 times greater than by the
   calibration curve, and indicated that average soil losses from the
   vineyard were equivalent to 62 t ha-1 y-1 (1971-86).  It was estimated
   that the forest contributed 1.8 per cent, the grazing land 1.6 per cent,
   and the vineyard 96.6 per cent of the total soil loss during that
   period.  Sediment storages within the fluvial system adjacent to the
   vineyard ws 9460 t for the period, whereas sediment output was
   equivalent to 215 t km-1 y-1.  Independent measurements of soil erosion,
   storage, and output showed that 56 per cent of the eroded sediment
   remained in the catchment, and 34 per cent was transported out by Maluna
   Creek.  The budget was able to be balanced to within 10 per cent.}},

Abstract = {{Under controlled laboratory conditions, artificial rain leaches solute
   from snow columns, and gives rise to leachate with a composition similar
   to snowmelt, in addition to the solute initially present in the

   normalized to the concentration of ions found in the original snow and
   corrected for the solute present in the artificial rain, is similar to
   those reported in other laboratory and field studies of snowmelt
   composition, but there is some evidence that the concentration of
   leached ions declines more rapidly than during snowmelt.  Similarly, as
   in snowmelt studies, not all ions are leached with the same efficiency. 
   Bearing in mind the confounding influences of snow crystal morphology
   and snow column hydrology, it seems likely that rain will leach solute
   from snowpack during rain-on-snow events, in a manner similar to
   leaching by snowmelt, and that the precise composition of the leachate

   production was high in years when fertilizer was applied and water yield
   was very similar to that expected from the original forest cover.  As

   increases in the magnitude of both low frequency flows and,

   deadened in the catchment, the discharge levels in all flow frequency
   classes were higher.  Natural revegetation was then allowed and water

   material and particle size characteristics of suspended sediment, and
   (3) temporal variation in the particle size characteristics of suspended

Abstract = {{Sediment redistribution within near-level agricultural fields in the
   Gray Wooded soil zone of Saskatchewan was studied using the artificial
   environmental tracer caesium-137 (Cs-137).  The objective of this study
   was to estimate erosion rates caused by wind erosion, and land clearing
   techniques (i.e. bulldozing).  Net rates of erosion and deposition were
   quantified over the past 30 years on three fields.  Wind erosion was
   estimated to be approximately 1.0 t ha-1 y-1 on a near-level field, with
   50 per cent of the sampling sites having erosion rates in excess of soil
   formation.  Bulldozing produced median net sediment flux values of
   between 40 and 90 t ha-1 y-1.  In addition, between 65 and 85 per cent
   of the sampling sites had erosion rates in excess of the maximum
   tolerable limit (i.e. 11.0 t ha-1 y-1).  These results indicate
   significant accelerated erosion results from land clearing techniques
   used in central Saskatchewan.  Bulldozing of the fields removed the
   LFH-horizon and exposed the underlying mineral horizon.  Bulk densitites
   of the 0 to 15 cm layer in the cleared fields were 27 to 55 per cent
   greater than the comparable depth increment within the undisturbed
   forest site.  Organic carbon concentrations within the 1930s, 1979, and
   1987 fields were decreased by 47, 42, and 37 per cent, respectively
   following cultivation and bulldozing.  Decreases in total nitrogen for

Abstract = {{Ten large volume water samples were taken from the Rhone River
   (Switzerland-France) in November 1989 for recovery of total suspended
   sediment by continuous flow centrifugation.  The samples were
   freeze-dried and analysed for particle size, organic carbon, total
   nitrogen, and carbonate.  For comparative purposes, four bed sediments
   collected in July 1989 are also described.  The Rhone can be subdivided
   into three sections on the basis of the origins of the water.  The first
   section is the Upper Rhone River draining into Lake Geneva.  Waters are
   derived from glaciers, with low temperature and conductivity and high
   turbidity.  Suspended sediment is coarse, has a bimodal distribution,
   and is low in both organic matter and carbonate.  The second reach is
   from Lake Geneva to the confluence with the Saone at Lyon and has warmer
   water with higher conductivity and very low turbidity.  Suspended
   sediment is higher in organic matter, with high carbonate originating
   from the lake.  The final section is from Lyon to Arles, with warmer
   water and higher conductivity and turbidity due to modification by the
   Saone.  Sediment is rich in organic matter, which may account for an
   observed decline in oxygen in the river waters downstream from Lyon. 
   Carbonate in these sediments also decreases due to increased turbidity
   from the Saone.  Suspended sediments other than from the Upper Rhone
   show a remarkable consistency in grain size, predominantly in the fine
   silts (mode 9-11-mu-m).  This consistency indicates a high degree of
   suitability for geochemical analysis.  Bed sediments were bimodal
   throughout, with a dominant coarse population in two out of the four
   samples.  Grain size statistical parameters could be easily explained by
   application of the theory of mixing of two major populations in the sand
   size (bed traction load) and the fine silt/clay size (suspended sediment
   load).}},

Abstract = {{The water balance of a 600 m2 field site on a lateritic hillslope in
   Kerala, southwest India, has been studied during two southwest monsoon
   seasons. Surface runoff was of minor importance while infiltration and
   evapotranspiration were the major components amounting to approximately
   2/3 and 1/3 of the rainfall, respectively. Groundwater response was
   rapid, involving fluctuations of several metres. Recharge mechanisms
   hypothesized are water movement via preferred pathways from the ground
   surface to the capillary fringe where rapid rise in groundwater level is
   brought about by a transmitted pressure pulse. Groundwater recharge was
   found normally to take place during the southwest monsoon season only.
   The field study demonstrates that seasonal shallow groundwater recharge
   representing the major portion of the rainfall may be observed in this
   lateritic terrain in the humid tropics. It indicates a good potential
   for further groundwater development. Moreover, conditions are conducive
   to a considerable contribution to possible recharge to deeper aquifers.
   The observed groundwater recharge is the result of a complex process on
   which further research will throw more light.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental tritium was measured in 33 natural water samples
   representative of precipitation, stream runoff, and groundwater (derived
   principally from production wells) within the Georgia Piedmont Province.
   Major ion analyses were used to assist in the interpretation of the
   tritium results. Tritium concentrations were significantly greater
   within shallow groundwater derived from the regolith (28-34 TU) and
   stream runoff (25-30 TU) than within recent rainfall (4-17 TU). Based
   upon the decay-corrected tritium input function, this probably indicates
   that at least some of the shallow water is stored within the regolith
   for a period of approximately 25 years.
   A `post-bomb' component of recharge was present in all groundwater
   derived from production wells in the study area. Groundwater sampled
   from the bedrock aquifers was commonly less tritiated than either stream
   runoff or shallow water stored in the regolith. The lower tritium
   concentrations may have resulted from the mixing of `pre-bomb' water
   stored within the fractures or the transitional zone directly above the
   bedrock and modern water stored in the shallow regolith. The
   preponderance of modern water provides evidence that groundwater flow
   paths are areally restricted within this setting, probably confined to
   local surface water drainage basins. The residence time of groundwater
   in the Piedmont is limited by the lack of deep, gravity-driven regional
   flow and the localized vertical flow induced by pumping. The results of
   this study indicate that relatively small tritium concentration
   variations (10-20 TU) may have regional hydrological significance in the
   southeastern Piedmont Province and similar settings.}},

Abstract = {{The factors controlling the chemistry of 69 low-order streams in the
   Blue Ridge and Valley and Ridge physiographic provinces of Virginia and
   Maryland were studied over a 13-month period. Principal component
   analysis was used to examine regional patterns in stream chemistry and
   to examine the degree to which the chemistry of low-order streams is
   controlled by the bedrock upon which they flow. Streams clustered into
   regionally isolated groups, strongly related to bedrock type, with SO42-
   and HCO3- the chemical variables of most importance. Sulphate
   concentrations appear to be strongly controlled by climate and
   hydrology, and sorption in the soils within the watershed. Much of the
   atmospherically derived SO42- accumulates in watersheds during the
   growing season and is later flushed out. Weathering reactions were found
   to be particularly important in the production of HCO3-, accounting for
   91 per cent on an annual basis, and export of divalent cations from
   these watersheds, accounting for 48-50 per cent on an annual basis.
   About half of non-anthropogenic Na+ was derived from weathering of
   silicates, whereas nearly all K+ was identified with leaching by SO42-.
   Water chemistry was strongly related to the rock type in the watershed
   and the weatherability of the component minerals. Rock type is not a
   randomly distributed function; instead, it is controlled by geologic
   factors that result in clusters of similar rock types in a given region.
   When planning large synoptic studies, it is extremely important to
   consider that a sampling scheme based on random sampling of a
   non-randomly distributed function may not provide the most accurate
   representation of the variables of interest. Instead, a hierarchical
   sampling scheme may be indicated. Our results also suggest that,
   although one sample in time may be sufficient to characterize the
   primary geochemical factors controlling stream chemistry throughout the
   year, it may not be sufficient to detect subtle, flow-related
   alterations in chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Despite considerable research performed on forested catchments in the
   Ouachita Mountains of Oklahoma and Arkansas, little information on
   hydrological processes in operation is available. Based on catchment
   physical characteristics, subsurface flow was thought to be an important
   hydrological process in the region. Therefore, this study was undertaken
   to determine the occurrence, rates, timing and volumes of subsurface
   flow, and to estimate the importance of subsurface flow as a streamflow
   generating process. Subsurface flow was collected from three hillslope
   sites on a 7.7 ha forested catchment. Hillslope sites drained through
   natural seepage faces located near stream channels. Subsurface flow was
   collected from three depths at each hillslope site, below the litter
   layer, below the A horizon, and within the B horizon (Bt21). Subsurface
   flow occurred and was measured during 11 of 31 rainfall events.
   Subsurface flow responded rapidly to the initiation of and to changes in
   intensity of rainfall at all depths. The rapid response was indicative
   of flow through soil macropores. B horizon subsurface flow commenced
   within 10 to 180 min of the initiation of rainfall. Multiple linear
   regression showed that the volume of subsurface flow generated during a
   given storm was directly related to rainfall depth and a 7-day
   antecedent precipitation index used to represent antecedent water
   content. About 67 per cent of the total subsurface flow collected during
   the study was produced in one large storm under wet antecedent
   conditions. The storm was equal to the 2-year, 24-hour storm for the
   region. Measured subsurface flow volumes were extended to the watershed
   scale to provide estimates of catchment-wide contributions to
   streamflow. It was estimated that subsurface flow contributed from 1 to
   48 per cent of total quickflow measured at the catchment outlet. Based
   on the timing of subsurface flow, it was estimated that subsurface flow
   may contribute up to 70 per cent of quickflow before and soon after peak
   flow.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of stone cover on the generation and continuity of
   overland flow is a function of several variables, primarily stone size,
   distance (spacing) between stones, and stone position (on top of the
   soil surface or partially embedded). The initial hypothesis of the
   present study were that stone size affects overland flow generation by
   inducing `concentration overland flow' and that the distance between
   stones affects overland flow continuity.
   With respect to stone size and distance between stones, opposing results
   have been found in the literature. Accordingly, the present paper
   reports on laboratory experiments which were conducted to investigate,
   systematically, the effect on overland flow of stone size, distance
   between stones, and stone position.
   The main conclusions were: 1. Stone cover tended to induce overland
   flow, relative to bare soil. Small stones, however, especially in a
   low-cover percentage setting, and when resting on top of the soil
   surface, produced less overland flow than bare soil. 2. Overland flow
   was positively related to stone size, but inversely related to distance
   between stones. 3. Overland flow yield was always greater when stones
   were embedded than when on top of the soil surface. 4. The effect of
   stone size on increasing the degree of overland flow was of greater
   significance than the effect of the distance between stones on reducing
   overland flow.}},

Abstract = {{To estimate seasonal changes in recharge to the underlying sandy
   aquifer, the soil water dynamics of the unsaturated zone was monitored
   down to a depth of 20 m over a period of three years (1985 to 1987). The
   measurements were made by a neutron probe at eight locations beneath a
   native vegetation in a semiarid region, Western Australia, receiving
   precipitation of 775 mm yr-1. A relatively simple method, based on the
   analyses of sequentially measured soil water profiles involving
   utilization of zero flux plane in the unsaturated zone, is presented and
   used to compute seasonal recharge rates.
   Drainage fluxes (recharge rates) below two specified depths were
   estimated. These were: R1 (water flux at a depth of 10 m, just below the
   maximum rooting depth) and R2 (water flux at a depth of 18 m, just above
   the water table). These two estimates were significantly different both
   on a seasonal and annual basis, but their cumulative values for the
   three year period were very similar. While the annual precipitation
   varied from 525 to 850 mm yr-1, the corresponding spatially averaged R1
   varied from 34 to 149 mm yr-1, and R2 varied from 65 to 80 mm yr-1. A
   significant difference in recharge between the upslope and downslope
   positions on a hillslope was ascribed to differences in vegetation
   density of the understorey and differences in hydraulic properties of
   subsoils.
   For the three year period, the average R1 and R2 were 13 per cent and 10
   per cent of the precipitation respectively. These values compare
   favourably with a long-term estimate based on an environmental tracer
   technique.}},

   It was found that some weeks of consistently wet weather were required
   for water repellency breakdown, and a frequency of rainfall much greater
   than normal in the study area for it to remain broken down. Even after
   an extended period of breakdown, it was found that repellency can be
   reestablished after one week of hot dry weather.
   Laboratory tests were used to examine the major repellency processes;
   three were identified and the relative importance of each considered in
   the context of the field study. The relative influence of each depended
   on the physical and chemical characteristics of the sites.
   The repellent soil samples were more repellent to water of throughfall
   origin, and even more repellent to stemflow than to distilled water. The
   repellency response also varied with the type of vegetative cover

   the water equivalent distribution over the test area.  The advantages of
   the interpolation method used lie in the optimal (effective, unbiased)

Abstract = {{The release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into drainage waters was
   modelled using the hydrology of the Birkenes model of stream water
   chemistry and estimated parameters for the formation and decay of
   soluble organic matter in the soil.  The model was first tested against
   soil water DOC concentrations over a three year period in the Loch Dee
   catchment in southwest Scotland.  It predicted annual cycles in DOC at
   one site, but underestimated maximum DOC in the first year,
   overestimated in the following year, and predicted values very similar
   to the measured values in the third year.  With small modifications to
   the parameters controlling organic matter addition and decay it
   successfully predicted DOC variations at two other soil water sites with
   smaller mean DOC.
   Further tests were made against short-term DOC variations in a stream
   draining a subcatchment of Loch Ard in west-central Scotland, using the
   same decay and addition parameters.  Prediction of temporal variation
   was good, although predicted concentrations were about 25 per cent less

   viminalis at a mountainous high rainfall site (900 m a.s.l.) in
   Tallaganda State Forest of the Upper Shoalhaven Catchment.  Approximate
   canopy storage capacity (Sc) of the pine was 54 l, and that of the

   8.3 per cent of total incident rainfall over a period of 18 months, from
   June 1975 to December 1976.  The exponential model that provided the
   best fit to overall data relating I to gross rainfall (P(g)) was of good
   precision for the pine (r2 = 0.73) but rather poor precision for the
   eucalypt (r2 = 0.27).  A consistent pattern in interception data of the
   two canopy types suggested that variation in I was related to change in
   pervasive conditions influencing rates of evaporation from wet canopies
   during rainfall.  Multiple regression analyses confirmed that factors
   such as rainfall intensity and windspeed explained some of the variation
   in eucalypt I but little in pine I.
   Negative eucalypt I and corresponding low values of pine I over a wide
   range of P(g) (up to 20 mm) suggest that capture of wind-borne
   precipitation (cloud, mist, or fog) had also complicated the canopy
   precipitation balances.}},

Abstract = {{Soil water regimes and water balances are presented for a series of
   drained and undrained experimental grassland plots, intended to examine
   the agronomic consequences of drainage.  Although drainage has lowered
   the watertables and reduced the duration of waterlogging in the drained
   plots, its effects in terms either of the total water quantities leaving
   the site or of peak flows is quite small.  The major effect of drainage
   is to alter the route of water loss from the site.  In its undrained
   state, the soil is waterlogged for the majority of the winter, incident
   rainfall cannot infiltrate, and water leaves as surface runoff or
   near-surface flow.  The introduction of fissures by mole drainage both
   provides an outlet and enhances the macroporosity, so that the rain
   moves rapidly through the soil and appears as drainflow.  Consequently,
   the additional delay in generating peak runoff through the drainage
   system is only of the order of 30 minutes on this site.}},

Abstract = {{Previous discussions of the catastrophic drainage of ice-dammed lakes
   have centred on mechanisms where characteristics of the lake are crucial
   to drainage initiation, for example dam flotation or tunnel formation at
   a critical lake depth.  This paper describes a mechanism for lake
   drainage where drainage initiation depends on the characteristics of the
   glacier and is independent of the characteristics of the lake. 
   Prediction of this mechanism must be based on glacier dynamics, whereas
   the mechanisms most commonly discussed previously are best predicted
   primarily on the basis of lake evolution.
   An ice-dammed lake at the margin of the glacier Solheimajokull, in
   southern Iceland, was observed to drain rapidly into the sub- or
   englacial drainage system, supplying water and debris to the bed or
   interior of the glacier.  Geomorphological evidence suggests that the
   lake drains and refills periodically, discharging up to 13300 m3 of
   water into the glacier-hydrological system.  The depth of the maximum
   lake is insufficient to cause either flotation of the ice margin or
   tunnel opening by plastic deformation of the ice, and we suggest that
   sudden drainage is related to ice-bed separations associated with
   specific glacier flow states rather than to a critical lake depth
   threshold.  This mechanism of lake drainage has implications for
   conditions at the glacier bed, for the development of basal ice and for
   the entrainment of debris into the glacier, as well as for the
   prediction of potentially hazardous catastrophic drainage events and
   jokulhlaups from ice-dammed lakes.}},

Abstract = {{Current conceptual runoff models hypothesize that stormflow generation
   on the Canadian Shield is a combination of subsurface stormflow and
   saturation overland flow.  This concept was tested during spring runoff
   in a small (3.3 ha) headwater basin using:  (1) isotopic and chemical
   hydrograph separation and (2) field mapping and direct tracing of
   saturated areas.  Isotopic and chemical hydrograph separation indicated
   three runoff components:  (1) pre-melt subsurface flow; (2) subsurface
   flow of new (event) water; and (3) direct precipitation on to saturated
   areas (DPS).  During early thaw-freeze cycles, their relative
   contributions to total flow remained constant (65 per cent, 30 per cent,
   and 5 per cent respectively).  It is hypothesized that lateral flow
   along the bedrock/mineral soil interface, possibly through macropores,
   supplied large volumes of subsurface flow (of both old and new water)
   rapidly to the stream channel.  Much higher contributions of DPS were
   observed during an intensive rain-on-snow event (15 per cent of total
   flow).  Mapping and direct tracing of saturated areas using lithium
   bromide, suggested that saturated area size was positively correlated to
   stream discharge but its response lagged behind that of discharge. 
   These observations suggest that the runoff mechanisms, and hence the
   sources of stream flow, will vary depending on storm characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The use of a single-bowl continuous-flow centrifuge (CFC,
   Sharples-Pennwalt Model AS-12) for dewatering suspended sediment from
   large volumes of river water is evaluated.  Sediment-recovery efficiency
   of 86-91 per cent is comparable to that of other types of CFC units. 
   The recovery efficiency is limited by the particle-size distribution of
   the feed water and by the limiting particle diameter that is retained in
   the centrifuge bowl.  The limiting particle diameter, using the
   parameters for this study (bowl radius = 10.5 cm; bowl length = 71.1 cm;
   rotational velocity = 16000 r min-1; flow rate = 2 L min-1, and an
   assumed hydrated particle density = 1.7 gm cm-3), is 370 nm.  There
   seems to be no particle-size fractionation within the centrifuge bowl -
   the median particle size was the same at the top as at the bottom. 
   Particle electrophoretic mobility plays some role in fractionation of
   particles within the centrifuge.  The mobility ranged from -1.19 to
   -2.01 x 10(-8) m2 V-1 s-1, which is typical of clays coated with organic
   matter, the charge of which is partially neutralized by divalent cations
   and iron.  Contamination by trace metals and organics is minimized by
   coating all surfaces that come in contact with the sample with either
   FEP or PFA Teflon and using a removable FEP Teflon liner in the
   centrifuge bowl.  Because of the physical and chemical factors affecting
   particle fractionation within the centrifuge, care must be exercised in
   interpreting the environmental consequences of particles collected by
   continuous-flow centrifugation.}},

Abstract = {{The topography of a catchment has a major impact on the hydrological,
   geomorphological, and biological processes active in the landscape.  The
   spatial distribution of topographic attributes can often be used as an
   indirect measure of the spatial variability of these processes and
   allows them to be mapped using relatively simple techniques.  Many
   geographic information systems are being developed that store
   topographic information as the primary data for analysing water resource
   and biological problems.  Furthermore, topography can be used to develop
   more physically realistic structures for hydrologic and water quality
   models that directly account for the impact of topography on the
   hydrology.  Digital elevation models are the primary data used in the
   analysis of catchment topography.  We describe elevation data sources,
   digital elevation model structures, and the analysis of digital
   elevation data for hydrological, geomorphological, and biological
   applications.  Some hydrologic models that make use of digital

Abstract = {{A rectangular grid digital elevation model (DEM) for Australia, with a
   horizontal resolution of 1/40 degree of latitude and longitude
   (approximately 2.5 km), has recently been calculated from continent-wide
   coverages of point elevation and stream line data using an elevation
   gridding technique which incorporates a drainage enforcement algorithm. 
   An automated drainage basin analysis of this DEM is in close agreement
   with existing basin analyses, both for the better surveyed coastal areas
   with well-defined relief, and for large areas of low relief that make up
   much of the interior Lake Eyre basin and the Murray-Darling basin.  The
   analysis of the arid western plateau region differs from the currently
   accepted analysis but is in broad agreement with a previous analysis of
   palaeodrainage systems based on topographic and geological information. 
   The drainage analysis is used to calculate cumulative distributions of
   spatially distributed, hydrologically significant, terrain parameters
   for the Murray-Darling and Derwent River basins.  The adequacy of the
   resolution of the DEM for continental hydrological analyses is assessed
   by comparing drainage basin analyses and cumulative distributions of

Abstract = {{Hydrologic processes are affected by the spatial variability of soils,
   topography, land use and cover, climate, and human-induced changes and
   management.  Because contaminants are transported by runoff to surface
   waters and by infiltration and deep percolation to groundwater,
   hydrologic processes are often at the core of water quality and quantity
   concerns.  Water quality and quantity affected by non-point sources of
   contaiminants is dependent on spatially distributed attributes of a
   catchment or watershed.
   The integration or linkage of the spatial data handling capabilities of
   a GIS with a distributed process, hydrologic model offers the advantages
   associated with utilizing the full information content of the spatially
   distributed data to analyse the hydrologic processes.  Distributed
   process models use computational elements smaller than the scale of the
   process or the system being modelled.  The information content of the
   model output is greater than a lumped model though obtained at greater
   cost.  A GIS is capable of manipulating both the input and output
   parameters required by distributed process models.
   This paper presents a review of water quality and quantity modelling and
   GIS applications in water resources.  An application of the GIS,
   ARC/INFO and the finite element solution to the kinematic wave equations
   is presented.  In this application, ARC/INFO is used to process the
   spatially variable terrain in a small watershed using a Triangular
   Irregular Network on TIN.  The TIN facets are used to provide land
   surface slope in a finite element solution of overland flow which is a
   fundamental subprocess affecting non-point source, water quality and
   quantity.}},

Abstract = {{A geographic information system (ARC/INFO) is used to develop a model of
   the urban environment for storm drainage analysis.  The drainage system
   is divided into surface terrain, stormwater intakes, and the drainage
   network.  The intakes hydrologically connect surface and subsurface flow
   elements.  The drainage network consists of both man-made structures
   (pipes and channels) and overland flow paths that connect them.  The
   land surface terrain is defined by a triangulated irregular network
   (TIN), which is used to determine necessary parameters for design flow
   calculations.  Each of the three basic elements of the urban terrain
   representation, inlets-defined as points, drainage network-defined as
   lines, and surface terrain-defined as TINs, has its own specific data
   structure.  The three databases are fully integrated, and the stored
   information is used to determine whether inlets pipes can convey 10- and
   25-year design flows, using the rational method.
   An `intelligent network builder', is developed using the Nexpert Object
   expert system shell, to test for completeness of databases and flow
   paths prior to hydrological computations.  If necessary, the intelligent
   network builder starts up ARC/INFO procedures that fill in missing links
   in the drainage network and missing flow properties of its components. 
   An example application is made to the drainage system of a section of
   City of Asheville, North Carolina.}},
