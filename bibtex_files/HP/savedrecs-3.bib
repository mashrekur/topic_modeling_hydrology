Abstract = {{Many studies have identified global warming and climate change as some
   of the biggest challenges facing Canada. In this paper, the regional
   temporal trend in river flows is investigated using a space-time model.
   Though the primary focus is the time component, the spatial relationship
   among monitoring stations in a region is used to develop a space-time
   model that is composed of a random time trend as a function of space,
   and a random error term as a function of both time and space. The
   estimate of regional time trend is a linear combination of the
   differenced observations that minimizes the variance of estimated
   errors.
   Data from 248 river stations in the Reference Hydrometric Basin Network
   (RHBN) established by Environment Canada is analysed. These hydrological
   monitoring stations are grouped into ten non-overlapping homogeneous
   regions covering all of Canada. An estimate of trend, along with its
   variance, is calculated for each region. Some significant trends are
   found for the annual mean, maximum and minimum flows, as well as for the
   mean monthly flows for July and December, and are consistent with those
   detected in other Canadian studies. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{An analysis of snow cover measurement data in a number of physiographic
   regions and landscapes has shown that fields of snow cover
   characteristics can be considered as random fields with homogeneous
   increments and that these fields exhibit statistical self-similarity. A
   physically based distributed model of snowmelt runoff generation
   developed for the Upper Kolyma River basin (the catchment area is about
   100 000 km(2)) has been used to estimate the sensitivity of snowmelt
   dynamics over the basin and flood hydrographs to the parameterization of
   subgrid effects based on the hypothesis of statistical self-similarity
   of the maximum snow water equivalent fields. Such parameterization of
   subgrid effects enables us to improve the description of snowmelt
   dynamics both within subgrid areas and over the entire river basin. The
   snowmelt flood hydrographs appear less sensitive to the self-similarity
   of snow cover over subgrid areas than to the dynamics of snowmelt
   because of a too large catchment area of the basin under consideration.
   However, for certain hydrometeorological conditions and for small river
   basins this effect may lead to significant changes of the calculated
   hydrographs. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Runoff regimes in most northern basins are controlled by the melting
   snow cover. A common method for evaluating runoff consists in
   correlating ambient air temperature and recorded hydrometric gauge
   values. The air temperature is the principal variable to estimate the
   importance of the melting of the snow cover when using a global
   conceptual model such as the snowmelt runoff model (SRM). The
   temperature, which is often only measured at one weather station, must
   be extrapolated to the whole basin according to some kind of lapse rate.
   This extrapolation often assumes that air temperature is representative
   for a wide region, which is often not the case. The estimation of
   temperature values is critical, especially for large basins where the
   surface processes are largely influenced by a forest cover. This project
   has two objectives: (1) applying a mostly high mountain SRM to the
   Batiscan River Basin, in the Province of Quebec, an area occupied by a
   forest with a rolling hill topography; (2) investigate the impact of the
   extrapolation strategy for estimating temperature values and its
   importance in the runoff modelling. A statistical comparison between the
   different modelling attempts was performed. This allowed us to obtain a
   sensitivity analysis of the snow runoff modelling in relation to the
   extrapolation of the temperature values. Our results showed that the
   weather station, used to perform the runoff modelling, should be located
   in the most representative land cover of the study area. Otherwise, the
   values of a synthetic regional weather station were more reliable for
   the modelling. Finally, before pursuing any snowmelt modelling with the
   SRM, the temperature values must be evaluated based on the location of
   the weather station to see if they are representative of the total study
   area. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent relationships between groundwater conditions and topographic
   properties in small drainage basins would assist the study and modelling
   of basin hydrology and hydrochemistry. Hydrochemical simulation using
   topographically based models would benefit in particular from the
   linkage of groundwater residence times to topographic indices, such as
   the ln(a/tanbeta) index of Beven and Kirkby. Hypothesized associations
   between this index and groundwater characteristics were tested during
   the spring 2000 snowmelt in two sub-basins in the Turkey Lakes Watershed
   near Sault Ste Marie, ON. One sub-basin is in mature hardwood forest,
   and the other was clearcut in the fall of 1997. Piezometric surface
   elevations were monitored in each sub-basin throughout the melt, and the
   topographic index value for each piezometer was determined. The
   delta(18)O signatures of input water and groundwater were also measured.
   Mean groundwater residence times were obtained using the exponential
   system response function, which generally produced good fits to the
   observed groundwater delta(18)O time series in both sub-basins. There
   were significant contrasts in groundwater conditions between the
   sub-basins. The forested sub-basin exhibited higher and more temporally
   variable piezometric surface elevations and a greater contrast between
   8180 signatures and water residence times in shallow versus deeper
   groundwater relative to the harvested sub-basin. Patterns of groundwater
   residence times in the sub-basins were supported by pre-harvest
   groundwater chemistry; however, data from the two sub-basins largely
   failed to support the hypothesized relationships between groundwater
   conditions and topographic index values. Methodological limitations that
   may have precluded a more rigorous test of the hypotheses are reviewed,
   and the potential for using groundwater residence times to evaluate the
   impacts of forest harvesting on basin hydrochemistry is briefly
   discussed. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the importance of litter on forest floor albedo and brightness,
   previous studies have not documented forest floor albedo or litter cover
   in any detail. Our objective was to describe the seasonal influence of
   litter on spectral albedos and nadir reflectances of a forest snowpack
   in a mixed-hardwood stand in the Sleepers River Research Watershed
   (SRRW) in Danville, Vermont (37degrees39' N, 119degrees2' W).
   Experimental measurements in a nearby open area at the Snow Research
   Station of the SRRW nearly duplicated the spectral trend observed in the
   forest. Spectral albedo and nadir reflectance measurements in the
   visible and near infrared (350-2500 nm) transitioned from a gently
   curved shape through the visible range (for finer-grained, lightly
   littered snow) to one having a peak in the red/near-infrared (near 760
   nm) as the snowmelt season progressed (for coarser-grained, more heavily
   littered snow). The snowpack became optically thin as surface litter
   reached high percentages. A point-in-time digital photographic survey of
   the late-lying snowpacks of three forest stands and the open showed that
   median litter cover percentages in the coniferous, deciduous,
   mixed-forest, and an open area were 17.5, 6.1, 1.2, and 0.04
   respectively. A Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on ranks and pairwise comparisons
   using Dunn's test indicated that the litter covers of the three forest
   stands were significantly different with >95\% confidence. The snowpack
   was relatively shallow (<1 m), as is typical for this area of Vermont.
   From a remote-sensing standpoint, and since shallow snow and increased
   grain size also lower the, visible albedo, we can expect that snowpack
   litter will cause decreased albedo earlier in the snowmelt season, at
   deeper snow depths, and will tend to shift the maximum albedo peak to
   the red/NIR range as the melt season progresses. Published in 2001 by

Abstract = {{In this study, 10 years (1990-99) of summertime data collected at a
   representative sedge fen in the Hudson Bay Lowland (HBL) are used to
   investigate the energy and water balance dynamics of subarctic wetlands.
   The summertime climatic characteristics at the study site during the 10
   year study period are also examined. It is shown that mean cumulative
   summertime precipitation P-avg for the study decade closely approximates
   the 30 year mean P(av)g. However, the mean summertime air temperature
   T-avg for the study decade is 1 degreesC higher than the 30 year mean
   T-avg.
   To examine the energy and water balance dynamics at the study site, the
   variation in each of their respective components throughout the study
   decade is considered. Little variation is observed in cumulative
   summertime net radiation Q(cum){*} and cumulative summertime ground heat
   flux Q(Gcum),m; however, substantial year-to-year variation is evident
   in cumulative summertime water deficit WDcum, cumulative summertime
   precipitation P-cum, cumulative summertime sensible heat flux Q(Hcum),
   and cumulative summertime latent heat flux Q(Ecum). It is noted that the
   variability in Q(Ecum) is particularly significant because it consumes
   the largest proportion of the available summertime energy, and is the
   largest component of the summertime water balance at this subarctic
   wetland.
   Past research has suggested that Q{*}, P, and T have the most influence
   on summertime Q(E) at high-latitude wetlands. To test this hypothesis at
   our study sited Q(Ecum), P-cum, T-avg and Q(cum){*} from each year in
   the study decade were examined. It is observed that high Q(Ecum) is
   associated with high P-cum, T-avg and Q(cum){*} , and that low Q(Ecum)
   is associated with low P-cum and T-avg. To identify the
   hydroclimatological variables that are most responsible for controlling
   Q(Ecum) dynamics at the sedge fen, a stepwise linear regression was
   performed. This analysis indicates that P-cum and Q(cum){*} are the most
   u important hydroclimatological controls over Q(Ecum). However, it is
   demonstrated that the variability in P-cum is more responsible than the
   variability in Q(cum){*} for the variability in Q(Ecum) during the study
   decade because of its higher coefficient of variation. The results of
   this study have broader applicability to wetlands in other parts of the
   subarctic ecoregion, including the Mackenzie River Basin (MRB). For
   example, past studies have shown similarities in the energy balance
   regimes at wetland sites from the HBL and MRB. Copyright (C) 2001 John

Abstract = {{This paper considers the processes controlling the rapid drainage of
   ice-rich permafrost-dammed lakes. It is postulated that the primary
   process controlling lake drainage is the melting of ice-rich permafrost,
   in a manner similar to that controlling the drainage of glacier-dammed
   lakes. Two lakes are considered in the analysis: one that drained
   naturally over a period of less than 16 h, and Lake Illisarvik, which
   was experimentally drained in 1978. Preliminary analysis showed that the
   energy contained in the lake water was sufficient for melting the ice
   content of the resulting drainage channel for both study lakes.
   Discharge estimated using a glacier-dammed lake model developed by
   Clarke (Journal of Glaciology 1982; 28: 3) compared reasonably well with
   measured discharge during the period of rapid channel enlargement at
   Illisarvik, and resulted in the draining of Trail Valley Creek lake
   within the brief period indicated by a gauging station. These results
   suggest that melting of the ice-rich permafrost during drainage
   dominates at least the early stages of drainage. However, further work
   is required to consider the processes of mechanical erosion, which in
   some cases may dominate the later stages of drainage, and to consider
   the appropriateness of certain assumptions in the lake drainage model.

Abstract = {{The altitudinal distribution of a snow algal community was investigated
   on an Alaska glacier (Gulkana Glacier in the Alaska Range) from 1270 to
   1770 m a.s.l. Seven species of snow and ice algae (Chlorophyta and
   cyanobacteria) were observed on the glacier surface. These species were
   Chlamydomonas nivalis, Mesotaenium berggrenii, Ancylonema
   nordenskioldii, Cylindrocystis brebissonii, Raphidonema sp., and two
   Oscillatoriaceae cyanobacteria. The altitudinal distribution of snow
   algae was different among the species: Cd. nivalis was distributed on
   the middle to upper area, M. berggrenii; A. nordenskioldii, and one
   Oscillatoriaceae cyanobacterium on the middle to lower area; Raphidonema
   sp. on the middle area; and Cyl. brebissonii and one Oscillatoriaceae
   cyanobacterium on the lower area. The total cell concentration and the
   cell volume biomass of the snow algae ranged from 4.4 x 10(3) to 9.9 X
   10(5) cells ml(-1) and from 33 to 2211 mul m(-2) respectively. The cell
   volume biomass changed with altitude; the biomass increased with
   altitude below 1600 m a.s.l., and decreased above 1600 m a.s.l. The
   community structure showed thatA. nordenskioldii dominated on the lower
   part of the glacier, and that Cd. nivalis dominated on the upper part.
   The species diversity was relatively high at the lowest and middle
   sites. The pH was 4.7 to 5.3 for snow and 4.9 to 5.7 for ice on the
   glacier. The altitudinal distribution of snow algae is discussed in
   terms of the physical and chemical condition of the glacier surface, and
   is compared with that on a Himalayan glacier. A larger biomass in the
   snow area on the Alaska glacier than that of the Himalayan glacier is
   likely due to less frequent snow cover in summer in Alaska. Small
   amounts of filamentous cyanobacteria on the Alaska glacier may allow
   washouts of unicellular green algae by running melt water and may cause
   a different pattern of altitudinal distribution of algal biomass on the
   ice area from the Himalayan glacier. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{Since 1984, annual glacier mass balance measurements have been conducted
   on eight glaciers by the North Cascades Glacier Climate Project (NCGCP).
   Since 1993 the National Park Service (NPS) has monitored the mass
   balance of four glaciers, and the NCGCP an additional two glaciers. This
   14 glacier monitoring network, covering an area of 14000 km(2),
   represents the most extensive network of mass balance measurements for
   alpine glaciated areas in the world. The breadth of the record allows
   determination of the annual variability of annual balance from glacier
   to glacier, and from year to year.
   Data indicate a broad regional continuity in the response of these
   glaciers to climate. All cross-correlation values between any pair of
   the 14 glaciers ranged from 0.80 to 0.98. This strong degree of
   correlation indicates that regional-scale climate conditions, not local
   microclimates, are the primary control of glacier annual balance in the
   North Cascades.
   Data also indicate that the annual mass balance trend for glaciers was
   strongly negative from 1984 to 1994 and slightly positive from 1995 to
   2000. The cumulative annual mass balance for eight glaciers between 1984
   and 1994 was -0.39 m year(-1). From 1995 to 2000 the cumulative annual
   mass balance of the same eight glaciers was +0-10 m year(-1), and +0-15
   m year(-1) for all 14 glaciers in this study.
   The correlation coefficients indicate the strongly similar response, not
   that the specific magnitude of the annual mass balance for each glacier
   is the same. There is a significant annual range in the individual
   glacier balances, averaging 1.01 m, and in the mean annual mass balance
   between glaciers. All of the glaciers with more positive annual mass
   balances since 1995 had either significant accumulation areas extending
   above 2300 m, and/or are east of the zone of maximum precipitation. The
   glaciers with the most negative annual mass balance are those with the
   lowest mean elevation. The record is, as yet, too short to explain the
   variability of mass balance fully using climate data and seasonal mass
   balance data. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Although a great deal of research has focused on the hydrologic effects
   of climate variability and change, relatively little research has
   examined the effects on streamflow of interactions between climate
   variability and change and resulting glacier response. Place Glacier, in
   the southern Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Canada, has been
   monitored for mass balance since 1965, and a stream gauge was operated
   just below the glacier terminus from 1969 to 1989. This paper presents
   analyses of the mass balance history and streamflow variations in
   relation to recorded climatic variability.
   Place Glacier's winter and net balances are correlated with the Pacific
   Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Summer balance is positively correlated with
   summer temperature and negatively with the preceding winter balance,
   which enhances the effects of changes in winter balance on net balance.
   The well-documented post-1976 shift from the PDO cold phase to the
   present warm phase initiated a significant and persistent period of more
   negative net balance and terminal retreat. A reconstruction of net
   balance extending back to the 1890s, based on a regression with winter
   precipitation and summer temperature, displays decadal-scale
   fluctuations consistent with the PDO. Summer streamflow responded to
   interannual variations in winter snow accumulation and summer
   temperatures, which control the rate of rise of the glacier snowline and
   melt rates. After accounting for these influences via regression
   analysis, August streamflow displayed a negative trend in total runoff.
   Examination of air photographs and the reconstructed mass balance
   history suggest that significant firn depletion had occurred prior to
   1965, such that the dominant effect of glacier changes was a reduction
   in ice area, resulting in decreased meltwater production. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Twenty five laboratory dissolution experiments have been conducted to
   quantify rates of solute acquisition, measured as Ca2+ concentration
   against time, from glacigenic sediments suspended in cold, dilute
   waters. Suspended sediment character was constrained by field-calibrated
   ranges of both concentration in meltwater (g cm(-3)) and specific
   surface area by sediment mass (cm(2) g(-1)). This constraint yielded,
   for the first time in a glacier hydrochemical study, dissolution rate
   data as a function of the specific sediment surface area by water volume
   (cm(2) cm(-3)). The resulting experimental data are used to calibrate a
   kinetic dissolution model, where the rate of solute acquisition is
   considered in terms of three parameters: an initial concentration C-0,
   reflecting rapid ion-exchange reactions; an ultimate steady-state
   concentration C-s; and a rate parameter k. Results indicate an excellent
   fit between the laboratory-measured Ca2+ concentrations and model
   output, with goodness-of-fit, expressed as chi(2) reducing in all cases
   to less than 1.7 x 10(-14) following iterative curve fitting for each
   experiment. Plotting the resulting best-fit equation parameters against
   specific surface area by water volume reveals a strong positive
   relationship for both C-0 and C-s, respectively yielding straight-line
   slopes of 4.2 x 10(-8) (R-2 = 0.88) and 1.2 x 10(-7) (R-2 = 0.77).
   However, k was found to be insensitive to changes in specific surface
   area by water volume (R-2 = 0.00), largely reflecting the dominance of
   variability in C-0 and C-s in this model. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Major ion concentrations in meltwaters draining glacial environments
   have been widely reported. However, concentrations of minor and trace
   elements have received scant attention. This study presents trace and
   minor element variations in bulk meltwaters draining Haut Glacier
   d'Arolla (Switzerland) based on twice-daily sampling throughout the 1999
   ablation season, which represents the most detailed meltwater quality
   dataset to date. In order to assess the mode of export from the
   catchment, these elements are partitioned into (i) `dissolved' and (ii)
   `particulate-associated' minor and trace element components.
   A computer-based speciation model (PHREEQCi) was applied to the bulk
   meltwater data, suggesting that Ba, Be, Cd, Cu, Li, Rb and Sr exist
   primarily as mobile monovalent or divalent dissolved cations, which may
   be involved in interactions with suspended sediment surfaces.
   Conversely, the model predicts the precipitation of Fe, Al, Mn and Cr
   (oxi)hydroxides, suggesting these species may be predominantly
   transported as colloids, which may remove other minor and trace elements
   from solution by co-precipitation reactions.
   Laboratory leaching experiments on suspended sediments and fresh rock
   powder suggests that minor and trace element concentrations may also be
   influenced by (oxi)hydroxide precipitation and adsorption-desorption
   reactions with suspended sediment surfaces. The quantity and transport
   mode of trace and minor elements may influence their bioavailability
   downstream of glacierized headwater catchments. Further, the enrichment
   of many dissolved minor and trace elements in meltwaters compared with
   world stream-waters, coupled with the timing of water and sediment
   delivery during the summer months, may have implications for downstream
   aquatic environments. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The force on a `ploughmeter' and subglacial water pressure have been
   measured in the same borehole at Unteraar-gletscher, Switzerland, in
   order to investigate ice-sediment coupling and the motion at the base of
   a soft-bedded glacier. A strong inverse correlation of the recorded
   pressure and force fluctuations, in conjunction with a significant time
   lag between the two signals, suggests that pore-water pressures directly
   affect the strength of the subglacial sediment. The lag is interpreted
   to reflect the time required for the water-pressure wave to propagate
   through the pores of the sediment to the depth of the ploughmeter.
   Analysis of the propagation velocity of this pressure wave yielded an
   estimate of the hydraulic diffusivity, a key parameter necessary to
   characterize transient pore-water flow. Furthermore, the inferred
   inverse relationship between pore-water pressure and sediment strength
   implies that Coulomb-plastic deformation is an appropriate theological
   model for the sediment underlying Unteraargletscher. However, the
   sediment strength as derived from the ploughmeter data was found to be
   one order of magnitude smaller than that calculated for a
   Coulomb-frictional material using the water-pressure measurements. This
   significant discrepancy might result from pore-water pressures in excess
   of hydrostatic down-glacier from the ploughmeter. As the ploughmeter is
   dragged through the sediment, sediment is compressed. If the rate of
   this compression is large relative to the rate at which pore water can
   drain away, excess pore-water pressures will develop that have the
   potential to weaken the sediment. The same process could lead to highly
   fluid sediment down-glacier from clasts that protrude into the glacier
   sole and thus would otherwise provide the roughness to couple the
   glacier to its bed (Iverson, 1999). Rapidly sliding glaciers overlying
   sediments might therefore move predominantly by `ploughing', which tends
   to focus basal motion near the glacier sole rather than at depth in the
   bed. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Direct, in situ measurements of glacier mass balance are expensive.
   Remote sensing would be an attractive alternative if remotely observable
   quantities could be interpreted in terms of mass gain or loss. A system
   developed recently for the analysis of Radarsat browse images is used
   here to explore temporal and environmental controls of melting on
   glaciers on Axel Heiberg Island, Nunavut, Canada. The browse images have
   an effective spatial resolution of 2 km, are georeferenced to
   single-pixel accuracy, and number about 200 over the two study years,
   1998 and 1999. Surface melting in the accumulation zone is readily
   recognized by the contrast between bright frozen firn, which exhibits a
   microwave signal dominated by volume scattering from ice lenses and
   pipes, and dark wet firn, the signal from which is muted by either
   absorption or near-specular reflection at the surface. In the ablation
   zone, radar images, apart from showing the brief spring period of
   snowmelt, contain little information about the intensity or even the
   fact of melting. However, in the accumulation zone there is a definite
   dependence of brightness on temperature: at temperatures above freezing,
   the hotter it is the darker is the appearance of the glacier. This is
   most naturally (and encouragingly) interpreted as a relation between
   brightness and melting rate. Analysis of same-day image pairs shows
   that, as expected, the terrain slope and the aspect influence the radar
   brightness strongly and must therefore be allowed for in future
   modelling of the hydrology of ablation on glaciers. Copyright (C) 2001

Abstract = {{We examine the temporal evolution of snow distribution over first-year
   sea ice from late winter to the period when melt ponds form. Our
   objectives are to model snowmelt over first-year sea ice and investigate
   how melt rate affects the transmission of photosynthetically active
   radiation (PAR). These objectives are a subcomponent of a larger
   initiative to examine the coupling of physical and biological systems
   within a changing ocean-sea-ice-atmosphere system (Iacozza J, Barber.
   2000. C-ICE 2000 Field Summary. CEOSTEC-2000-12-01. CEOS, University of
   Manitoba).
   Results indicate that the melt rate for the snow cover is non-uniform
   both spatially and temporally, with decreasing rates for increasing snow
   depths. At depths greater than approximately 16 cm the melt rate is
   fairly consistent (approximately 3.5\% day(-1)). The melt rate was best
   modelled using a quadratic equation, accounting for 71.5\% of the
   variation in the melt rate. This melt-rate equation was used to estimate
   the evolution of a statistical snow surface based on Iacozza and Barber
   (1999. Atinosphere-Ocean 37: 21-51) and to examine the transmission of
   PAR through the melt period. Analysis of the PAR transmission indicated
   that, as the melt season progressed, a greater amount of PAR is
   transmitted through the snow and ice and that this transmission is
   controlled by the ablation rate of different thicknesses of snow. The
   variation in PAR over the study area also increased as the melt season
   progressed. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Brightness temperature T-B data were collected with a surface-based
   radiometer operating on both vertical and horizontal polarizations at
   frequencies of 19, 37, and 85 GHz. Both microwave emissions and
   thermophysical. data were collected as part of the
   Collaborative-Interdisciplinary Cryospheric Experiment between 15 May
   and 25 June 2000, in the Canadian High Arctic. Each season was
   characterized by a running variance of the time series in the microwave
   emissions. The seasonal analysis was conducted through observed changes
   in the physical characteristics of the sea ice and the overlying snow
   pack. Results from a k-means clustering analysis show that variability
   in the microwave response can be categorized into phenomenological
   states that were described by Livingstone et al. {[}IEEE Transactions on
   Geoscience and Remote Sensing 1987; 25(2): 174-187] as winter, early
   melt, melt onset and advanced melt. We describe the average
   thermophysical. conditions associated with each one of these `ablation
   states' and interpret the relative contributions of each to the observed
   microwave response. Emissivities were calculated and used as part of a
   descriptive analysis of the seasonal variation of TB. Our results
   confirm other findings that the strength and pattern of the relationship
   are frequency dependent and relative to snow and ice dielectric
   properties. Useful information on the, thermodynamic state of the
   snow-sea-ice system can be derived from passive microwave data, since
   the microwave emissions respond to the general seasonal changes
   associated with the transition from winter to a melt ponded sea ice
   surface. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The arctic environment, and in particular the Mackenzie Basin, displays
   a very dynamic interrelationship between the atmosphere and the surface
   for the different ecosystems represented. The Canadian Twin Otter
   research aircraft flew a total of 24 grid and long regional transects,
   over tundra, forest and delta ecosystems, during the period of snow melt
   (late May-early June) and early summer (early July) as part of the 1999
   Mackenzie Area GEWEX (Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment) Study
   (MAGS) field campaign. Observations over tundra showed a sharp rise in
   the sensible heat flux at the onset of melt, reaching a maximum at the
   end of the melting period similar to those observed in early summer. The
   latent heat flux showed a more gradual rise from snowmelt to early
   summer with a Bowen ratio (sensible heat/latent heat) of two during
   melt. The forested system demonstrated a similar gradual rise in the
   latent heat flux, whereas the sensible heat flux was already high with
   Bowen ratios reaching three at the start of the observation period in
   late May. The gradual rise in latent heat flux can be tied to gradual
   thawing of the root zone and the onset of photosynthesis activity. The
   relatively low solar elevation angle and earlier start of snow melt
   along the regional transect may account for the much larger sensible
   heat flux. An analysis of the turbulent coherent structures indicates
   that the spatial density of structures for both latent heat and sensible
   heat increases strongly with season, from snow melt into the early
   summer conditions. This has implications for sampling criteria and
   optimum flux averaging period.
   There are distinct differences in energy partitioning between the
   various arctic ecosystems. At the. beginning of the observation period,
   almost all the net radiation over the delta and tundra regions is
   utilized in non-turbulent form, whereas the forested areas use less than
   50\%. Model simulations of the ground heat flux showed observed diurnal
   imbalances and suggest that the magnitudes depend on the position of the
   permafrost table and may partially account for the large non-turbulent
   energy. Preliminary results from the Canadian MC2 model using the MAGS
   aircraft data for diagnosis and validation have identified sensitive
   model components that may merit further investigation. The findings from
   this study will help to fill gaps in our knowledge about
   surface-atmosphere interactions in arctic environments, particularly
   during snow melt, and broadens our contemporary view of
   evapotranspiration dynamics of wet surfaces. Copyright (C) 2001 John

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the derivation of the hydrological response of a
   hillslope on the assumption of quick runoff by surface runoff
   generation. By using the simple non-linear storage based model, first
   proposed by Horton, an analytical solution of the overland flow
   equations over a plane hillslope was derived. This solution establishes
   a generalization for different flow regimes of Horton's original
   solution, which is valid for the transitional flow regime only. The
   solution proposed was compared successfully with that of Horton and, for
   the turbulent flow regime, to the one derived from kinematic wave
   theory. This solution can be applied easily to both stationary and
   non-stationary rainfall excess events. An analytical solution for the
   instantaneous response function (IRF) was also derived. Finally, simple
   expressions to compute peak and time to peak of IRF are proposed.

Abstract = {{The performance of a constructed wetland for wastewater treatment was
   examined for four months (December 1995 to March 1996). The study area,
   hereby referred to as the Splash wetland, is approximately 0.5 ha, and
   is located in the southern part of Nairobi city. Splash wetland
   continuously receives domestic sewage from two busy restaurants. Treated
   wastewater is recycled for re-use for various purposes in the
   restaurants. Both wet and dry season data were analysed with a view of
   determining the impact of seasonal variation on the system performance.
   The physical and chemical properties of water were measured at a common
   intake and at series of seven other points established along the wetland
   gradient and at the outlet where the water is collected and pumped for
   re-use at the restaurants. The physico-chemical characteristics of the
   wastewater changed significantly as the wastewater flowed through the
   respective wetland cells. A comparison of wastewater influent versus the
   effluent from the wetland revealed the system's apparent success in
   water treatment, especially in pH modification, removal of suspended
   solids, organic load and nutrients mean influent pH = 5.7 +/- 0.5, mean
   effluent pH 7.7 +/- 0.3; mean influent BOD5 = 1603.0 +/- 397.6 mg/l,
   mean effluent BOD5 = 15.1 +/- 2.5 mg/l; mean influent COD = 3749.8 +/-
   206.8 mg/l, mean effluent COD = 95.6 +/- 17.2 mg/l; mean influent TSS =
   195.4 +/- 58.7 mg/l, mean effluent TSS = 4.7 +/- 1.9 mg/l. As the
   wastewater flowed through the wetland system dissolved free and saline
   ammonia, NH4+, decreased from 14.6 +/- 4.1 mg/l to undetectable levels
   at the outlet. Dissolved oxygen increased progressively through the
   wetland system. Analysis of the data available did not reveal temporal
   variation in the system's performance. However, significant spatial
   variation was evident as the wetland removed most of the common
   pollutants and considerably improved the quality of the water, making it
   safe for re-use at the restaurants. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Strategies for erosion control on a railway embankment batter (side
   slope) are quantitatively evaluated in this paper. The strategies were
   centred on control (`do nothing' treatment), grass seeding, gypsum
   application, jute mat (an erosion control blanket) placement and
   planting hedgerows of Monto vetiver grass. Rainfall and runoff were
   monitored at 1 min intervals on 10 m wide embankment batter plots during
   1998 and 1999. Total bedload and suspended sediment eroded from the
   plots were also measured but only for a group of storm events within
   sampling intervals. It has been demonstrated that vetiver grass is not
   cost-effective in controlling erosion on railway batters within Central
   Queensland region. Seeding alone could cause 60\% reduction in the
   erosion rate compared with the control treatment. Applying gypsum to the
   calcium-deficient soil before seeding yielded an additional 25\%
   reduction in the erosion rate. This is the result, primarily, of 100\%
   grass cover establishment within seven months of sowing. Therefore, for
   railway embankment batter erosion control, the emphasis needs to be on
   rapid establishment of 100\% grass cover. For rapid establishment of
   grass cover, irrigation is necessary during the initial stages of growth
   as the rainfall is unpredictable and the potential evaporation exceeds
   rainfall in the study region. The risk of seeds and fertilizers being
   washed out by short-duration and high-intensity rainfall events during
   the establishment phase may be reduced by the use of erosion control
   blankets on sections of the batters. Accidental burning of grasses on
   some plots caused serious erosion problems, resulting in very slow
   recovery of grass growth. It is therefore recommended that controlled
   burning of grasses on railway batters should be avoided to protect
   batters from being exposed to severe erosion. Copyright (C) 2001 John

Abstract = {{A recently developed approach to carbon isotope methodology (process
   recognition via isotope diagrams) is applied in a multidisciplinary
   study of precipitation-recharged aquifers of the lowlands-plains area of
   the Manawatu (south-west North Island). Urban and rural areas rely on
   groundwater from the upper levels of a deep basin sequence comprising
   marine and terrestrial sediments of Pleistocene age. Hydrochemical and
   isotopic (O-18, H-3, C-13 and C-14) data are merged with known details
   of geology and hydrogeology to reveal two separate confined aquifers
   within the depth range to 200 m. The shallower of these, below
   unconfined, locally recharged groundwater, is recharged on the foothills
   of the Ruahine Range to the north-east of the study area; flow direction
   is NE-SW. The deeper confined aquifer is recharged on the Tararua Range
   to the immediate east; flow direction essentially is transverse (SE-NW)
   to that in the shallower aquifer. Two processes are identified as
   dominant contributors to concentration and isotopic composition of
   dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), namely addition of CO2 from decay of
   organic materials and carbonate dissolution. Limitations of carbon
   isotope methods in determining residence times are illustrated by the
   data. Although the confined groundwater is essentially tritium-free,
   only a few samples showed conclusive evidence of significant ageing on
   the time-scale of C-14. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In the central part of the Bolivian Altiplano, the shallow groundwater
   presents electrical conductivities ranging from 0.1 to 20 mS/cm. In
   order to study the origin of this salinity pattern, a good knowledge is
   required of the geometry of the aquifer at depth. In this study,
   geophysics has been used to complement the sparse data available from
   drill holes. One hundred time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) soundings
   were carried out over an area of 1750 km(2). About 20 geological logs
   were available close to some of the TDEM soundings. Three intermediate
   results were obtained from the combined data: (i) the relationship
   between the electrical conductivity of the groundwater and the formation
   resistivity, (ii) geoelectrical cross-sections and (iii) geoelectrical
   maps at various depths. The limited data set shows a relationship
   between resistivity and the nature of the rock. From the cross-sections,
   a conductive substratum with a resistivity of less than 1 Omega (.)m was
   identified at most of the sites at depths ranging from 50 to 350 m. This
   substratum could be a clay-rich formation containing brines. Using
   derived relationships, maps of the nature of the formation (sandy,
   intermediate and clayey sediments) were established at depths of 10 and
   50 m. Discrimination between sand and clays was impossible where
   groundwater conductivity is high (>3 mS/cm). In the central part of the
   area, where the groundwater conductivity is low, sandy sediments are
   likely to be present from the surface to a depth of more than 200 m.
   Clayey sediments are more likely to be present in the south-east and
   probably constitute a hydraulic barrier to groundwater flow. In
   conclusion, the study demonstrates the efficiency of the TDEM sounding
   method to map conductive zones. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{An algorithm for estimating areal snowmelt infiltration into frozen
   soils is developed. Frozen soils are grouped into classes according to
   surface entry condition as: (a) Restricted-water entry is impeded by
   surface conditions, (b) Limited-capillary flow predominates and water
   entry is influenced primarily by soil physical properties, and (c)
   Unlimited-gravity flow predominates and most of the meltwater
   infiltrates. For Limited soils cumulative infiltration over time is
   estimated by a parametric equation from surface saturation. initial soil
   moisture content (water + ice), initial soil temperature and
   infiltration opportunity time. Total infiltration into Unlimited and
   Limited soils is constrained by the available water storage capacity.
   This constraint is also used to determine when Limited soils have
   thawed.
   The minimum spatial scale of the infiltration model is established for
   Limited soils by the variabilities in surface saturation, snow water
   equivalent, soil infiltrability, soil moisture (water + ice) and depth
   of soil freezing. Since snowmelt infiltration is influenced by other
   processes and factors that affect snow ablation, it is assumed that the
   infiltrability spatial scale should be consistent with the scales used
   to describe these variables. For open, northern, cold regions the
   following order in spatial scales is hypothesized: frozen ground greater
   than or equal to snowmelt greater than or equal to snow water equivalent
   greater than or equal to frozen soil infiltrability greater than or
   equal to soil moisture (water + ice) and snow water.
   For mesoscale application of the infiltration model it is recommended
   that the infiltrability scale be taken equal to the scale used to
   describe the areal extent and distribution of the water equivalent of
   the snowcover that covers frozen ground. Scaling the infiltrability of
   frozen soils in this manner allows one to exploit established
   landscape-stratification methodology used to derive snow accumulation
   means and distribution.
   Scaling of soil infiltrability at small scales (microscale) is
   complicated and requires information on the association(s) between the
   spatial distributions of soil moisture (water + ice) and snow water.
   A flow chart of the algorithm is presented. Copyright (C) 2001 John

Abstract = {{A hydrological study was conducted between 1997 and 1999 in the
   subalpine open woodland of the Wolf Creek Basin, Yukon, to assess the
   interslope water balance variability. The water balance during the
   snowmelt and summer periods on four hillslopes revealed strong contrasts
   in process magnitudes and highlighted important factors including frost,
   vegetation, soils and microclimate that Controlled vertical and lateral
   fluxes of water. Snow accounted for approximately half the annual water
   input, while differences in accumulation among hillslopes were related
   to interception properties of vegetation. Available energy at the snow
   surface controlled the melt sequence and the snow on some slopes
   disappeared up to two months earlier than others. Snowmelt runoff was
   confined to slopes with ice-rich substrates that inhibited deep
   percolation, with the runoff magnitude governed by the snow storage and
   the antecedent moisture of the desiccated organic soils prior to melt.
   During summer, evapotranspiration exceeded rainfall, largely sustained
   by water from the soil moisture reservoir recharged during the melt
   period. Differences in net radiation on slopes controlled the potential
   evapotranspiration. with the actual rates limited by the phenology of
   the deciduous forests and shrubs. Evapotranspiration was further
   suppressed on slopes where the organic soils became dry in late summer.
   Summer runoff was confined to slopes with porous organic layers
   overlying mineral soils to form a two-layer flow system: (1) quickflow
   in the surface organic layer and (2) slowflow in the mineral soil.
   Differences in the rates of flow were related to the position of the
   water table which may rise into the organic layer to activate quickflow.
   The presence of ice-rich frost and permafrost impeded vertical drainage
   and indirectly regulated the position of the water table. The location
   of the hillslope within a basin influenced recharge and discharge
   dynamics. Slope segments with large inflows sustained discharge
   throughout the summer to enhance basin runoff. In this way, the present
   study provides insight into basin hydrology. Copyright (C) 2001 John

Abstract = {{Temperate wetlands are generally net retainers of sulphate (SO4-2).
   However, recent research indicates that some wetlands may export SO4-2
   during drought conditions. In temperate wetlands, the susceptibility to
   drought will depend on wetland-stream and groundwater-surface water
   interactions. Here we present results of summer SO4-2 dynamics in a
   confined and unconfined stream within a temperate swamp.
   At the confined transect, the water table levels dropped greatly (-55
   cm) and groundwater flow patterns reversed in response to summer
   drought. Although high porewater SO4-2 concentrations (36.4 mg l(-1))
   were measured, no downstream export of SO4-2 was observed. A SO4-2 mass
   balance analysis on this stream reach indicated near zero retention. At
   the unconfined transect, water flowed from the stream to the wetland
   throughout most of the summer, maintaining relatively high water table
   levels (-25 cm). Sulphate porewater concentrations were significantly
   lower (9-2 mg l(-1)) than in the confined transect. Downstream discharge
   decreased to zero within this reach during extreme drought conditions,
   resulting in 100\% SO4-2 retention for a three-week period. Upon
   rewetting stream SO4-2 levels increased to 161.7 mg l(-1) resulting in a
   large net export Of SO4-2. This study demonstrates that while water
   table position was an important control on SO4-2 dynamics within the
   wetland, the degree of hydrologic connectivity between the wetland and
   the stream was the main control on episodic SO4-2 release following
   summer drought. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{At the Mer Bleue bog, Ontario, Canada, DOC export measured at the basin
   outflow was -8.3 +/- 3.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1), and DOC loading via
   precipitation was estimated to be 1.5 +/- 0.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1).
   Discharge and DOC export calculated using a Dupuit-Forchheimer
   approximation compared weil (within 1 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) to outflow
   estimates of DOC export. and confirmed that outflow measurements were a
   suitable proxy for DOC seepage at the peatland margins. DOC export was
   12\% of the magnitude of the residual carbon sink measured at the
   peatland. The {[}DOC] across groundwater transects decreased with depth,
   and {[}DOC] sampled below 0.75 m depths remained fairly constant over
   the study period. However, {[}DOC] exported through the acrotelm (0 to
   0.45 m peat depth) was variable, ranging from 40 mg l(-1) after snowmelt
   to 70 mg l(-1) during the growing season. Fluorescence analysis revealed
   that exported DOC was `allochthonous-like', whereas DOC in the catotelm
   (deeper layers of peat) became more `autochthonous-like' with depth. A
   conceptual model is developed to summarize the hydrological processes
   and controls which affect DOC biogeochemistry at the Mer Bleue.

Abstract = {{Global warming predicted by general circulation models (GCM) is now a
   more and more generally agreed upon effect. The impact of climate change
   on summer and fall flooding on the Cateauguay River Basin (2500 km(2)),
   located at the southern end of the Quebec province (Canada), was
   investigated using results from the Canadian GCM (CGCMI) and a coupled
   hydrology-hydraulics model of the basin. Three 20-year periods,
   corresponding to 1975-1995, 2020-2040 and 2080-2100, were used for the
   analysis. For each period, 24-h precipitation depths corresponding to
   the 20 and 100-year return periods were determined from a frequency
   analysis of the summer-fall maximum 24-h precipitations using a general
   extreme value frequency distribution. 24-h rainfall hyetographs were
   generated using region-specific cumulative distributions provided by the
   Canadian Atmospheric Environment Service. These hyetographs were then
   used as inputs to the hydrology-hydraulics model to simulate
   hydrographs, maximum discharge and maximum water levels at two sections
   of the river. Results indicate potentially very serious increases in the
   volume of runoff, maximum discharge and water level with future climate
   change scenarios. The changes get more drastic as longer return periods
   are considered. Increases of up to 250\% of the maximum water discharge
   are encountered and water levels are significantly higher than the
   current flood levels. If realistic, these scenarios indicate that
   important decisions will have to be taken to alleviate future increases
   in flooding damages in what is already a flood prone river. Copyright

Abstract = {{The headwaters of the Peace River, Canada became regulated in 1968 by a
   major hydroelectric facility and associated reservoir located in the
   Rocky Mountains. This paper examines the change to the downstream
   hydrographs that have resulted from regulation, To facilitate the
   comparison, a naturalized (without regulation effects) flow regime
   (1972-1996) was generated using a combination of hydrologic and
   hydraulic flow models. The results showed that even some 1100 km
   downstream, there have been significant changes to the hydrograph.
   Specifically, average winter flows were 250\% higher, annual peaks
   (1-day, 15-day, 30-day highs) were in the order of 35-39\% lower, and
   overall variability in daily flows decreased. Despite the reduction in
   peaks and variability, however, the downstream hydrograph is far from
   flat and has retained the basic shape of the pre-regulation hydrograph.
   This is primarily due to the strong influence of tributary inflow below
   the point of regulation. Recommendation for improvements to the model
   and future application of these data are also discussed. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Two indirect methods are used to detect evidence of intercepted
   subsurface flow (ISSF) by the road prism in the Pang Khum Experimental
   Watershed (PKEW) in northern Thailand. During the 12-month study period
   we failed to. observe a soil moisture change that corresponds with ISSF
   being generated by. the water table rising above the road surface. In
   support of the soil moisture data, delta O-18 signatures of rain water,
   road runoff, and stream water (a proxy for soil water) suggest Horton
   overland flow (HOF) generated on the road surface, not ISSF, is the
   dominant source of observed road runoff during typical rainfall events
   in the study area. This finding, which is contrary to the ISSF-dominant
   road runoff regime found typically on unpaved mountain roads in the US
   Pacific NW, suggests that the use of a HOF-based model to simulate
   runoff and sediment transport on unpaved roads in PKEW provides not only
   lower bound estimates of these processes, but realistic approximations
   for typical events. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A wettable surface layer overlying a water-repellent layer is commonly
   observed following a fire on a watershed. High surface temperatures
   `burn' off organic materials and create vapours that move downward in
   response to a temperature gradient and then condense on soil particles
   causing them to become water repellent. Water-repellent soils have a
   positive water entry pressure h(p) that must be exceeded or all the
   water will runoff. Water ponding depths h(o) that exceeds h(p) will
   cause infiltration. but the profile is not completely wetted.
   Infiltration rate and soil wetting increase as the value of h(o)/h(p),
   increases. The consequence is very high runoff, which also contributes
   to high erosion on fire-induced water-repellent soils during rain
   storms. Grass establishment is impaired by seeds being eroded and lack
   of soil water for seeds that do remain and germinate. Extrapolation of
   these general findings to catchment or watershed scales is difficult
   because of the very high temporal and spatial variabilities that occur
   in the field. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Fire-induced soil hydrophobicity is presumed to be a primary cause of
   the observed post-fire increases in runoff and erosion from forested
   watersheds in the Colorado Front Range, but the presence and persistence
   of hydrophobic conditions has not been rigorously evaluated. Hence the
   goals of this study were to: (1) assess natural and fire-induced soil
   hydrophobicity in the Colorado Front Range, and (2) determine the effect
   of burn severity, soil texture, vegetation type, soil moisture, and time
   since burning on soil hydrophobicity.
   Five wild and prescribed fires ranging in age from 0 to 22 months were
   studied. Each fire had four study sites in ponderosa pine forest, that
   had been burned at high, moderate, or low severity, and three sites were
   in unburned areas. Additional sites were established in lodgepole pine
   stands and an area with unusually coarse-textured soils. At each site
   the soil hydrophobicity was assessed in two pits using the water drop
   penetration time (WDPT) and the critical surface tension (CST).
   Measurements were made at the mineral soil surface and depths of 3, 6,
   9, 12, 15, and 18 cm.
   In sites burned at moderate or high severity the soils were often
   strongly hydrophobic at 0. 3, and 6 cm. Unburned sites or sites burned
   at low severity were typically hydrophobic only at the surface. Although
   soil hydrophobicity generally strengthened with increasing burn
   severity, statistically significant differences in soil hydrophobicity
   were difficult to detect because of the high variability within and
   between sites. Hydrophobicity also increased with increasing percent
   sand and was not present when soil moistures exceeded 12-25\%. There
   were no significant differences in soil hydrophobicity between ponderosa
   and lodgepole pine stands, regardless of burn severity.
   Repeat measurements on one fire suggest a weakening of fire-induced soil
   hydrophobicity after 3 months. Comparisons between fires suggest that
   fire-induced soil hydrophobicity persists for at least 22 months.
   Overall, CST values were more consistent and more highly correlated with
   the independent variables than the WDPT, and the CST is recommended for
   assessing soil hydrophobicity rather than the more commonly used WDPT.

Abstract = {{Steady-state infiltration measurements were made at mountainous sites in
   New Mexico and Colorado, USA, with volcanic and granitic soils after
   wildfires and at comparable unburned sites. We measured infiltration in
   the New Mexico volcanic soils under two vegetation types, ponderosa pine
   and mixed conifer, and in the Colorado granitic soils under ponderosa
   pine vegetation. These measurements were made within high-severity burn
   areas using a portable infiltrometer with a 0.017 m(2) infiltration area
   and artificial rainfall rates ranging from 97 to 440 mm h(-1).
   Steady-state infiltration rates were less at all burned sites relative
   to unburned sites. The volcanic soil with ponderosa pine vegetation
   showed the greatest difference in infiltration rates with a ratio of
   steady-state infiltration rate in burned sites to unburned soils equal
   to 0.15. Volcanic soils with mixed conifer vegetation had a ratio
   (burned to unburned soils) of at most 0.38, and granitic soils with
   ponderosa pine vegetation had a ratio of 0.38. Steady-state infiltration
   rates on unburned volcanic and granitic soils with ponderosa pine
   vegetation are not statistically different. We present data on the
   particle-size distribution at all the study sites and examples of
   wetting patterns produced during the infiltration experiments. Published

Abstract = {{Wildfire is a major ecological process and management issue on western
   rangelands. The impacts of wildfire on hydrologic processes such as
   infiltration, runoff, and erosion are not well understood. Small-plot
   rainfall simulation methods were applied in a rangeland wildfire setting
   to determine post-fire hydrologic response. Infiltration and interrill
   erosion processes were measured immediately post-fire and one year
   following the 1999 34 400 ha Denio fire in northwestern Nevada.
   Plot-scale spatial and temporal variability in fire impacts was compared
   with adjacent unburned areas. An index of water repellency was derived
   and used to quantify the influence of water-repellent soil conditions on
   infiltration. Results indicate the impact of the fire on infiltration
   was localized primarily on coppice microsites directly under shrubs
   characterized by high surface litter accumulations. Coppice microsites
   had very uniform fire-induced soil water repellency with 29 of 30 plots
   exhibiting at least a 10\% reduction in initial infiltration with an
   average 28\% reduction. Cumulative erosion was nearly four times higher
   on burned coppices compared with unburned coppices. The impact of the
   fire on infiltration and erosion was reduced, but still evident, 1 year
   after fire. Significant temporal variability in infiltration between
   years was observed on both burned and unburned areas, complicating the
   interpretation of fire impacts and hydrologic recovery following
   wildfire. Published in 2001 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Simulating overland flow following wildfire: mapping vulnerability to
   landscape disturbance}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{2917-2930}},

Abstract = {{The probability of landscape-scale disturbances such as fire are
   expected to increase in the future due to anticipated climate changes
   and past land management practices. These disturbances can produce
   dramatic changes in hydrologic responses (e,g. overland flow) that can
   pose risks to human life, infrastructure, and the environment. Assessing
   these risks and associated remediation strategies requires spatially
   explicit evaluation of upland hydrology. However, most current
   evaluation methods focus on a specified location within a watershed,
   precluding estimation of spatially distributed, upland, hydrological
   response; and those that do consider spatial variability usually do not
   account for redistribution of overland flow among adjacent subunits.
   Here we highlight the use of a spatially distributed model for assessing
   spatial changes in upland hydrologic response following landscape-scale
   disturbance. Using a distributed model called SPLASH (Simulator for
   Processes of Landscapes: Surface/Subsurface Hydrology), we simulated
   pre- and post-fire scenarios based on the Cerro Grande fire (Los Alamos,
   NM, USA; May 2000) over 17 300 ha (resolution of 30 m x 30 m) for 2 year
   and 100 year design storms. For the 2 year storm, maximum overland flow
   rates for burned cells in the post-fire scenario greatly exceeded those
   for pre-fire conditions (modes: pre-fire, 3.25 x 10(-10) m(3) s(-1);
   post-fire, 7.0 x 10(-10) m(3) s(-1)). For the 100 year storm, maximum
   overland flow was much greater than for the 2 year storm (modal
   pre-fire: 31.8 x 10(10) m(3) s(-1)), with the difference between pre-
   and post-fire simulations being less dramatic (modal post-fire: 48.6 x
   10(-10) m(3) s(-1)). Mapped differences between pre- and post-fire
   provide a means for prioritizing upland areas for remediation using an
   approach that accounts not only for topography. soils, and plant cover,
   but also for the redistribution of overland flow. More generally, our
   results highlight the potential utility of spatially distributed models
   to focus and prioritize rehabilitation efforts for future assessments of
   risk following landscape-scale disturbance. Copyright (C) 2001 John

Abstract = {{Wildfires in the Colorado Front Range can trigger dramatic increases in
   runoff and erosion. A better understanding of the causes of these
   increases is needed to predict the effects of future wildfires, estimate
   runoff and erosion risks front prescribed fires. and design effective
   post-fire rehabilitation treatments. The objective of this project was
   to determine whether runoff and sediment yields were significantly
   related to the site variables of burn severity, percent cover, soil
   water repellency. soil moisture, time since burning, and slope. To
   eliminate the variability due to natural rainfall events, we applied an
   artificial storm of approximately 80 mm h(-1) on 26 1 m(2) plots in the
   summer and fall of 2000, The plots were distributed among a June 2000
   wildfire, a November 1999 prescribed fire, and a July 1994 wildfire.
   For 23 of the 26 plots the ratio of runoff to rainfall exceeded 50\%.
   Nearly all sites exhibited strong natural or fire-induced water
   repellency, so the runoff ratios were only 15-30\% larger for the
   high-severity plots in the two more recent fires than for the unburned
   or low-severity plots, The two high-severity plots in the 1994 wildfire
   had very low runoff ratios., and this probably was due to the high soil
   moisture conditions at the time of the simulated rainfall and the
   resulting reduction in the natural water repellency. Sediment yields
   from the high-severity sites in the two more recent fires were 10-26
   times greater than the unburned and low-severity plots. The plots burned
   at high severity in 1994 yielded only slightly more sediment than the
   unburned plots. Percent ground cover explained 81\% of the variability
   in sediment yields, and the sediment yields from the plots in the 1994
   wildfire are consistent with the observed recovery in percent ground
   cover. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Rainfall simulations allow for controlled comparisons of runoff and
   erosion among ecosystems and land cover conditions. Runoff and erosion
   can increase greatly following fire, yet there are few rainfall
   simulation studies for post-fire plots, particularly after severe fire
   in semiarid forest. We conducted rainfall simulations shortly after a
   severe fire (Cerro Grande) in ponderosa pine forest near Los Alamos, New
   Mexico, USA, which completely burned organic ground cover and exposed
   unprotected soil. Measurements on burned plots showed 74\% of mineral
   soil was exposed compared with an estimated 3\% exposed prior to the
   fire. Most of the remaining 26\% surface area was covered by easily
   moveable ash. Rainfall was applied at 60 mm h(-1) in three repeated
   tests over 2 days. Runoff from burned plots was about 45\% of the total
   120 mm of applied precipitation, but only 23\% on the unburned plots.
   The most striking difference between the response of burned and unburned
   plots was the amount of sediment production; burned plots generated 25
   times more sediment than unburned plots (76 kg ha(-1) and 3 kg ha(-1)
   respectively per millimetre of rain). Sediment yields were well
   correlated with percentage bare soil (r = 0.84). These sediment yields
   were more than an order of magnitude greater than nearly all comparable
   rainfall simulation studies conducted on burned plots in the USA, most
   of which have been in grasslands or shrublands. A synthesis of
   comparable studies suggests that an erosion threshold is reached as the
   amount of soil exposed by fire increases to 60-70\%. Our results provide
   sediment yield and runoff data from severely burned surfaces, a
   condition for which little rainfall simulation data exist. Further, our
   results contrast post-fire hydrologic responses in forests with those in
   grasslands and shrublands. These results can be applied to problems
   concerning post-fire erosion, flooding, contaminant transport, and
   development of associated remediation strategies. Copyright (C) 2001

Abstract = {{A combined ArcView GIS-HEC modelling application for floodplain analysis
   of pre- and post-burned watersheds is described. The burned study area
   is located on Pajarito Plateau near Los Alamos National Laboratory (the
   Laboratory), where the Cerro Grande Wildfire burned 42 878 acres (17 352
   ha) in May 2000. This area is dominated by rugged mountains that are
   dissected by numerous steep canyons having both ephemeral and perennial
   channel reaches. Vegetation consists of pinon-juniper woodlands located
   between 6000 and 7000 ft (1829-2134 m) above mean sea level (MSL). and
   Ponderosa pine stands between 7000 and 10000 ft MSL (2134-3048 m).
   Approximately 17\% of the burned area is located within the Laboratory,
   and the remainder is located in upstream or adjacent watersheds.
   Pre-burn floodplains were previously mapped in 1990-91 using early HEC
   models as part of the hazardous waste site permitting process.
   Precipitation and stream gauge data provide essential information
   characterizing rainfall-runoff relationships before and after the fire.
   They also provide a means of monitoring spatial and temporal changes as
   forest recovery progresses. The 2000 summer monsoon began in late June
   and provided several significant runoff events for model calibration.
   HEC-HMS modelled responses were sequentially refined so that observed
   and predicted hydrograph peaks were matched at numerous channel
   locations. The 100 year, 6 h design storm was eventually used to predict
   peak hydrographs at critical sites. These results were compared with
   pre-fire simulations so that new flood-prone areas could be
   systematically identified. Stream channel cross-sectional geometries
   were extracted from a gridded I ft (0.3 m) digital elevation model (DEM)
   using ArcView GIS. Then floodpool topwidths, depths, and flow velocities
   were remapped using the HEC-RAS model. Finally, numerous surveyed
   channel sections were selectively made at crucial sites for DEM
   verification. These evaluations provided timely guidance that influenced
   the decision to construct several flood detention structures that were
   completed in September 2000. Published in 2001 by John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Wildfire alters the hydrologic response of watersheds, including the
   peak discharges resulting from subsequent rainfall, Improving
   predictions of the magnitude of flooding that follows wildfire is needed
   because of the increase in human population at risk in the
   wildland-urban interface. Because this wildland-urban interface is
   typically in mountainous terrain, we investigated rainfall-runoff
   relations by measuring the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity and the
   unit-area peak discharge (peak discharge divided by the area burned) in
   three mountainous watersheds (17-26.8 km(2)) after a wildfire.
   We found rainfall-runoff relations that relate the unit-area peak
   discharges to the maximum 30 min rainfall intensities by a power law.
   These rainfall-runoff relations appear to have a threshold value for the
   maximum 30 min rainfall intensity (around 10 mm h(-1)) such that, above
   this threshold, the magnitude of the flood peaks increases more rapidly
   with increases in intensity. This rainfall intensity could be used to
   set threshold limits in rain gauges that are part of an early-warning

Abstract = {{A profile-based, analytical hillslope erosion model (HEM) is integrated
   into a geographical information system (GIS) framework to provide a tool
   to assess the impact of the Cerro Grande fire on erosion and sediment
   delivery to the many streams draining the burn area. The model, HEM-GIS,
   calculates rill and interrill erosion, transport and deposition along
   digital flow-pathways generated with GIS software. This new erosion and
   sediment yield technology accounts for complex terrain attributes and
   their impact on the connectivity of sediment transport pathways from
   source areas to streams. GIS digital spatial data, including elevation,
   vegetation cover, burn severity and soil type, are used as input to the
   model. Output includes spatially distributed predictions of total
   event-based sediment yield (tonnes or kilograms per square metre). Here
   the model is applied across an 800 km(2) region of the Pajarito Plateau
   watershed to assess the sedimentation risks associated with a 100 year
   design rain event. Although unvalidated for the design storm, the model
   predicts that the fire may cause runoff to increase by three to six
   times, and sediment yield to increase by more than an order of
   magnitude, Published in 2001 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we examine factors that pertain to the generation of
   debris flows from a basin recently burned by wildfire. Throughout the
   summer 2000 thunderstorm season, we monitored rain gauges, channel
   cross-sections, hillslope transects, and nine sediment-runoff traps
   deployed in a steep, 0.15 km(2) basin burned by the May 2000 Cerro
   Grande fire in New Mexico. Debris flows were triggered in the monitored
   basin during a rainstorm on July 16, 2000, in response to a maximum 30
   min rainfall intensity of 31 mm h(-1) (return period of approximately 2
   years). Eleven other storms occurred before and after the July storm
   these storms resulted in significant runoff, but did not generate debris
   flows.
   The debris flows generated by the July 16 storm initiated on a broad,
   open hillslope as levee-lined rills, The levees were composed of gravel-
   and cobble-sized material supported by an abundant fine-grained matrix.
   Debris-flow deposits were observed only on the hillslopes and in the
   first and second-order drainages of the monitored basin. No significant
   amounts of channel incision were measured following the passage of the
   debris flows, indicating that most of the material in the flows
   originated from the hillslopes.
   Sediment-runoff concentrations of between 0.23 and 0.81 kg 1(-1) (with a
   mean of 0.42 kg 1(-1)) were measured from the hillslope traps following
   the debris-flow-producing storm, These concentrations, however, were not
   unique to the July 16 storm. The materials entrained by the July 16
   storm contained a higher proportion of silt- plus clay-sized materials
   in the <2 mm fraction than the materials collected from storms that
   produced comparable sediment-runoff concentrations but not debris flows.
   The difference in materials demonstrates the critical role of the
   availability of fine-grained wood ash mantling the hillslopes in the
   runoff-dominated generation of post-wildfire debris flows. The highest
   sediment-runoff concentrations, again not unique to debris-flow
   production, were produced from maximum 30 min rainfall intensities
   greater than 20 mm h(-1). Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In late December 1996, the South Fork Payette River basin in
   west-central Idaho experienced a prolonged storm that culminated on
   January 1. 1997, with intense rain on melting snow that triggered slide
   failures, producing debris flows and sediment-charged floods. Failures
   occurred in saturated, cohesionless. grussy colluvium derived from
   Weathered Idaho batholith granitic rocks. Many failures along the South
   Fork Payette River originated in ponderosa pine forests burned in the
   1989 stand-replacing Lowman fire. An example is the 0.49 km(2) `Jughead'
   Creek basin. where a single large colluvial failure produced almost 40\%
   of the total volume eroded from the basin and generated a massive and
   rapid debris flow. Failures also occurred in steep, unburned. and
   unforested drainages such as Hopkins Creek. In this south-facing 0.58
   km(2) basin, 15 colluvial hollows failed. but no single failure produced
   more than 10\% of the total eroded volume. Sediment transport in Hopkins
   Creek occurred by prolonged sediment-charged sheetflooding. Despite
   vegetation differences, sediment yields from the geomorphically similar
   Hopkins Creek (similar to 42 000 Mg km(-2)) and Jughead Creek (similar
   to 44 000 Mg km(-2)) basins were quite similar. These 1997 erosion
   events are equivalent to several thousand years of sediment yield at low
   rates (2.7-30 Mg km(2) year(-1)) measured by short-term sediment
   trapping and gauging in Idaho batholith watersheds. If similar large
   events were solely responsible for sediment export. recurrence intervals
   (Rls) of several hundred years would account for higher sediment yields
   averaged over similar to 10(4) year from Idaho batholith watersheds.
   Dating of small fire-induced sheetflooding events in an early Holocene
   tributary junction fan of Jughead Creek indicates that frequent small
   sedimentation events (RI approximate to 33-80 year) occurred between
   7400 and 6600 cal year BP. with an average yield not greatly exceeding
   16 Mg km(-2) year(-1). Compared with the Holocene average, erosion rates
   during that 800 year period were unusually low, suggesting that sediment
   yields have not been constant over time, and that climatic variations
   and related fire regime changes may exert a strong influence on the
   probability of major erosional events, Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Stratigraphic and geomorphic evidence indicate floods that occur soon
   after forest fires have been intermittent but common events in many
   mountainous areas during the past several thousand years. The magnitude
   and recurrence of these post-fire flood events reflects the joint
   probability between the recurrence of fires and the recurrence of
   subsequent rainfall events of varying magnitude and intensity. Following
   the May 1996 Buffalo Creek, Colorado, forest fire, precipitation amounts
   and intensities that generated very little surface runoff outside of the
   burned area resulted in severe hillslope erosion, floods, and streambed
   sediment entrainment in the rugged, severely burned, 48 km(2) area.
   These floods added sediment to many existing alluvial fans, while
   simultaneously incising other fans and alluvial deposits. Incision of
   older fans revealed multiple sequences of fluvially transported sandy
   gravel that grade upward into charcoal-rich, loamy horizons. We
   interpret these sequences to represent periods of high sediment
   transport and aggradation during floods, followed by intervals of
   quiescence and relative stability in the watershed until a subsequent
   fire occurred.
   An alluvial sequence near the mouth of a tributary draining a 0-82 km(2)
   area indicated several previous post-fire flood cycles in the watershed.
   Dendrochronologic and radiocarbon ages of material in this deposit span
   approximately 2900 years, and define three aggradational periods. The
   three general aggradational periods are separated by intervals of
   approximately nine to ten centuries and reflect a `millennium-scale'
   geomorphic response to a closely timed sequence of events: severe and
   intense, watershed-scale, stand-replacing fires and subsequent
   rainstorms and flooding. Millennium-scale aggradational units at the
   study site may have resulted from a scenario in which the initial runoff
   from the burned watershed transported and deposited large volumes of
   sediment on downstream alluvial surfaces and tributary fans. Subsequent
   storm runoff may have produced localized incision and channelization.
   preventing additional vertical aggradation on the sampled alluvial
   deposit for several centuries. Two of the millennium-scale aggradational
   periods at the study site consist of multiple gravel and loam sequences
   with similar radiocarbon ages. These closely dated sequences may reflect
   a `multidecade-scale' geomorphic response to more frequent. but aerially
   limited and less severe fires, followed by rainstorms of relatively
   common recurrence. Published in 2001 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire usually promotes Hooding and accelerated erosion in upland
   watersheds. In the summer of 1999, a high-severity wildfire burned a
   series of mixed pine/oak headwater catchments in the San Jacinto
   Mountains of southern California. Log erosion barriers (LEBs) were
   constructed across much of the burned area as an erosion control
   measure. We built debris basins in two watersheds, each about I ha in
   area, one with LEBs, the other without, to measure post-fire hydrologic
   response and sediment yield and to evaluate the effectiveness of the
   LEBs. The watersheds are underlain by granitic bedrock, producing a
   loamy sand soil above large extents of weathered bedrock and exposed
   core stones (tors) on the surface. Measured soil water-repellency was
   similar over the two catchments. Rain gauges measured 348 mm of
   precipitation in the first post-fire year. The ephemeral stream channels
   experienced surface flow after major rainstorms. and the source of the
   water was throughflow exfiltration at the slope/channel interface.
   Post-fire overland flow produced some rilling, but hillslope erosion
   measured in silt fences away from any LEBs was minor, as was sediment
   accumulation behind the LEBs. Stream channels in the catchments
   exhibited minor net scour. Water yield was much greater in the
   LEB-treated watershed. This resulted in 14 times more sediment yield by
   weight than the untreated watershed. Average soil depths determined by
   augering were nearly double in the catchment without the LEBs compared
   with the treated watershed. This suggests that differences in water and
   sediment yield between the two catchments are due to the twofold
   difference in the estimated soil water-holding capacity in the untreated
   watershed. It appears that the deeper soils in the untreated watershed
   were able to retain most of the precipitation, releasing less Water to
   the channels and thereby reducing erosion and sediment yield. Thus, the
   test of LEB effectiveness was inconclusive in this study, because soil
   depth and soil water-holding capacity may have masked their performance.

Abstract = {{The stochastic-conceptual rainfall-runoff simulator (SCRRS) developed by
   R. A. Freeze in 1980 was used in this study to demonstrate
   quantitatively the interplay of the factors that control the occurrence
   of overland flow by the Horton and Dunne mechanisms. The simulation
   domain and input data for the SCRRS simulations reported here were
   abstracted from the R-5 catchment (Chickasha, OK) data sets. The results
   illustrate that the identification of a dominant hydrological response
   process may not be as simple as a singular Horton or Dunne
   characterization. The SCRRS simulations show that the Horton and Dunne
   processes can (i) occur simultaneously at different locations during a
   given rainfall event, (ii) change from one process to the other with
   time depending on the characteristics of the rainfall event, and (iii)
   be strongly dependent on the initial conditions. Copyright (C) 2001 John

Abstract = {{Small-scale experiments have demonstrated that forest clearance leads to
   an increase in water yield, but it is unclear if this result holds for
   larger river basins (> 1000 km(2)). No widespread changes in rainfall
   totals and patterns were found in the 12100 km(2) Nam Pong catchment in
   northeast Thailand between 1957 and 1995, despite a reduction in the
   area classified as forest from 80\% to 27\% in the last three decades.
   Neither were any detectable changes found in any other water balance
   terms nor in the dynamics of the recession at the end of the rainy
   season. When a hydrological model calibrated against data from the
   period before the deforestation was applied for the last years of the
   study period (1987-1995), runoff generation was however underestimated
   by approximately 15\%, indicating increased runoff generation after the
   deforestation. However, this was mainly due to the hydrological response
   during one single year in the first period, when the Q/P ratio was very
   low. When excluding this year, neither analysis based on the
   hydrological model could reveal any significant change of the water
   balance due to the deforestation. More detailed land-use analysis
   revealed that shade trees were left on agricultural plots as well as a
   number of abandoned areas where secondary growth can be expected, which
   is believed to account for the results. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Alpine/subalpine basins may exhibit substantial variability in solute
   fluxes despite many apparent similarities in basin characteristics. An
   evaluation of controls on spatial patterns in solute fluxes may allow
   development of predictive tools for assessing basin sensitivity to
   outside perturbations such as climate change or deposition of
   atmospheric pollutants. Relationships between basin physical
   characteristics, determined from geographical information system (GIS)
   tools, and solute fluxes and mineral weathering rates were explored for
   nine alpine/subalpine basins in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado,
   using correlation analyses for 1993 arid 1994 data. Stream-water nitrate
   fluxes were correlated positively with basin characteristics associated
   with the talus environment; i.e., the fractional amounts of steep slopes
   (greater than or equal to 30 degrees), unvegetated terrain and young
   debris (primarily Holocene till) in the basins, and were correlated
   negatively with fractional amounts of subalpine meadow terrain.
   Correlations with nitrate indicate the importance of the talus
   environment in promoting nitrate flux and the mitigating effect of areas
   with established vegetation, such as subalpine meadows. Total mineral
   weathering rates for the basins ranged from about 300 to 600 mot ha(-1)
   year Oligoclase weathering accounted for 30 to 73\% of the total mineral
   weathering flux, and was positively correlated with the amount of old
   debris (primarily Pleistocene glacial till) in the basins. Although
   calcite is found in trace amounts in bedrock, calcite weathering
   accounted for tip to 44\% of the total mineral weathering flux. Calcite
   was strongly correlated with steep slope, unvegetated terrain, and young
   debris-probably because physical weathering in steep-gradient areas
   exposes fresh mineral surfaces that contain calcite for chemical
   weathering. Oligoclase and calcite weathering are the dominant sources
   of alkalinity in the basins. However, atmospherically deposited acids
   consume much of the alkalinity generated by weathering of calcite and
   other minerals in the talus environment. Published in (C) 2001 by John

   variety of purposes in water resource management. The equilibrium
   temperature approach provides a means of taking into account the heat

   Kempton Park, UK. The evaporation and water temperature predicted by the
   model are in good agreement with the measurements. The mean annual
   evaporation is predicted to almost the same accuracy as the
   measurements. Estimates of the monthly predicted evaporation have root
   mean square errors about three times those of the measurements. The
   error in the mean annual evaporation estimated without taking the heat

Pages = {{2779-2796}},

Abstract = {{To examine the impact of tree species on the water cycle in a wet
   tropical region, annual evapotranspiration (ET) was estimated in Costa
   Rican plantations of three native, broad-leaved tree species that
   contrasted strongly in leaf size, leaf area and phenology.
   Evapotranspiration was estimated using the Penman-Monteith equation for
   transpiration from the dry canopy, the equilibrium equation for
   evaporation from the understory and a modified Rutter model of
   interception for evaporation of water from the canopy when wetted by
   rainfall. Canopy conductance was estimated from stomatal conductance,
   leaf area and leaf boundary-layer conductance; canopy storage capacity
   and filling rate were estimated from throughfall measurements.
   Micrometeorological instruments were mounted on a scaffolding tower.
   Mean stomatal conductance, which ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 mol m(-2) s(-1),
   was similar to boundary-layer conductance, 0.1 to 0.5 mol m(-2) s(-1),
   indicating decoupling of stomata from atmospheric conditions. Mean
   canopy conductance varied from 0.6 to 0.7 mol m(-2) s(-1) in the 1994
   wet season then dropped to 0.3-0.-1 mol m(-2) s(-1) in stands of the two
   deciduous species. Cordia and Cedrela, as a result of reduced leaf area
   during the dry season. Despite increased understory evaporation,
   dry-season ET from these stands was only 78-81\% of ET in stands of the
   evergreen species. Hyeronima. Maximum canopy water depth varied from 0.2
   to 2.2 mm, causing modelled interception to vary from 6\% to 25\% of
   annual ET. Higher dry-season transpiration rates along with high rates
   of evaporation of intercepted rainfall in all seasons led to 14\% higher
   annual ET in Hyeronima stands (1509 mm) than in stands of the species
   with lowest ET, Cedrela (1318 mm). Despite lack of strong physiological
   control on transpiration, tree species in wet tropical plantations can
   influence hydrological balance. Copyrights (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons.

Abstract = {{A numerical model (sediment trap efficiency for small ponds-STEP) is
   developed to simulate sediment deposition in small ponds (i.e. < 1 ha)
   and to calculate the sediment trap efficiency (STE). The algorithms are
   kept simple to allow the model to simulate larger time periods (i.e.
   several years). Eight runs with an experimental pond were executed to
   test the model. The STEP model produces reasonable predictions of STE as
   well as the shape and magnitude of the effluent sediment concentration
   graph. The model efficiency of STEP for the prediction of STE equals
   0.38 and the root mean square error equals 4.7\%. Similar models, such
   as DEPOSITS and CSTRS, were inefficient in predicting the experimental
   results. The STEP model was used to simulate the long-term (33 years)
   STE of small retention ponds in central Belgium using 10-min rainfall
   data. For a typical pond (1000 m(-2)) with a catchment area of 25 ha,
   annual STE can vary from 58 to 100\%, with a long-term STE of only 68\%.

Abstract = {{Generally, forest transpiration models contain model parameters that
   cannot be measured independently and therefore are tuned to fit the
   model results to measurements. Only unique parameter estimates with high
   accuracy can be used for extrapolation in time or space. However,
   parameter identification problems may occur as a result of the
   properties of the data set. Time-series of environmental conditions,
   which control the forest transpiration, may contain periods with
   redundant or coupled information, so called collinearity, and other
   combinations of conditions may be measured only with difficulty or
   incompletely. The aim of this study is to select environmental
   conditions that yield a unique parameter set of a canopy conductance
   model. The parameter identification method based on localization of
   information (PIMLI) was used to calculate the information content of
   every individual artificial transpiration measurement. It is concluded
   that every measurement has its own information with respect to a
   parameter. Independent criteria were assessed to localize the
   environmental conditions, which contain measurements with most
   information. These measurements were used in separate subdata sets to
   identify the parameters. The selected measurements do not overlap and
   the accuracies of the parameter estimates are maximized. Measurements
   that were not selected do not contain additional information that can be
   used to further maximize the parameter accuracy. Thereupon, the
   independent criteria were used to select eddy correlation measurements
   and parameters were identified with only the selected measurements. It
   is concluded that, for this forest and data set, PIMLI identifies a
   unique parameter set with high accuracy, whereas conventional
   calibrations on subdata sets give non-unique parameter estimates.

Abstract = {{An understanding of the symbiotic water and gas exchange processes at
   the ecosystem scale is essential to the development of appropriate
   restoration plans of extracted peatlands. This paper presents ecosystem
   scale measurements of the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon
   dioxide (CO2) from a restored vacuum extracted peatland in eastern
   Quebec, utilizing full-scale micrometeorological measurements of both
   evaporation and CO2. The results indicate that the adopted restoration
   practices reduce the loss of water from the peat, but CO2 emissions are
   similar to 25\% greater than an adjacent nonrestored comparison site.
   The blockage of drainage ditches and the existence of a mulch cover at
   the site keep the moisture conditions more or less constant.
   Consequently, the CO2 flux, which is predominantly soil respiration, is
   strongly controlled by peat temperature fluctuations. Copyright (C) 2001

Title = {{The dynamics of unattached benthic macroalgal accumulations in the
   Swan-Canning Estuary}},

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that macroalgal accumulations may impact on
   benthic nutrient cycling by promoting remineralization of sedimentary
   nutrients, otherwise inaccessible, and act as sinks/sources for
   dissolved nutrients in the water column. However, little consideration
   has been given to the time taken for these impacts to occur, and if
   accumulations persist long enough in a region for impacts to occur. In
   this study, accumulations were characterized seasonally, according to
   biomass, height relative to water depth, and organic content of the
   underlying sediment, from November 1996 to August 1997, in the
   Swan-Canning Estuary. Persistence of accumulations was measured from
   late summer to mid-winter in 1997, by tagging individual plants and
   recording the time tagged plants persisted at 10 sites. In summer 1998,
   physicochemical profiles of accumulations were measured over 24 h, at
   two locations: one with relatively low sediment organic content (SOCn)
   (1.5\% LOI) and one with relatively high SOC (6\% LOI).
   Accumulations rarely exceeded 25 cm in height, regardless of water
   column depth, and ranged between 100 and 500 g dwt m(-2). Macroalgae
   persisted between one week, in relatively well-flushed regions, to one
   month in areas with poor flushing. Over the entire diurnal period,
   almost 100\% of incident light was attenuated at the bottom of all
   accumulations. Dissolved oxygen levels at the bottom of accumulations
   were generally depressed, particularly at night, with hypoxia (1 mg
   1(-1)) recorded at the high SOC site at 03:00 h. No significant
   differences in FRP concentrations (approximately 30-60 mug 1-1) were
   recorded between sites, or within accumulation profiles. Ammonium levels
   were greatly raised inside accumulations at the high SOC site by 03:00 h
   (10 and 300 mug 1(-1), inside and outside, respectively). The results
   show that, where SOC is high, conditions within accumulations are
   affected. Impacts occurred within 24 h; well within the period for which
   accumulations persist. These results also indicate that regulation of
   hydrological regimes in estuarine systems may result in increased
   persistence of macroalgal accumulations, and associated water quality
   problems. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Halophila ovalis occupies about 20\% (461 ha) of the Swan-Canning
   Estuary. To assess the role of this plant in the biogeochemical cycling
   of the estuary, its biomass, nutrient dynamics and oxygen release from
   its roots to the sediment were investigated. This paper describes a
   conceptual model developed to extrapolate these findings to the whole
   estuary.
   The model follows changes in H. ovalis meadows in the Swan-Canning
   Estuary on a seasonal basis over an annual cycle. Total maximum seagrass
   biomass was estimated as 346 t dry weight (DW) in summer, declining in
   winter. In spring, although H. oxalis biomass did not increase, tissue
   nutrient concentrations were higher when external nutrient
   concentrations were high. From spring to summer, when external nutrient
   concentrations in the water column were severely depleted, shoot to
   root-rhizome biomass ratios changed from 1 : 1 in winter to 1 : 1.5 in
   summer. Plant tissue nutrients also decreased in root-rhizomes and
   increased in shoots, indicating an allocation of internal nutrient
   resources to the shoots for growth. Despite depletion of nitrogen in the
   water column, ammonium was still available in the sediment. Ammonium
   concentrations in the sediment porewater decreased in summer, suggesting
   H. ovalis meadows were a sink for ammonium. With an increase in biomass
   in summer, including the density of roots, oxygen release from H. ovalis
   roots subsequently increased. H. ovalis meadows act as a substantial
   sink for nutrients in the Swan-Canning Estuary in spring and summer. In
   winter, when there are large losses of plant biomass, H. ovalis meadows
   become a source of nutrients to the estuary. Copyright (C) 2001 John

Abstract = {{Temporal wet-season trends from 1987 to 1998 of total N and total P
   concentrations (TN and TP, respectively) in 14 tributaries to the
   Swan-Canning Estuary in Western Australia were evaluated using the
   Mann-Kendall or Seasonal kendall tests. Six of the catchments drained
   clay soils primarily on the Darling Plateau, which borders the sandy
   coastal plain on the east; two rural catchments drained the coastal
   plain; and six urban catchments drained the coastal plain. Generally, TN
   and TP were lower in tributaries draining clay soils than in tributaries
   draining siliceous sandy soils. Annual median TN and TP were relatively
   constant and no trends were detected in tributaries draining clay soils.
   TN and TP were higher (median TN = 1.6 and TP = 0.1 mg 1(-1)) and more
   variable temporally in tributaries draining the coastal plain.
   Statistically significant (alpha < 0.01) TN trends were detected in 50\%
   of the urban coastal plain tributaries and most were decreasing (-0.07
   to +0.53 mg 1(-1) year(-1)). Decreasing TP trends were detected at the
   two rural coastal plain tributaries and two of the urban drains (-0.01
   to 0.15 mg 1(-1) year(-1) over periods from 5 to 12 years). Flow
   adjustment of TN and TP was responsible for removing trends in the raw
   data at some sites. The inter-annual variability of TN and TP of coastal
   plain tributaries was also related to the proximity of the water table
   to the land surface, which in turn was related to the annual
   precipitation. Fixed-interval sampling may be able to detect TN and TP
   changes associated with the implementation of management strategies in
   sandy coastal plain catchments. Tributary sampling during rainstorms and
   continuous monitoring of discharge are needed to better define processes
   controlling nutrient flux and concentration variability, and to detect
   trends in the urban catchments and the clay soil catchments, primarily
   those draining the Darling Plateau. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Porewater fluxes into or out of the sediments in aquatic systems are
   frequently estimated using Fick's First Law. This assumes that diffusive
   processes control the transport of nutrients. As a corollary, advection,
   bioturbation and chemical processes are assumed not to be significant.
   Through a series of sediment core incubations, this paper seeks to
   quantify the uncertainties involved in such assumptions. Duplicate
   sediment cores were collected from 28 sites along the Swan-Canning
   Estuary, returned to the laboratory and incubated under oxic or anoxic
   conditions. Porewater nutrient concentrations, sediment porosity and
   initial nutrient concentrations in the overlying water were measured.
   These parameters were used to estimate the expected nutrient fluxes via
   Fick's First Law. The estimated fluxes were then compared with measured
   fluxes of nutrients out of the sediments over the incubation period.
   Severe bioturbation occurred in several of the anoxic treatments,
   resulting in large releases of nutrients into the overlying water. Aside
   from these bioturbated cores, phosphate and ammonium fluxes under anoxic
   conditions are well predicted by Fick's First Law. Nitrate fluxes are
   predicted well under oxic conditions. For coarse sediments (D-10
   averaging 0.3 mm) and under redox conditions favourable for nutrient
   release, Fick's First Law predicted close to 100\% of the observed
   fluxes. For finer grain sediments (D-10 < 0.01 mm), Fick's First Law
   overestimated the observed flux by up to 40\%. Under unfavourable oxygen
   conditions, chemical retardation processes are likely to dominate
   fluxes, and the error associated with using Fick's First Law is
   increased. These results confirm the usefulness of using Fick's First
   Law for a baseline estimate of nutrient fluxes under favourable redox
   conditions. Much greater care must be taken when using Fick's First Law
   to estimate nutrient fluxes under unfavourable redox conditions, or
   under conditions when bioturbation is likely to be severe. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Top-down control of algal blooms was investigated in the Swan-Canning
   Estuary, to determine whether the resident zooplankton community was
   able to substantially reduce phytoplankton biomass through grazing, or
   whether high phytoplankton biomass effectively inhibited grazing. In
   situ grazing by zooplankton at two depths in the water column was
   measured over a diel period on six occasions and examined in relation to
   the biotic and abiotic habitat conditions.
   Measured weight-specific ingestion rates varied with phytoplankton and
   zooplankton species composition, but were significantly greater at the
   surface than at 5 m, close to the bottom (ranges of 1.59 to 252.41 and
   0.51 to 2899 mug phytoplankton C mug zooplankton C-1 day(-1),
   respectively). There was no evidence of significant diel changes in
   ingestion rates of zooplankton. Phytoplankton biomass removed by in situ
   community grazing ranged between 0.9 and 45.0\% of standing stock per
   hour. The maximum loss occurred when phytoplankton biomass ranged from
   249.0 to 320.8 mug phytoplankton C 1(-1). Zooplankton grazing impact was
   negatively associated with high phytoplankton and low dissolved oxygen
   in bottom waters. The implications of, and mechanisms associated with,
   top-down control of algal biomass in this estuary are discussed in
   relation to plankton succession and the physical environment. Copyright

Abstract = {{A trial to artificially destratify part of the water column of the
   Swan-Canning Estuary took place over four weeks in 1997.
   Destratification was attempted with bubble plumes created by pumping
   compressed air through a porous pipe near the bed at a location in the
   upper estuary. The purpose of the trial was to determine whether the
   resultant bubble `curtain' could mix the water column, thereby altering
   the extent of upstream and downstream mixing and the vertical structures
   of salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. The
   destratification trial was monitored using three techniques: vertical
   profiles taken on several days at selected stations along the estuary,
   fine scale profiles in the vicinity of the bubble curtain on one day,
   and continuous water column profiles taken I km upstream of the curtain.
   The seasonal upstream propagation of brackish water underneath a
   residual freshwater discharge was affected by the magnitude of
   freshwater discharge and tidal elevations. Superimposed upon diurnal and
   semi-diurnal tides were non-tidal water level changes induced mostly by
   variations in barometric pressure. These caused large changes in the
   salt wedge position. Destratification by the bubble curtain was
   compromised by these large oscillations, which limited the exposure of
   the salt wedge region to the mixing action of the bubble curtain.
   Complete vertical mixing of the water column was observed up to 30 m
   either side of the curtain on 30 October. Disruptions to the density
   stratification were not evident beyond 350 m of the curtain. In the
   immediate vicinity (similar to 30 m) of the curtain, deficits of
   dissolved oxygen in bottom waters were generally reduced or obliterated
   and a naturally turbid plume of water near the bottom of the estuary was
   mixed through the water column. The effects of the bubble curtain on
   dissolved oxygen, turbidity and temperature were, however, similar to
   those for salinity, with mixing confined to around 30 m from the curtain
   and no effect observed further than 350 m away. The upper Swan River
   estuary, although relatively narrow and strongly vertically stratified,
   is unsuited to destratification using bubble plumes. Cycling of spring
   and neap tides and non-tidal water level changes, together with
   freshwater inflows to the estuary, strongly limit the longitudinal
   extent of mixing by bubble curtains. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected from the substrata of
   nearshore, shallow waters (depths < 1 m) and offshore, deeper waters
   (depths 2.5-5 m) of three regions in the saline lower reaches of the
   tributary rivers that comprise the upper Swan Estuary in each season
   between winter 1995 and autumn 1997. Freshwater discharge in the two
   tributary rivers varied markedly during both years and consequently
   salinities in the upper estuary ranged from < 1 parts per thousand in
   winter to > 30 parts per thousand in autumn. The most abundant species,
   the galeommatid bivalve Arthritica semen, contributed > 25\% to the
   total numbers of macroinvertebrates in both shallow and deeper waters.
   The continuous reproduction, rapid growth, short life cycle and
   tolerance to a wide range of salinities, that characterize this species,
   represent ideal adaptations for life in a seasonally very variable
   environment. The overall number of species and density of benthic
   macroinvertebrates were typically greater in shallow than deeper waters.
   Species composition also differed significantly between water depths.
   The nereidid polychaete Ceratonereis aequisetis and mytilid bivalve
   Xenostrobus securis, which feed on plant material, were relatively far
   more abundant in shallow than deeper waters, whereas the reverse was
   true for the spionid polychaete Prionospio cirrifera and sabellid
   polychaete Desdemona ornata, which feed on the detrital material that
   settles out in deep waters. Heavy freshwater discharge in winter 1996
   was accompanied by very marked changes in the richness, density and
   composition of species in shallow waters, but not in those of deeper
   waters where scouring would have been less pronounced. The species
   compositions in both the shallow and deeper waters of each region
   usually differed significantly among the seasons of each year and
   between the corresponding seasons in the different years. Region within
   the estuary had little or no influence on the species richness, density
   and faunal composition of benthic macroinvertebrates, even though the
   regions were located in two different tributary rivers. The above
   results demonstrate that, within each region, certain species were
   particularly successful in the first year, while others were more
   abundant in the second year, which in turn suggests that the benthic
   macroinvertebrate fauna of each region is responding to the same
   fine-scale differences between environmental conditions in the two
   years. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Fish were sampled in nearshore, shallow waters (<1.5 m deep) and
   offshore, deeper waters (2.5-5 m) of the saline lower reaches of the
   Swan and Canning Rivers, which collectively represent the upper
   Swan-Canning Estuary, by using seine and gill nets, respectively, in
   each season between winter 1995 and autumn 1997. Seventeen of the 34
   fish species caught during the study spawn in the upper estuaries. These
   species, which include the semi-anadromous Nematalosa vlaminghi,
   comprised 50.0\% of the number of species and 88.8\% of the number of
   fish in shallow waters and 43.8 and 89.9\%, respectively, of those in
   deeper waters. The two most abundant species in shallow waters,
   Engraulis australis and N. vlaminghi, contributed 36.0 and 19.6\%,
   respectively, to the total numbers of fish in those waters, and the
   latter species comprised nearly 50\% of the catch in deeper waters.
   During winter, when freshwater discharge increased sharply and
   salinities declined precipitously, the number of species and abundance
   of fish in shallow and deeper waters were generally at their lowest and
   the species composition was the most discrete. This reflected the
   downstream movement out of the upper estuary of substantial numbers of
   individuals of species such as N. vlaminghi, Acanthopagrus butcheri,
   Amniataba caudavittata, Atherinomorus ogilbyi, Atherinosoma elongata and
   Craterocephalus mugiloides and the upstream movement into the upper
   estuary of juvenile Mugil cephaltts. The overall fish fauna then changed
   quite abruptly in spring, when large N. vlatninghi, A. butcheri and A.
   caudavittata became abundant as they migrated into the upper estuary
   where they then spawned. During summer and autumn, the fauna in the
   shallows then changed more gradually through, inter alia, the
   recruitment of juvenile A. caudavittata and Sillago burrus and the
   influx of the small atherinids A. elongata and C. mugiloides. The abrupt
   change in the fish community in winter contrasts with the gradual,
   cyclical changes undergone during the year by the ichthyofaunas of
   holarctic, macrotidal estuaries, such as the Severn Estuary in the UK,
   in which the hydrology does not undergo such sudden, extreme seasonal
   changes and the ichthyofauna is dominated by marine and diadromous
   species that each enter the estuary at specific, but varying times of
   the year. Differences between the fish faunas of the shallow waters of
   the Swan and Canning Rivers are probably related to differences in the
   hydrological characteristics and locations of the mouths of these two
   tributaries. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Intact sediment cores containing microphytobenthos, dominated by
   episammic diatoms, were collected from shallow sand flats of the
   Swan-Canning Estuary, Perth, southwestern Australia, and their
   photosynthesis-light relations deduced from changes in oxygen (17 cores)
   or pH (13 cores). The theoretical saturating light intensity I-k
   determined from O-2 was 107 muE m(-2) s(-1), and the light intensity at
   which photosynthesis is saturated, I-sat, was about 1100 muE m(-2)
   s(-1). Mean gross production and respiration increased with temperature.
   Infaunal contributions to total respiration were measured for two cores
   at about 30\%.
   The sediment photic zone was estimated as 0.5 mm in fine sediments of
   the upper estuary and 3.5 mm in coarse sediments of the lower estuary.
   Microalgae from below the photic zone photosynthesized on exposure to
   light. Biomass (measured as chlorophyll a) decreased down the sediment
   profile and was linearly correlated with net and gross maximum
   photosynthesis. Relative photosynthetic efficiencies were high, and
   light compensation increased with increasing depth in the sediment.
   Q(10) values estimated from both net oxygen and carbon dioxide flux
   decreased with increasing temperature. Highest and lowest Q(10) values
   were for respiration and net production derived from pH measurements.

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effect of benthic macrofauna on nutrient
   fluxes. The influence of the macrofauna on nutrients released from the
   sediments was investigated experimentally in the laboratory using
   sediment cores from the Swan-Canning Estuary. Excretion rates of common
   benthic species were also measured to quantify the role of the
   macrofauna in estuarine nutrient cycling.
   The presence of macrofauna increased the release of phosphate and
   ammonium into the water column but decreased the release, or resulted in
   uptake, of nitrate by the sediments. There were no significant
   differences in porewater concentrations of ammonium, nitrate or
   phosphate between treatments with and without macrofauna. The macrofauna
   clearly had an important role in nutrient fluxes, as nutrient release
   differed between cores with and without fauna, and nutrient fluxes were
   significantly correlated with increased faunal biomass.
   Other factors, such as season and dissolved oxygen concentrations,
   influenced the concentration of nutrients released. Ammonium was
   released into the overlying water column at higher rates in winter than
   summer, while nitrate was released at higher rates in summer than
   winter. Aeration did not have a significant effect on nutrient fluxes,
   however there was a significant increase in filterable reactive
   phosphorus, and decrease in nitrate, in the porewater of cores which
   were not aerated.
   Benthic species excreted phosphate, nitrate and ammonium, with ammonium
   present in the largest amounts. Comparison of excretion rates to the
   amount of nutrients released into the water column in the core
   experiments revealed that excretion could account for 30\% of the
   phosphate and > 200\% of the ammonium measured in the water column.
   Clearly the benthic macrofauna have a significant role with respect to
   benthic nutrient fluxes within the Swan-Canning Estuary, with benthic
   regeneration of nutrients estimated to equal external loading of
   nutrients. However, further work is required to more precisely define
   the influence of seasonality, dissolved oxygen, microbial activity and
   sediment characteristics on nutrient fluxes. Copyright (C) 2001 John

Abstract = {{Catchment nutrient availability in Western Australia is primarily
   controlled by the disposal of animal waste and the type and rate of
   fertilizer application, particularly on the relatively narrow (similar
   to 25 km wide), sandy coastal plain. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)
   concentrations and fluxes during the wet season of 15 tributaries,
   including four urban drains to the Swan-Canning Estuary, were evaluated
   from 1986 to 1992 and additionally concentrations only were evaluated
   throughout the year from 1993 to 1996. Concentrations of filtered
   reactive P (FRP) and total P (TP) were generally low, with the
   volume-weighted means for all sites being 0.06 mg 1(-1) and 0.12 mg
   1(-1) respectively. The urban drains had higher TP concentrations
   (volume-weighted mean of 0.21 mg 1(-1)) than the streams (0.12 mg
   1(-1)), with the high concentrations associated with particulate matter.
   Total inorganic N (TIN, NH4N plus NO3N) and total N (TN), which is of
   interest to eutrophic status of the N-limited estuary, were likewise
   low, compared with other developed areas having a similar climate. Both
   TIN and TN were higher in the urban drains (0.76 mg 1(-1) and 1.5 mg
   1(-1) respectively) than the streams (0.31 mg 1(-1) and 1.2 mg 1(-1)
   respectively). The Avon River, which drains 98.5\% of the 121000 km(2)
   catchment area, contributes most of the N (0.03 kg ha(-1) year(-1) or
   65\%) and a high percentage of the P (<0.01 kg ha(-1) year(-1) or 32\%)
   to the estuaries. The Avon River nutrient fluxes are much less than
   other tributaries closer to the estuary. The coastal plain receives
   significantly higher rainfall (1,200 mm year(-1)) and has more intense
   horticulture and animal production than inland areas (< 300 mm
   year(-1)). Annual rainfall is seasonal, occurring primarily from May
   through December. The surficial aquifers on the coastal plain generally
   are sandy with a low nutrient retention capacity, and rapidly transmit
   soluble and colloidal material in subsurface flow. Ellen Brook, on the
   coastal plain, drains pastures treated with superphosphate and has the
   highest FRP (0.51 mg 1(-1)), TP (0.7 mg 1(-1)) and TN (2.1 mg 1(-1)) of
   any tributary to the estuary. The coastal plain is also undergoing
   urbanization, particularly in areas adjacent to the estuary. Nutrients
   are subsequently available for transport during the onset of seasonal
   wet weather. Perennial baseflow from urban areas is an important source
   of nutrients. Water yield from the urban areas was high, being as much
   as 50\% of annual rainfall. The timing of the nutrients delivered by the
   tributaries may be an important control on estuarine ecology. Copyright

Abstract = {{Spring chlorophyte-, summer dinophyte- and autumn cryptophyte-dominated
   phytoplankton blooms occurring in the upper reaches of the Swan-Canning
   Estuary have been studied to compare species composition and diurnal
   distribution and to determine preferential uptake rates for different
   nitrogen sources. Species distribution patterns over diurnal cycles
   showed dinophyte and cryptophyte species exhibiting diurnal vertical
   migrations patterns which changed over a three-week bloom period. The
   dinophyte and cryptophyte behaviour appeared to be related to measured
   changes in ambient nitrogen profiles over the course of the bloom.
   Chlorophyte species were not shown to be strongly migratory over diurnal
   periods. Absolute uptake rates (rho, approximating P-max) for nitrogen,
   in the form of (NO3-)-N-15, (NH4+)-N-15 or N-15-urea, were compared
   between seasonal bloom assemblages and ranged between 0.02 and 12 mug N
   1(-1) h(-1) (NO3 0.02-7; NH4 0.4-9; urea 0.1-12 mug N 1(-1) h(-1)).
   Specific uptake rates (upsilon) ranged between 2 and 1770 ng N ng
   Chla(-1) h(-1) (NO3 2-290; NH4 19-1770; urea 6-1730 ng N mug Chla(-1)
   h(-1)). Relative preference indices (RPI) for NO3 (new N) vs. NH4
   (recycled N) were calculated to determine whether allochthonous or
   autochthonous nitrogen sources were implicated in supporting these
   blooms. Results indicated no physiological preference at any depth for
   NO3 or NH; during spring and autumn, and for summer surface assemblages.
   There was a strong preference for NH4 (RPI similar to 0.95) at mid and
   bottom depths during summer. Ambient NH4 uptake rates were compared with
   changes in ambient NH, profiles to determine the importance of measuring
   fluxes against absolute parameter measurements in understanding the
   nitrogen dynamics supporting phytoplankton growth.
   From flux measurements it was found that apparent reappearance rates for
   NH4 ranging between 1\% and 1030\% of absolute uptake rates occurred
   during summer, with decreases equivalent to 100\% of ambient uptake rate
   occurring at depth at night. Nutrient profiling alone, in the absence of
   knowledge of nutrient fluxes, was insufficient in assessing possible
   nutrient control over phytoplankton growth and biomass maintenance.
   Within this system there is the potential for phytoplankton growth and
   bloom maintenance to occur supported solely by recycling of NH4.

Abstract = {{Salinity in the Swan-Canning Estuary, Western Australia, varies
   seasonally from freshwater conditions in winter up to the salinity of
   seawater in summer. Field observations show that the resulting seasonal
   density contrasts between the estuary and the adjacent fresh groundwater
   system are sufficient to drive mixed-convection cells that give rise to
   circulation of river water in the aquifer. In this study, we examine the
   role of steady density-driven convection as a mechanism that contributes
   to the exchange of dissolved nutrients, particularly ammonium, between
   the Swan-Canning Estuary and the local groundwater system. We present
   results from two-dimensional (section) and three-dimensional
   density-coupled flow and mass transport modelling, in comparison with
   Glover's abrupt-interface solution for saltwater intrusion. The
   modelling is focused on developing an understanding of the physical
   processes that influence the longterm or mean convective behaviour of
   groundwater beneath the estuary. It :is shown that the convective
   stability depends fundamentally on the interplay between two factors:
   (1) the downward destabilizing buoyancy effect of density contrasts
   between the estuary and aquifer; and (2) the upward stabilizing
   influence of regional groundwater discharge. The structure of convection
   cells beneath the estuary and recirculation rates of estuary water
   within the groundwater system are shown to be related to a flow-modified
   Rayleigh number that depends critically on the aquifer anisotropy and
   estuary meander pattern. The recirculation of estuary water by these
   mechanisms is responsible for transport of high concentrations of
   ammonium, observed in pore fluids in the estuary bed sediments, into
   groundwater and its eventual return to the estuary. Copyright (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The temporal cycles of variation in salinity, temperature and river flow
   in the Swan-Canning Estuary plus rainfall in the vicinity are examined.
   A `normal' pattern is defined for rainfall and river flow based on
   long-term median monthly values from available historical data.
   Long-term monthly median rainfall and median monthly river flow were
   highly correlated. Deviations from the `normal' patterns of rainfall and
   river flow are documented. Three years of detailed data on the temporal
   distribution of the algal biomass and phytoplankton community
   composition from the Swan-Canning Estuary are presented and discussed.
   Significant interannual variability in the phytoplankton biomass was
   observed with 1996 having a significantly lower median chlorophyll a
   concentration than 1995 or 1997. Different years also had pronounced
   differences in the timing; persistence and occurrence of algal blooms.
   Links with, and between, rainfall, river flow, nutrient concentrations
   and phytoplankton biomass are made by careful examination of the
   temporal patterns. Deviations from the proposed `normal' temporal
   pattern of physical and chemical environmental factors relevant to the
   growth of phytoplankton biomass are assessed. Deviations from `normal'
   rainfall and river flow, depending upon their timing and intensity,
   appear to be associated with occurrence of algal blooms. For example,
   the lack of a dinoflagellate bloom in December 1996 or January 1997
   appears to be associated with a wetter than normal spring. Based upon
   the observed data, published reports and basic principles of algal
   ecology a set of predicted responses to variation in the major
   environmental variables (rainfall and river flow) are tabulated. The
   tabulated predictions are proposed as a useful tool for resource
   managers. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The Swan and Canning Rivers converge to form an estuary that is
   seasonally, forced by wet winter and dry summer conditions. The estuary
   is also tidally forced due to its contact with the Indian Ocean. The
   perception that the occurrence of nuisance algal blooms has increased in
   frequency and severity in recent years has prompted the present
   investigation into the interaction of the shallow groundwater system
   with the Swan-Canning Estuary. The extent to which this interaction
   contributes to nutrient delivery to the river is a focus of the work.
   Groundwater interaction with the upper reaches of the Swan River is
   shown to occur at three length scales: (i) the scale of the river-bed
   sediments (i.e. < 10 m); (ii) the scale over which tidal forcing of the
   river is transmitted into the adjacent aquifer (10 to 100 m); and (iii)
   the scale of the regional groundwater field (> 1000 m). Two-dimensional
   groundwater flow modelling in plan covering the regionally advected
   groundwater flow domain of the upper Swan River Estuary from the
   Causeway to Guildford shows that there is a net groundwater discharge to
   the Swan River of groundwater discharge of about 80000 m(3)/day, or
   about 29 million m(3)/year. Between 1987 and 1996, the average surface
   tributary inflow to the Swan River was about 460 million m(3)/year. Thus
   groundwater discharge contributed approximately 6\% of the total annual
   river flow. This percentage is clearly small in comparison to the total
   river flow. However, in the six months from November to April in summer,
   tributary flow into the Swan River declines sharply to an average total
   of approximately 12 million m(3). Groundwater discharge during this
   six-month period is approximately 14 million m(3) or about 55\% of the
   surface tributary flow, and thus groundwater is a significant component
   of the total inflow to the Swan-Canning Estuary during this period.
   Nutrient concentrations, particularly ammonium, within the sediment pore
   fluids underlying the river are very high relative to concentrations in
   the river, such that groundwater discharge rates of this magnitude are
   capable of introducing significant nutrient loadings to the river. The
   nitrogen load to the Swan River derived from regionally advected
   groundwater discharge is conservatively estimated at between 30 and 60
   t/year. This ranks groundwater as one of the highest single inputs of
   nitrogen to the Swan-Canning Estuary when compared to surface water
   flows. It contributes about 10\% of the total nitrogen load entering
   this reach of the river. Seasonal and tidal variations increase the
   complexity of the system and may act to increase the presence and
   availability of groundwater-derived nutrients in the river and estuary
   system.
   Field observations and results from numerical groundwater flow
   modelling; show that groundwater preferentially discharges into the Swan
   River along the outside of river meanders. Along the inside of meanders,
   groundwater discharge is either very low or at times the flow direction
   reverses such that saline river water recharges the aquifer during the
   late spring, summer and early autumn months. Short-term, high-frequency
   fluctuations such as wave-induced displacement, seawater intrusion,
   hyporheic flux and tidal fluctuations may cause small spatial scale
   mixing and perturbation of the nutrient-rich groundwater and sediment
   porewater with either the river water directly or with fresher
   groundwater as it discharges to the river. These short-term fluctuations
   appear to cause nutrient release from the sediment pore fluids,
   particularly in summer low flow periods such that they are a significant
   contributing factor in triggering algal blooms. Copyright (C) 2001 John

Abstract = {{Annual data sets, from 1980-81 and 1994-95, provide evidence that
   inter-annual differences in the seasonal succession of phytoplankton in
   the Swan River Estuary can be attributed to rainfall and salt-wedge
   movement. The distribution and succession of phytoplankton are
   influenced by seasonal variation of rainfall and its subsequent effect
   on the spatial distribution of salinity. The longer duration of rainfall
   in 1980-81 compared with 1994-95 effectively restricted the movement of
   the salt-water wedge, thereby delaying the progression of marine
   phytoplankton into the estuary. There was little difference in the
   phytoplankton composition and biomass in the lower estuary, while the
   upper estuary appeared to have more blooms of dinoflagellates in the
   summer and autumn of 1994-95 compared with 1980-81.
   The intensity and duration of rainfall appeared to affect the
   availability of soluble nutrients. Although there was no significant
   difference in phytoplankton biomass between the two periods, it was
   likely that the high phytoplankton biomass in the upper estuary in
   1994-95 was due to availability of more soluble nutrients from internal
   recycling processes at the sediment/water interface. Copyright (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Analysis of groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer has received
   increasing attention by hydrogeologists for the design of drainage
   systems or the prediction of drawdown patterns of the water table in an
   aquifer neighbouring a pumping well. In this study, we attempt to
   analyse mathematically the variation of the water table in a horizontal
   unconfined aquifer receiving uniform recharge and bounded by parallel
   streams during a continuous cycle of rising and falling head conditions.
   The Boussinesq equation was taken to be the governing equation
   describing the transient changes in the water table. This problem was
   simplified to a one-dimensional heat equation based on the assumption
   that the aquifer thickness is large enough compared to the water table
   changes and that the Dupuit-Forchheimer approximations are valid. We
   solved the heat equation using a method of variable separation in which
   the solution consists of both the steady-state and nonsteady-state
   solutions. With this method, the solutions could be obtained for various
   initial conditions such as different heads at the left and right
   boundaries and variable head distribution. In addition, simultaneous
   analysis of water table changes for both rising and falling head cases
   could be obtained. Comparison with other analytical solutions obtained
   for the linearized Boussinesq equation with Laplace transformation gives
   a nearly identical result, supporting the validity of the assumption and
   mathematical method used in this study. Advantages of the method over
   Laplace transformation can be found from the fact that our method
   renders the initial condition more flexible and simultaneous analysis of
   water table changes during rising and falling head cases can be done.

Abstract = {{Vertical inaccuracies in terrain data propagate through dispersal area
   subroutines to create uncertainties in runoff flowpath predictions. This
   study documented how terrain error sensitivities in the D8, Multiple
   Flow (MF), DEMON, D-Infinity and two hybrid dispersal area algorithms,
   responded to changes in terrain slope and error magnitude. Runoff
   dispersal areas were generated from convergent and divergent sections of
   low, medium, and high gradient 64-ha parcels using a 30 m pixel scale
   control digital elevation model (DEM) and an ensemble of alternative
   realizations of the control DEM. The ensemble of alternative DEM
   realizations was generated randomly to represent root mean square error
   (RMSE) values ranging from 0.5 to 6 m and spatial correlations of 0 to
   0.999 across 180 m lag distances. Dispersal area residuals, derived by
   differencing output from control and ensemble simulations, were used to
   quantify the spatial consistency of algorithm dispersal area
   predictions. A maximum average algorithm consistency of 85\% was
   obtained in steep sloping convergent terrain, and two map analysis
   techniques are recommended in maintaining high spatial consistencies
   under less optimum terrain conditions. A stochastic procedure was
   developed to translate DEM error into dispersal area probability maps,
   and thereby better represent uncertainties in runoff modelling and
   management. Two uses for these runoff probability maps include watershed
   management indices that identify the optimal areas for intercepting
   polluted runoff as well as Monte-Carlo-ready probability distributions
   that report the cumulative pollution impact of each pixel's downslope
   dispersal area. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Humid tropical regions are often characterized by extreme variability of
   fluvial processes. The Rio Terraba drains the largest river basin,
   covering 4767 km(2), in Costa Rica. Mean annual rainfall is 3139 +/-
   419(sd) mm and mean annual discharge is 2168 +/- 492(sd) mm (1971-88).
   Loss of forest cover, high rainfall erosivity and geomorphologic
   instability all have led to considerable degradation of soil and water
   resources at local to basin scales. Parametric and nonparametric
   statistical methods were used to estimate sediment yields.
   In the Terraba basin, sediment yields per unit area increase from the
   headwaters to the basin mouth, and the trend is generally robust towards
   choice of methods (parametric and LOESS) used. This is in contrast to a
   general view that deposition typically exceeds sediment delivery with
   increase in basin size. The specific sediment yield increases from 112
   +/- 11.4(sd) t km(-2) year(-1) (at 317.9 km(2) on a major headwater
   tributary) to 404 +/- 141.7(sd) t km(-2) year(-1) (at 4766.7 km(2)) at
   the basin mouth (1971-92). The analyses of relationships between
   sediment yields and basin parameters for the Terraba sub-basins and for
   a total of 29 basins all over Costa Rica indicate a strong land use
   effect related to intensive agriculture besides hydro-climatology. The
   best explanation for the observed pattern in the Terraba basin is a
   combined spatial pattern of land use and rainfall erosivity. These were
   integrated in a soil erosion index that is related to the observed
   patterns of sediment yield. Estimated sediment delivery ratios increase
   with basin area. Intensive agriculture in lower-lying alluvial fans
   exposed to highly erosive rainfall contributes a large part of the
   sediment load. The higher elevation regions, although steep in slope,
   largely remain under forest, pasture, or tree-crops. High rainfall
   erosivity (> 7400 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1) year (-1)) is associated with land
   uses that provide inadequate soil protection. It is also associated with
   steep, unstable slopes near the basin mouth.
   Improvements in land use and soil management in the lower-lying regions
   exposed to highly erosive rainfall are recommended, and are especially
   important to basins in which sediment delivery ratio increases
   downstream with increasing basin area. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Bulk runoff and meteorological data suggest the occurrence of two
   meltwater outburst events at Finsterwalderbreen, Svalbard, during the
   1995 and 1999 melt seasons. Increased bulk meltwater concentrations of
   Cl- during the outbursts indicate the release of snowmelt from storage.
   Bulk meltwater hydrochernical data and suspended sediment concentrations
   suggest that this snowmelt accessed a chemical weathering environment
   characterized by high rock:water ratios and long rock-water contact
   times. This is consistent with a subglacial origin. The trigger for both
   the 1995 and 1999 outbursts is believed to be high rates of surface
   meltwater production and the oversupply of meltwater to areas of the
   glacier bed that were at the pressure melting point, but which were
   unconnected to the main subglacial drainage network. An increase in
   subglacial water pressure to above the overburden pressure lead to the
   forcing of a hydrological connection between the expanding subglacial
   reservoir and the ice-marginal channelized system. The purging of ice
   blocks from the glacier during the outbursts may indicate the breach of
   an ice dam during connection. Although subglacial meltwater issued
   continually from the glacier terminus via a subglacial upwelling during
   both melt seasons, field observations showed outburst meltwaters were
   released solely via an ice-marginal channel. It is possible that
   outburst events are a seasonal phenomenon at this glacier and reflect
   the periodic drainage of meltwaters from the same subglacial reservoir
   from year to year. However, the location of this reservoir is uncertain.
   A 100 m high bedrock ridge traverses the glacier 6.5 km from its
   terminus. The overdeepened area up-glacier from this is the most
   probable site for subglacial meltwater accumulation. Copyright (C) 2001

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the application of a data-based mechanistic (DBM)
   modelling approach using transfer function models (TFMs) with non-linear
   rainfall filtering to predict runoff generation from a semi-arid
   catchment (795 km(2)) in Tanzania. With DBM modelling, time series of
   rainfall and streamflow were allowed to suggest an appropriate model
   structure compatible with the data available. The model structures were
   evaluated by looking at how well the model fitted the data, and how well
   the parameters of the model were estimated. The results indicated that a
   parallel model structure is appropriate with a proportion of the runoff
   being routed through a fast flow pathway and the remainder through a
   slow flow pathway. Finally, the study employed a Generalized Likelihood
   Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology to evaluate the parameter
   sensitivity and predictive uncertainty based on the feasible parameter
   ranges chosen from the initial analysis of recession curves and
   calibration of the TFM. Results showed that parameters that control the
   slow flow pathway are relatively more sensitive than those that control
   the fast flow pathway of the hydrograph. Within the GLUE framework, it
   was found that multiple acceptable parameter sets give a range of
   predictions. This was found to be an advantage, since it allows the
   possibility of assessing the uncertainty in predictions as conditioned
   on the calibration data and then using that uncertainty as part of the
   decision-making process arising from any rainfall-runoff modelling
   project. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The mid- to high-boreal forest in Canada occupies the discontinuous
   permafrost zone, and is often underlain by glaciolacustrine sediments
   mantled by a highly porous organic mat. The result is a poorly drained
   landscape dominated by wetlands. Frost-table dynamics and surface
   storage conditions help to control runoff contributions from various
   landscape elements, hydrological linkages between these elements, and
   basin streamflow during spring snowmelt. Runoff components and pathways
   in a forested peatland basin were assessed during two spring snowmelts
   with contrasting input and basin conditions. Runoff from relatively
   intense melt (up to 16 mm day(-1)) on slopes with limited soil thawing
   combined with large pre-melt storage in surface depressions to produce
   high flows composed primarily of meltwater (78\% of the 0.29 m(3) s(-1)
   peak discharge) routed over wetland surfaces and through permeable upper
   peat layers. Melt intensity was less in the subsequent year (maximum of
   10 mm day(-1)) and active layer development was relatively greater (0.2
   m deeper at the end of spring melt), resulting in less slope runoff.
   Coupling of reduced slope contributions with lower storage levels in
   basin wetlands led to relatively subdued streamflows dominated by older
   water (73\% of the 0.09 m(3) s(-1) peak discharge) routed through
   less-permeable deeper peat layers and mineral soil. Interannual
   differences in runoff conditions provide important insight for the
   development of distributed hydrological models for boreal forest basins
   and into potential influences on biogeochemical cycling in this
   landscape under a warming climate. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Many investigations show relationships between topographical factors and
   the spatial distribution of soil moisture in catchments. However, few
   quantitative analyses have been carried out to elucidate the role of
   different hydrological processes in the spatial distribution of topsoil
   moisture in catchments. A spatially distributed rainfall-runoff model
   was used to investigate contributions of subsurface matric flow,
   macropore flow and surface runoff to the spatial distribution of soil
   moisture in a cultivated catchment. The model results show that lateral
   subsurface flow in the soil matrix or in macropores has a minor effect
   on the spatial distribution of soil moisture. Only when a perched
   groundwater table is maintained long enough, which is only possible if
   the subsurface is completely impermeable, may a spatial distribution in
   moisture content occur along the slope. Surface runoff, producing
   accumulations of soil moisture in flat flow paths of agricultural origin
   (field boundaries), was demonstrated to cause significant spatial
   variations in soil moisture within a short period after rainfall (<2
   days). When significant amounts of surface runoff are produced, wetter
   moisture conditions will be generated at locations with larger upstream
   contributing areas. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Simple but effective models are needed for the prediction of rainfall
   interception under a full range of environmental and management
   conditions. The Liu model was validated using data published in the
   literature and was compared with two leading models in the literature:
   the Rutter and the Gash models. The Liu model was tested against the
   Rutter model on a single-storm basis with interception measurements
   observed from an old-growth Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest
   in Oregon, USA. Simulated results by the Liu model were close to the
   measurements and comparable to those predicted by the Rutter model. The
   Liu model was further tested against the Gash model on a multistorm
   basis. The Gash and Liu models successfully predicted long-term
   interception losses from a broad range of 20 forests around the world.
   Results also indicated that both the Gash and the Liu models could be
   used to predict rainfall interception using daily rainfall data,
   although it was assumed in both models that there is only one storm per
   rain day. The sensitivity of the Liu model to stand storage capacity,
   canopy gap fraction and evaporation rate from wet canopy surface during
   rainfall was investigated. Results indicate that the Liu model has the
   simplest form, least data requirements and comparable accuracy for
   predicting rainfall interception as compared with the Rutter and the
   Gash models. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Water vapour in the atmosphere and various meteorological phenomena are
   essential to the understanding of the mechanism of the water cycle.
   However, it is very difficult to observe water vapour in the atmosphere
   because the quantities are usually observed at a single point not over
   long intervals or in a specific plane or volume. Accordingly, the use of
   radio waves is considered to be necessary to observe water vapour. Radio
   waves can be transmitted over long intervals and across large areas, and
   generally speaking, the characteristics of radio waves change due to
   material in the atmosphere, especially water vapour. Usually absorption
   is used to observe the quantity of water vapour. But the relationship
   between absorption and the quantity of water vapour is not linear, so we
   try to utilize the phase difference between two radio waves as an
   alternative method. First, the relationship between the phase delay and
   the water vapour was induced by a physical equation and the resulting
   phase delay was found to be proportional to the quantity of water
   vapour. Furthermore, the phase difference between two separate points
   was observed by use of two radio waves in the field, specifically 84 GHz
   and 245 GHz. For reference and comparison, water vapour density in the
   atmosphere was simultaneously observed by meteorological observation. As
   a result, the density of the water vapour was found to be proportional
   to the phase difference between the two radio waves. The result also
   shows that this method is able to measure the diurnal changes in water
   vapour density in each season. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The geomorphologic area function and width function that characterize
   the forms of hillslope and river networks are two key parameters
   employed in the GBHM (geomorphology-based hydrological model) for
   representing the hydrological processes together with other spatial
   information. One fundamental issue on the use of the geomorphologic
   properties is the spatial resolution sensitivity in both the threshold
   area for river network generation and digital elevation model (DEM)
   resolution. The threshold area is the minimum drainage area required to
   initiate the river; the DEM resolution depends on the available
   elevation data. In the present study, multifractal analysis was used to
   investigate the sensitivity of width functions extracted by different
   threshold areas and the sensitivity of area functions extracted from
   various resolutions of DEMs. Fifteen Japanese catchments were selected
   for the sensitivity analysis based on 250 rn mesh DEM data. It was found
   that the river networks generated with larger threshold areas tend to
   lose the detailed scaling information. When the DEM mesh size increases,
   the river networks extracted with the same threshold area become sparser
   and the topography tends to be flat and scaling structures of the area
   functions become simpler. The runoff generations of the GBMA were
   influenced by the DEM resolution. The effect of the DEM resolution on
   the hydrological response is related to the temporal resolution with
   more influence on the hourly response compared with the daily response.
   From the relation between the scaling structure expressed by the
   multifractal spectrum and the hydrological response of a catchment, it
   was found that the detailed scaling information had more effect on the
   hydrological response of higher temporal resolution. Copyright (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The main aim of this study is to discuss the temporal and spatial
   distributions of the snow water equivalent, snowmelt and discharge in a
   multibasin scale (Tohoku Region, Japan; covering about 77 000 km(2)),
   using the heat budget model with the help of remote sensing (satellite
   images and meteorological radar). The calculated distributions of snow
   water equivalent were similar to that of the snow map obtained from the
   satellite images. At the same time, the seasonal variation of discharge
   in the three basins investigated (Yuda, covering 583 km(2),
   Shichikasyuku, 237 km(2) and Okutadami, 426 km(2)) was in good agreement
   with the observed one at the dam. Moreover, we conducted sensitivity
   tests for increasing solar radiation and air temperature by adding 10
   W/m(2) to the solar radiation and I degree to air temperature,
   respectively. The peaks of the snow cover area did not change so much,
   although the area in the snowmelt season decreased in these cases. The
   snow water equivalent in both cases became smaller than the control,
   particularly in the case of a 1 degree increase in air temperature. The
   snowmelt and discharge increased in the first half of the snowmelt
   period but were less than the control in the latter half. The model
   suggested in this study will be able to estimate changes in the
   hydrological elements related to snow, if a scenario of the climate
   change is provided. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Subsurface flow within forest hillslopes is not well understood. A soil
   pit containing macropores was prepared and instrumented for subsurface
   flow measurements at the Hitachi Ohta Experimental Watershed. The
   subsurface flow from the soil profile was divided into five groups: the
   porous (including macropores) organic-rich soil layer; three macropore
   groups in the mineral soil layer; and the mineral soil matrix excluding
   visible macropores. The outflow from the organic-rich soil layer
   coincided with rainfall and depended strongly on rainfall intensity.
   Such a response is related to the location of the organic-rich layer in
   the uppermost portion of the soil profile. One macropore in the mineral
   soil was connected directly to a hydraulically active fracture in the
   bedrock. Therefore, the flow from this macropore group was high and
   delayed relative to rainfall even though the group is located in the
   upper left portion of the mineral soil layer. Most of the hillslope
   discharge occurred from the soil matrix excluding visible macropores.
   Preferential flow pathways in the mineral soil, as evidenced by staining
   tests, contributed to stormflow. The flow from two macropores just above
   bedrock was generally very low and responded gradually to rainfall
   inputs. This minor outflow was influenced by preferential flow above
   bedrock. Four macropores in the upper right portion of the mineral soil
   layer did not connect to preferential flow pathways. Therefore, outflow
   from this group was measured only when large rain events occurred. Soil
   moisture, amounts and intensities of rainfall, and bedrock topography
   affected heterogeneous outflow from the soil profile. The expansion and
   extension of macropore networks might contribute to stormflow. Results
   indicate that hydrometric measurements are needed to support inferences
   derived from end member mixing analysis and topographic-based hydrologic
   models related to complex preferential flow pathways in forest
   catchments. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Since the 1980s, several field studies of pipeflow hydrology have been
   conducted in forested, steep headwater catchments. However, adequate
   information is lacking with regard to questions as to how representative
   these previous studies are and how widespread the phenomena might be.
   Thus, the aim of this study is to review some studies of pipeflow
   hydrology on forested steep hillslopes. Several points were clarified.
   (1) The maximum discharge of pipeflow was mainly determined by the soil
   pipe diameter. When the condition of both the soil pipe diameter and the
   slope gradient in forest soil were similar to those in peaty podzol, the
   maximum discharge of pipeflow on forest slopes was slighter than that in
   peaty podzol. (2) Pipeflow was delivered from a variety of sources, and
   the contributing area of pipeflow extended as the soil layer became
   wetter. Therefore, the dominant contributor (new water and old water)
   was varied and the contribution of pipeflow to streamflow increased with
   the increase of rainfall magnitude. (3) The roles of pipeflow in the
   storm runoff generation processes demonstrated two roles: the
   concentration of water and the rapid drainage to downslopes. Thus, soil
   pipes can increase the peak discharge from the hillslope and decrease
   the peak lag time of the storm hydrograph, when compared to the unpiped
   hillslope. (4) The roles of pipeflow on hydrological process suggested
   that the soil pipes contribute to the slope stability by increasing the
   rate of soil drainage and limiting the development of perched
   groundwater conditions. However, if the rate of water concentration to
   the soil pipe network is in excess of the pipeflow transmission
   capacity, the cavity of the soil pipe could readily be filled with water
   during a rain event, increasing pore water pressure in the surrounding
   matrix. In this case, the soil pipe induced slope instability. (5)
   Moreover, pipe erosion has significant impact on the runoff
   characteristics of pipeflow, since pipe erosion contributed to a change
   in the limited drainage capacity of soil pipe. Thus, pipe erosion plays
   an important role in shallow landslide initiation. Copyright (C) 2001

Abstract = {{A distributed hydrological model, water and energy transfer processes
   (WEP) model, is developed to simulate spatially variable water and
   energy processes in watersheds with complex land covers. In the model,
   state variables include depression storage on land surfaces and
   canopies, soil moisture content, land surface temperature, groundwater
   tables and water stages in rivers, etc. The subgrid heterogeneity of
   land use is also taken into consideration by using the mosaic method.
   For hydrological processes, evapotranspiration is computed by the
   Pemnan-Monteith equation, infiltration excess during heavy rains is
   simulated by a generalized Green-Ampt model, whereas saturation excess
   during the remaining periods is obtained by doing balance analysis in
   unsaturated soil layers. A two-dimensional simulation of multilayered
   aquifers is performed for groundwater flow. Flow routing is conducted by
   using the kinematic wave method in a one-dimensional scheme. For energy
   processes, short-wave radiation is based on observation or deduced from
   sunshine duration, long-wave radiation is calculated according to
   temperatures, latent and sensible fluxes are computed by the aerodynamic
   method and surface temperature is solved by the force-restore method. In
   addition, anthropogenic components, e.g. water supply, groundwater lift,
   sewerage drainage and energy consumption, etc. are also taken into
   account. The model is applied to the Ebi River watershed (27 km(2)) with
   a grid size of 50 m and a time step of 1 h. The model is verified
   through comparisons of simulated river discharges, groundwater levels
   and land surface temperatures with the observed values. A comparison
   between water balance at present (1993) and that in the future (2035) is
   also conducted. It is found that the hydrological cycle in the future
   can be improved through the implementation of infiltration trenches for
   the storm water from urban canopies. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{In and environments groundwater may represent the most important source
   of water for sustaining life. The timing and nature of precipitation may
   induce infiltration and recharge on a small scale. The Al Ain region,
   UAE was chosen and from 1996 to 1997 studies were conducted to
   illustrate spatial distribution of recharge for groundwater by using
   chemical and isotopic methods. According to the field survey, UAE can be
   hydrogeologically classified into five parts: mountain area, wadis, sand
   dunes, inland sabkhas and coastal sabkhas, respectively. In this report,
   we studied a typical wadi, Wadi Mieshiq area. Upstream of the wadi, it
   was found that the groundwaters were characterized by low salinity.
   Stable isotopes of groundwaters in the wadi were lighter than those of
   the stream waters in the mountain area, since stream water was affected
   by evaporation before it infiltrated into the ground. The isotopes of
   recharged water into the wadi must have isotopically light values. From
   the results above, groundwater along the wadi was mainly derived from
   not only water from the mountain area but also infiltrated water during
   the flood period. Wadis are an important recharge region for
   groundwater. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Preferential flow paths are known to be important conduits of subsurface
   stormflow in forest hillslopes. Earlier research on preferential flow
   paths focused on vertical transport; however, lateral transport is also
   evident in steep forested slopes underlain by bedrock or till.
   Macropores consisting of decayed and live roots, subsurface erosion,
   surface bedrock fractures, and animal burrows form the basis of a
   `backbone' for lateral preferential flow in such sites. Evidence from
   field studies in Japan indicates that although individual macropore
   segments are generally <0(.)5 m in length, they have a tendency to
   self-organize into larger preferential How systems as sites become
   wetter. Staining tests show clear evidence of interconnected macropore
   flow segments, including: How within decayed root channels and
   subsurface erosion cavities; flow in small depressions of the bedrock
   substrate; fracture How in weathered bedrock; exchange between
   macropores and mesopores; and flow at the organic horizon-mineral soil
   interface and in buried pockets of organic material and loose soil. Here
   we develop a three-dimensional model fur preferential flow systems based
   on distributed attributes of macropores and potential connecting nodes
   (e.g. zones of loose soil and buried organic matter). We postulate that
   the spatially variable and non-linear preferential How response observed
   at our Japan field site, as well as at other sites, is attributed to
   discrete segments of macropores connecting at various nodes within the
   regolith. Each node is activated by local soil water conditions and is
   influenced strongly by soil depth, permeability, pore size, organic
   matter distribution, surface and substrate topography, and possibly
   momentum dissipation. This study represents the first attempt to
   characterize the spatially distributed nature of preferential flow paths
   at the hillslope scale and presents strong evidence that these networks
   exhibit complex system behaviour. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The influence of bedrock subsurface flow on storm runoff generation was
   investigated in Japan in two regions in Japan underlain by three bedrock
   types. One region, with approximately 2500 m of relief, is located in
   the Japan Alps, central Japan (In a region), where six small
   forest-covered watersheds underlain by granite and Mesozoic shale were
   studied. Two of these watersheds were instrumented to monitor stream
   discharge and the other four are springs occurring at the bedrock
   exposure. The other study area is in northern Kyoto prefecture, western
   Japan (Oe region). Here, spring distribution and seasonal flow were
   monitored in two steep basins underlain by serpentinite rocks.
   Distinctly different runoff responses were observed: the granite
   watershed exhibited a large and rapid runoff peak that coincided with
   the rainfall peak (type 1); and the shale and serpentinite basins
   exhibited small initial runoff peaks followed by a maximum peak
   discharge five to ten times greater with a convex recession limb (type
   2). Runoff response from bedrock springs had characteristics similar to
   type 1 hydrographs; however, discharge increased only when the
   antecedent precipitation index was large and the runoff peak was delayed
   between 10 h and 1 week after rain events. The specific discharge of the
   springs decreased with increase in altitude in the Oe region, especially
   in dry periods. This decline in discharge with elevation suggests that a
   deep subsurface flow system through bedrock fissures contributes to the
   storm water how in serpentinate basins. When comparing runoff response
   and spring discharge, slow or double peak runoff response may be a good
   indicator of the influence of bedrock subsurface outflow on storm runoff
   generation in steep mountainous regions. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Previous research on two experimental catchments at the Glendhu Forest
   (Otago) showed that runoff dynamics from this landscape differ
   substantially from other areas in New Zealand. In particular, the
   recession curves from these catchments have two distinct phases: a rapid
   decline for a period of several hours, followed by a slow decline that
   may last many days to weeks. In the current study, soil water matric
   potential measurements indicated that perched saturated zones develop
   very rapidly in the surface (0-30 cm) soil horizons. Deep (50-250 cm)
   loess horizons remain moist throughout the year and may be near or at
   saturation at the bedrock contact, and respond only slowly to rain
   events. Soils in the middle horizons are often drier than the surface
   soil above or the deep soils below. Throughflow measurements showed that
   storm runoff occurs primarily as interflow through a retentive but
   pervious mat of mosses, litter, and roots at the soil surface. Despite
   the presence of abundant earthworm burrows, less water is transmitted
   through the soil horizon just below this surface mat. Only a small
   fraction of stormflow was transmitted through the deep, mineral
   horizons. However, baseflow could be sustained for long periods (up to 3
   weeks) from unsaturated how of soil moisture stored in the deep loess
   horizons. Water storage in bog peats and associated riparian soils
   (which are numerous in this area) is insufficient to sustain baseflow
   for more than a few days. The results from this study are consistent
   with previous hydrometric, soils, and isotopic observations and suggest
   that any land-use practices that disrupt the surface soil horizons are
   likely to change the runoff characteristics of this area. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{To assess the characteristics of water flow in a tree and the
   contribution of the stem water storage to transpiration, some field
   observations were carried out in two natural forests: a Japanese red
   pine (Pinus densiflora Sieb. et Zucc.) forest and an oak (Quercus
   mongolica Fish) forest. Water potentials of leaf, stem, root and soil
   water, sap flow rate, volumetric water content of the stem and
   micrometeorological factors were measured during the observation
   periods. Clear diurnal variations in volumetric water content of a stem
   were observed. It was confirmed that water storage in the stem
   contributed to the transpiration process. This contribution appeared
   when the difference in water potential between the root and stem was
   more than 0(.)3 MPa. The stem water storage was extracted by the driving
   force due to the difference of the response of the root and stem water
   potential to change in the lear water potential in daytime. The stem
   capacitance of 1(.)44 kg MPa-1 for the Japanese red pine and 0(.)44 kg
   MPa-1 for the oak were evaluated from the variation in the water storage
   in the stem and the difference of water potential between root and stem.
   Evaluations of the water budget were made for each test stand. The
   results indicated that the contribution of water storage in the stem to
   transpiration accounted for 10 to 20\% of the daily transpiration.

Abstract = {{A conceptual framework of hillslope hydrological response patterns and
   their environmental controls is used to evaluate past and present
   research sites in tropical rainforests with regard to their predominant
   controls and hydrological functioning. This evaluation highlights the
   importance of near-surface flowpaths for runoff generation in Acrisol
   landscapes, and lack thereof in Ferralsol landscapes. Both soil types
   tentatively define the width of a spectrum of possible hillslope
   hydrologic flowpaths, from predominantly vertical to predominantly
   lateral flowpaths. This result allows the testing of hypotheses
   concerning the soil geographical occurrence of particular processes of
   runoff generation even where soil hydraulic data are not available.

   index (NDVI) are compared with measured evapotranspiration. These data
   suggest that the vegetation index is a good index of transpiration;
   however, the relationship differs between the growing season and the
   mature period. The reflected brightness in the near-infrared band
   increased during the spring-summer growing season, whereas red
   brightness decreased during the same period. Since the red wavelength
   plays an important role in photosynthetic activity, the data in the red
   band seems to contain information on the physiological activity of the
   grass. In the mature season after summer, the red brightness value
   becomes almost constant and evapotranspiration is best correlated with
   the near-infrared brightness, which is related to incident solar
   radiation. The relationship between NDVI and evapotranspiration should
   be considered separately for the growing and mature seasons because the
   inherent physics in the relationship differs according to phenological
   stages. Understanding the relationship between satellite-derived
   vegetation phenology and surface flux is useful for delineating
   basin-wide hydrological characteristics, since satellite data covers an
   extensive area and the time changes in spectral brightness were found to
   provide information about surface flux. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Hydrobiogeochemical information on forested watersheds in the Japanese
   archipelago is reviewed to qualitatively summarize the major factors
   affecting the hydrology and biogeochemistry of this region. Major
   features that distinguish Japanese forest watersheds from those of north
   central Europe and the northeast United States generally include higher
   temperature, greater precipitation and steeper topography. There have
   been three major themes in hydrobiogeochemistry research on Japanese
   forest ecosystems: (1) investigations of nutrient cycles with particular
   emphasis on the establishment and maintenance of forest ecosystems; (2)
   evaluations of streamwater chemistry as an output from the forest
   ecosystem; and (3) hydrological studies using biogeochemical tracers.
   High precipitation inputs during the growing season affect the
   seasonality of the streamwater NO3- concentration, resulting in
   different temporal patterns than those generally found in north central
   Europe and the northeast United States. The high alkalinity and pH of
   Japanese surface waters is due to the rapid weathering of relatively
   young soils that are generated by steep hillslopes. Warm temperatures
   and elevated soil moisture enhance high rates of mineral weathering.
   Hydrological studies using biogeochemical tracers have shown that the
   steep topography contributes to the highly heterogeneous movement of
   water within Japanese catchments. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{We present here deductions about the location, rate, and mechanisms of
   chemical weathering in a small catchment based on a catchment-scale
   sprinkling experiment. In this experiment demineralized water was
   applied at an approximately steady rate in the CB1 catchment in the
   Oregon Coast Range to reach and maintain a quasi-steady discharge for a
   period of 4 days. Because of nearly steady flow conditions within the
   catchment, the contribution to solute fluxes from soil and bedrock could
   be partitioned. One half of the solute flux from the catchment derived
   from colluvial soil, and one half from weathering in bedrock. This
   implies more intense weathering in the thin colluvium mantling the
   catchment than in the thick underlying weathered bedrock. The annual
   solute flux from the catchment, scaled to the annual runoff from the
   catchment is 32 +/- 10 t km(-2) year(-1), equivalent to published
   chemical denudation rates for nearby rivers with drainage areas 10(6)
   times greater than the experiment site. Soil waters sampled during the
   sprinkling experiment had steady compositions following a period of
   transient water flow conditions, implying steady-state chemical
   evolution in the soil. The waters leached `organic' anions from shallow
   depths in the soil, which solubilized aluminium and iron, indicating
   that podzolization is occurring in these soils. Carbonate dissolution
   appears to be an important source of solutes from the bedrock, despite
   being present as only a minor phase in the rock. Water balance suggests
   that the residence time of water in the catchment is about 2 months, and
   that typical 24 h storms displace only a fraction of the stored water. A
   consequence is that runoff chemistry is dominated by old water, which
   imposes strong limits on the variability of runoff composition.

Abstract = {{When evaluating forest functions and their responses to climate change,
   it is important to clarify carbon dynamics in forested basins. Carbon
   fluxes in litter fall, throughfall, soil solution, groundwater and
   stream water were determined from November 1997 to October 1998 for a
   forest stream ecosystem in a cool-temperate forested basin in the
   Tomakomai Experimental Forest, Hokkaido University, northern Japan. The
   annual carbon input to the stream by litter fall was 0(.)23 gC m(-2)
   year(-1), with the greatest flux in the autumn. Owing to biological
   decomposition of litter in the stream, the carbon concentration in
   stream particulate organic matter (>0(.)45 mum) decreased as particle
   size decreased. The upstream carbon flux was 1(.)9 gC m(-1) year(-1),
   and the annual carbon output in stream water was 7(.)6 gC m(-2)
   year(-1), mainly as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), resulting in net
   carbon output in stream water of 5(.)7 gC m(-2) year(-1). The mean
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in soil solution was higher
   than that in throughfall and stream water. The estimated annual carbon
   flux from soil in deep (about 1(.)5 m) soil solution was 4(.)4 gC m(-1)
   year(-1). About 40\% of DOC in soil solution was decomposed and
   converted to DIC in groundwater. These results indicate that carbon
   dynamics in the forest stream were affected strongly by decomposition of
   organic matter in the soil-groundwater-stream continuum and by the
   hydraulic conditions, which are characterized by a large pool of
   groundwater and high soil permeability. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Long-term field observation of carbon dioxide concentrations in soil air
   and soil temperature and moisture was conducted in a forested (oak and
   Japanese larch) headwater basin. The soil CO2 concentration was measured
   monthly from the ground surface to a depth of 2 m using gas detection
   tubes. The data were then averaged monthly to show general annual
   trends. The temporal and spatial distribution of carbon dioxide showed
   generally constant annual patterns of concentration increase from spring
   to summer and decrease from autumn to winter in response to soil
   temperature changes. The concentration increased exponentially with soil
   temperature greater than or equal to5 degreesC at the same depth,
   suggesting a close relationship between the concentration and production
   of carbon dioxide. From late winter to early spring a frozen layer
   formed at the top of the soil profile that inhibited the escape of
   carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The soil CO2 concentrations in the
   oak forest were generally higher than those in the Japanese larch
   forest, although both soil respiration rate and soil organic carbon
   contents were lower in the oak forest. Considerable interannual
   differences in the distribution of carbon dioxide were observed with
   coincident differences in precipitation. Concentrations at shallow
   depths were relatively low in dry summers. When the frozen layer was not
   formed under thick snow cover, soil CO2 concentration did not increase.
   In deep soils, where the influence of precipitation was not significant,
   the interannual difference was almost always within +/- 20\% of the
   monthly average. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Soil water, spring water and stream water were monitored to investigate
   the behaviour of dissolved loads in relation to subsurface flow
   processes in a steep, high-relief mountainous headwater basin in central
   Japan. Concentrations of Cl-, NO3-, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and SiO2 of hillslope
   soil water are almost the same as those of spring water and stream
   water, whereas concentrations of Ca2+, SO42- and HCO3- in spring water
   and stream water are considerably higher than those in hillslope soil
   water. Clear negative correlations are observed between Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+,
   SO42-, HCO3- and SiO2 concentrations and discharge rate for spring and
   stream waters. These results suggest that stream water chemistry in this
   basin is influenced by subsurface water flowing through bedrock. Dilute,
   short residence subsurface flow through bedrock contributes to the
   stream during high flow periods, and concentrated, long residence
   subsurface flow contributes to the stream during low flow periods. The
   SiO2 data in spring and stream waters indicate that the residence time
   of subsurface water flowing through the bedrock is relatively short in
   this basin compared with that observed in previous studies of other
   basins. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Positive correlations among the concentrations of Sr, Ca and Mg in soil
   water and stream water in a forested volcanic watershed at Kawakami,
   central Japan indicate that the Sr isotope can be used as a tool to
   elucidate the source and transport of the essential terrestrial
   ecosystem nutrients, Ca and Mg. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio in surface soil
   water varied widely along a 74 m slope; it was almost identical to the
   Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of exchangeable soil and existing plants with
   different rooting zones (Japanese oak and bamboo grass), but differed
   significantly from that of soil minerals. In contrast, the Sr-87/Sr-86
   ratios of stream water at baseflow periods were uniform regardless of
   location and time, and were indistinguishable from those of the
   weathered andesite bedrock. The Sr isotopic and elemental data indicate
   that Sr, Ca and possibly other cations (e.g. K, Mg) in the plant cycle
   efficiently with exchangeable soil through soil water and without a
   large supply of cations from secondary soil minerals, while cations in
   stream water are controlled mainly by exchange reactions with bedrock
   derived secondary minerals occurring in the lower soil horizon to water
   saturated zones. It is calculated that about 10\% of Sr and Mg and 20\%
   of Ca in stream water are derived from wet precipitation, while the
   contribution of atmospherically derived Sr and Ca in the exchangeable
   soil pool increases from 22 to 72\% and from 42 to 87\% respectively,
   with increasing distance from the valley. This increase of Sr and Ca in
   the exchangeable soil pool coincides with rock derived, low Ca materials
   dominating in the surface soil of the upper elevation in the slope.

Abstract = {{Runoff sources and dominant flowpaths are still poorly understood in
   most catchments; consequently, most hydrograph separations are
   essentially `black box' models where only external information is used.
   The well-instrumented 490 m(2) Hydrohill artificial grassland catchment
   located near Nanjing (China) was used to examine internal catchment
   processes. Since groundwater levels never reach the soil surface at this
   site, two physically distinct flowpaths can unambiguously be defined:
   surface and subsurface runoff. This study combines hydrometric, isotopic
   and geochemical approaches to investigating the relations between the
   chloride, silica, and oxygen isotopic compositions of subsurface waters
   and rainfall.
   During a 120 mm storm over a 24 h period in 1989, 55\% of event water
   input infiltrated and added to soil water storage; the remainder ran off
   as infiltration-excess overland flow. Only about 3-5\% of the pre-event
   water was displaced out of the catchment by in-storm rainfall. About
   80\% of the total flow was quickflow, and 10\% of the total flow was
   pre-event water, mostly derived from saturated Row from deeper soils.
   Rain water with high delta O-18 values from the beginning of the storm
   appeared to be preferentially stored in shallow soils. Groundwater at
   the end of the storm shows a wide range of isotopic and chemical
   compositions, primarily reflecting the heterogeneous distribution of the
   new and mixed pore waters. High chloride and silica concentrations in
   quickflow runoff derived from event water indicate that these species
   are not suitable conservative tracers of either water sources or
   flowpaths in this catchment. Determining the proportion of event water
   alone does not constrain the possible hydrologic mechanisms sufficiently
   to distinguish subsurface and surface flowpaths uniquely, even in this
   highly controlled artificial catchment. We reconcile these findings with
   a perceptual model of stormflow sources and flowpaths that explicitly
   accounts for water, isotopic, and chemical mass balance. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The geographic sources and hydrologic flow paths of stormflow in small
   catchments are not well understood because of limitations in sampling
   methods and insufficient resolution of potential end members. To address
   these limitations, an extensive hydrologic dataset was collected at a 10
   ha catchment at Panola Mountain Research Watershed near Atlanta, GA, to
   quantify the contribution of three geographic sources of stormflow.
   Samples of stream water, runoff from an outcrop, and hillslope
   subsurface stormflow were collected during two rainstorms in the winter
   of 1996, and an end-member mixing analysis model that included five
   solutes was developed. Runoff from the outcrop, which occupies about
   one-third of the catchment area, contributed 50-55\% of the peak
   streamflow during the 2 February rainstorm, and 80-85\% of the peak
   streamflow during the 6-7 March rainstorm; it also contributed about
   50\% to total streamflow during the dry winter conditions that preceded
   the 6-7 March storm. Riparian groundwater runoff was the largest
   component of stream runoff (80-100\%) early during rising streamflow and
   throughout stream recession, and contributed about 50\% to total stream
   runoff during the 2 February storm, which was preceded by wet winter
   conditions. Hillslope runoff contributed 25-30\% to peak stream runoff
   and 15-18\% to total stream runoff during both storms. The temporal
   response of the three runoff components showed general agreement with
   hydrologic measurements from the catchment during each storm. Estimates
   of recharge from the outcrop to the riparian aquifer that were
   independent of model calculations indicated that storage in the riparian
   aquifer could account for the volume of rain that fell on the outcrop
   but did not contribute to stream runoff. The results of this study
   generally indicate that improvements in the ability of mixing models to
   describe the hydrologic response accurately in forested catchments may
   depend on better identification, and detailed spatial and temporal
   characterization of the mobile waters from the principal hydrologic
   source areas that contribute to stream runoff. Copyright (C) 2001 John

Abstract = {{Models are needed that describe how topography and other watershed
   characteristics affect the chemical composition of runoff waters, yet
   little spatially distributed data exist to develop such models. A
   topographically driven flushing mechanism for nitrate (NO3-) and
   dissolved organic carbon has been described in recent literature;
   however, this mechanism has not yet been thoroughly tested. A 24 ha
   catchment in the Catskill Mountains of New York was clearcut in the
   winter of 1996-97, resulting in elevated NO3- concentrations in soil
   water, groundwater and streamflow. We sampled shallow subsurface
   stormflow (SSSF) and streamflow six times during the spring and summer
   of 1998, 1 year after the harvest. We used a spatially distributed
   network of piezometers to investigate the relationship between
   topography and SSSF chemistry. Several indices of topography were
   computed, including the commonly employed topographic index of Beven and
   Kirkby (1979; Hydrological Sciences Bulletin 24: 43-69). Topographic
   index was positively correlated with NO3- concentrations in SSSF. The
   strength of the NO3--topography relationship was best explained by
   antecedent soil temperature and antecedent precipitation conditions.
   Results suggest a topographically driven flushing of high NO3- shallow
   soil at the site during storm events. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

   100 m below the surface even though a clay layer exists at a depth of 10
   to 20 m. Numerical simulations of changes in solute concentrations of
   groundwater seepage have been made using different values for the
   groundwater capture zone depth. Calculated concentrations agreed well
   with observed ones when the depth of the groundwater capture zone is set
   at 150 m. The combination of the chemical and physical evidence helped

Abstract = {{Hydrological and biogeochemical relationships were evaluated for the
   Arbutus Watershed in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State.
   Wet-only precipitation inputs (weekly) and discharge losses were
   evaluated from 1983 to 1998. Precipitation from 1983-98 had significant
   (p < 0.05) decreases in concentrations of Ca2+ (-0.10 mu mol(c) l(-1)
   year(-1)), Mg2+ (-0.07 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), K+ (-0.01 mu mol(c)
   l(-1) year(-1)), Na+ (-0.04 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), Cl- (-0.07 mu
   mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), SO42- (-0.82 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)) and H+
   (-0.55 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), whereas NH4+ and NO3- concentrations
   did not change. For the same period, there were decreases in solute
   concentrations in the Arbutus Lake outlet for Ca2+ (-1.18 mu mol(c)
   l(-1) year(-1)), Mg2+ (-0.32 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), K+ (-0.33 mu
   mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), Cl- (-0.17 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)) and SO42-
   (-1.90 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)) and a significant increase in NH4+
   concentrations (+0.07 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)). For the period from
   1995 through 1998 the discharge measurements for the outlet and the
   major inlet of Arbutus Lake were combined with weekly chemical
   measurements supplemented with storm sampling. At the inlet there were
   significant relationships (p < 0.05) between discharge rates and the
   concentrations of all solutes except Cl-, but only for Na+, NO3-, H+ and
   Al did these relationships explain more than 20\% of the variation in
   solute concentrations. April had the greatest rates of discharge and
   solute Bur of any month due to spring snowmelt. The dormant season
   (October-May) accounted for > 80\% of the discharge in the inlet and
   outlet of Arbutus Lake and > 78\% of the flux of all solutes. For
   1995-98 the mass balances of discharge losses from the catchment
   draining into Arbutus Lake inlet I versus precipitation inputs suggest
   that internal watershed processes resulted in net generation of Ca2+
   (-1342 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)), Mg2+ (-313 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)), K+
   (-35 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)), SO42- (-635 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)) and
   Cl- (-45 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)) and net retention of inorganic N
   solutes (NO3- + NH4+: 204 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)) and H+ (424 mol(c)
   ha(-1) year(-1)). Concentrations and fluxes of Ca2+, H+, NO3-, SO42- and
   Al were lower at the lake outlet compared with the inlet. A comparison
   of mass balances at the Arbutus Lake inlet and outlet suggested that
   these decreases may have been due to within-lake biotic processes and/or
   dilution from other water sources to the lake. Copyright (C) 2001 John

Abstract = {{Long-term monitoring of rainfall, throughfall and stemflow was conducted
   in a mature Japanese cypress forest at the University Forest in Chiba,
   Bose Peninsula, Japan. Two stemflow collectors were installed in a tree
   at 19.1 m (just under the tree crown) and at 1.3 m above the ground to
   determine the processes controlling the generation, volume and quality
   of stemflow at the stem, leaves and branches. The canopy-only stemflow
   and stem-only stemflow for this tree, and the canopy-and-stem stemflow
   for three other trees, were measured and sampled for chemical analysis.
   Total stemflow increased after installation of the 19.1 m collector just
   under the tree crown, suggesting a large water storage capacity of the
   bark. All ion concentrations: in stemflow except H+ were highest in the
   first sample collected during a rain event and declined thereafter.
   Hydrogen ion concentrations of canopy-only stemflow and canopy-and-stem
   stemflow were nearly balanced with the charge balance deficit (CBD)
   concentrations for all samples. Following comparison of ion
   concentrations among canopy-only stemflow, canopy-and-stem stemflow and
   throughfall, the ions were categorized into four groups (NO3-, SO42-,
   H+, CBD), (Na+, Cl-), (Mg2+, Ca2+) and (K+, NH4+). The groupings were
   based on differences in stemflow and throughfall chemistry generation
   processes between and among the groups. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The redox speciation of dissolved iron and the transport of iron in
   acidic, metal-enriched streams is controlled by precipitation and
   dissolution of iron hydroxides, by photoreduction of dissolved ferric
   iron and hydrous iron oxides, and by oxidation of the resulting
   dissolved ferrous iron. We examined the pH dependence of these processes
   in an acidic mine-drainage stream, St Kevin Gulch, Colorado, by
   experimentally increasing the pH of the stream from about 4.0 to 6.5 and
   following the downstream changes in iron species. We used a solute
   transport model with variable how to evaluate biogeochemical processes
   controlling downstream transport. We found that at pH 6.4 there was a
   rapid and large initial loss of ferrous iron concurrent with the
   precipitation of aluminium hydroxide. Below this reach, ferrous iron was
   conservative during the morning but there was a net downstream loss of
   ferrous iron around noon and in the afternoon. Calculation of net
   oxidation rates shows that the noontime loss rate was generally much
   faster than rates for the ferrous iron oxidation at pH 6 predicted by
   Singer and Stumm (1970. Science 167: 1121). The maintenance of ferrous
   iron concentrations in the morning is explained by the photoreduction of
   photoreactive ferric species, which are then depleted by noon. Copyright

Abstract = {{A new version of the rainfall-runoff model TOPMODEL is described in
   which the assumption of a quasi-steady state saturated zone
   configuration is replaced by a kinematic wave routing of subsurface flow
   implemented in a way that allows the simulation of dynamically variable
   upslope contributing areas. The new version retains the idea of a
   distribution of hydrologically similar points in the catchment but
   allows more flexibility in the definition of hydrologically similarity.
   This allows the new version to retain much of the computational
   efficiency of the original model while still allowing results to be
   mapped back into the space of the catchment. A comparison is gives of
   the original and dynamic versions in an application to the Slapton Wood
   catchment, Devon, UK, within the CLUE methodology. The new version
   provides results that are a better fit to observed discharges, with
   improved prediction bounds, and patterns of predicted deficits storage
   that are qualitatively more consistent with understanding of the
   responses of this catchment. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We present a hierarchically distributed model of catchment forest
   hydrology and biogeochemistry. The goal of the model is to evaluate and
   predict the distribution of water, carbon and nitrogen cycling within a
   forested watershed, as well as the export of nitrate. We use a spatial
   hierarchy of land elements arranged through the stream network, and
   successively containing catchments, subcatchments, hillslopes, then
   patches (within each hillslope) to distribute key processes. Time scales
   of active processes range from those forced by daily meteorology to
   canopy growth and soil development occurring over decades. This allows
   us to follow the hydrological and biogeochemical dynamics of the
   landscape over a range of spatial and temporal scales. A key assumption
   of the model is that a substantial amount of the water movement through
   the unsaturated zone occurs as preferential flow. Nitrate is then
   transported downslope by rising saturated zones during storms. We test
   the predictions of the model with preliminary data generated as part of
   the Baltimore Long-Term Ecological Research site. The hydrological
   modules of the model are calibrated with rainfall/runoff data from the
   1980s, while the nitrogen cycling modules are uncalibrated. The model
   generated good correspondence to the seasonal dynamics of stream water
   nitrate concentration over the 1998-1999 water year. Copyright (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The relationship between concentration c and discharge Q in a stream is
   one of the aspects of hydrochemical catchment response that has been
   used widely as a diagnostic. In particular, loops in the c-e curve,
   commonly referred to as hysteresis loops, are used to infer particular
   mixing patterns. At the South Fork of Brokenback Run (SFBR) in the
   Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, we have evidence that stream
   dynamics reflect a system composed of an ephemeral subsurface stormflow
   zone perched above a perennial water table. The relationship between
   dissolved silica and stream discharge exhibits hysteresis in the
   clockwise (CW) direction. Modelling this relationship in the context of
   three-component mixing with constant-concentration end members failed to
   reproduce the observed c-e pattern. In this paper we examine the
   possibility that temporal variation in soil-water concentrations of
   silica can explain how CW hysteresis loops in the c-e curve can arise.
   In particular, we examine the role of the ratio of a hydrological time
   scale to a chemical time scale in determining the nature of hysteresis
   loops. The CW loops that we observe in SFBR can be explained by time
   variability in soil-water concentrations only if the chemical (leaching)
   time constant is less than (or only slightly greater than) the
   hydrological time constant. The near equality of these time constants is
   consistent with reports from hydrological measurements and leaching
   experiments. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A hallmark of the scientific method is its iterative application to a
   problem to increase and refine the understanding of the underlying
   processes controlling it. A successful iterative application of the
   scientific method to catchment science (including the fields of
   hillslope hydrology and biogeochemistry) has been hindered by two
   factors. First, the scale at which controlled experiments can be
   performed is much smaller than the scale of the phenomenon of interest.
   Second, computer simulation models generally have not been used as
   hypothesis-testing tools as rigorously as they might have been. Model
   evaluation often has gone only so far as evaluation of goodness of fit,
   rather than a full structural analysis, which is more useful when
   treating the model as a hypothesis. An iterative application of a simple
   mixing model to the Panola Mountain Research Watershed is reviewed to
   illustrate the increase in understanding gained by this approach and to
   discern general principles that may be applicable to other studies. The
   lessons learned include the need for an explicitly stated conceptual
   model of the catchment, the definition of objective measures of its
   applicability, and a clear linkage between the scale of observations and
   the scale of predictions. Published in 2001 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Although cohesive suspended sediment is now known to be transported
   primarily as flocculated material, there is still a misconception of
   what constitutes suspended sediment. Flocs represent a complex matrix of
   microbial communities, organic particles (e.g. detritus, extracellular
   polymers and cellular debris), inorganic particles (e.g. clays and
   silts) and substantial interfloc spaces (pores), which allow for the
   retention or flow through of water. Flocculation results in significant
   alteration of the hydrodynamics of the constituent particles (by
   modifying their effective size, shape, density and porosity). thereby
   affecting the transport of sediment and associated contaminants. The
   composition and structure of a flee is in a continuous state of change
   as the medium in which it is transported provides the Roc with further
   building materials, energy, nutrients and chemicals for biological
   growth, chemical reactions and morphological development. As such, a
   floc's physical (e.g. transport), chemical (e.g, contaminant adsorption)
   and biological (community development and contaminant biotransformation)
   behaviour are also in a continuous state of change, with concomitant
   effects on their aquatic environment as a whole. Although it is
   recognized that floc form will influence hoc behaviour, there is still a
   basic lack of knowledge of the complex links between the structural
   components of a hoc and how their individual properties and behaviours
   in combination with others will influence a Roc's physical, chemical and
   biological behaviour. This paper provides a comprehensive conceptual
   model that links the many interrelated structural components of typical
   flocs and their interrelated behavioural aspects, in order to enhance
   our understanding of what constitutes suspended sediment. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{In the Youngcheon Diversion Tunnel area, South Korea, 46 samples of
   tunnel seepage water (TSW) and borehole groundwater were collected from
   areas with sedimentary rocks (mainly sandstone and shale) and were
   examined for hydrogeochemical characteristics. The measured SO4
   concentrations range widely from 7.7 to 942.0 mg/l, and exceed the
   Korean Drinking Water Standard (200 mg/l) in about half the samples. The
   TDS (total dissolved solid) content generally is high (171-1461 mg/l)
   from more shale-rich formations and also reflects varying degrees of
   water-rock interaction. The water is classified into three groups:
   Ca-SO4 type (61\% of the samples collected), Ca-SO4-HCO3 type (15\%) and
   Ca-HCO type (24\%). The Ca-HCO3 type water (mean concentrations = 369
   mg/l Ca, 148 mg/l HCO3 and 23 mg/l SO4) reflected the simple reaction
   between CO2-recharged water and calcite, whereas the more SO4-rich
   nature of Ca-SOI type water (mean concentrations = 153 mg/l Ca, 66 mg/l
   HCO3 and 416 mg/l SO4) reflected the oxidation of pyrite in sedimentary
   rocks and fracture zones. Pyrite oxidation resulted in precipitation of
   amorphous iron hydroxide locally within the tunnel as well as in high
   concentrations of Ca (mean 153 mg/l) and Na (mean 49 mg/l) for TSW, and
   is associated with calcite dissolution resulting in pH buffering. The
   pyrite oxidation required for the formation of Ca-SO4 type water was
   enhanced by the diffusion of oxygenated air through the fractures
   related to the tunnel's construction. The subsequent outgassing of CO2
   into the tunnel resulted in precipitation of iron-bearing carbonate.

Abstract = {{Most precipitation in watersheds is consumed by evaporation, thus
   techniques to appraise regional evaporation are important to assess the
   availability of water resources. Many algorithms to estimate evaporation
   from remotely sensed spectral data have been developed in the recent
   past, in addition to differences in the physical parameterization of
   surface fluxes, these algorithms have different solutions for describing
   spatial variations of the parameters in the
   soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer (SVAT) continuum. In this study, the
   necessity to spatially distinguish SVAT parameters for computing surface
   heat fluxes is analysed thr the Naivasha watershed in the Kenyan Rift
   Valley. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) spectral data have been used to
   first delineate the watershed into 15 hydrological units using surface
   temperature, normalized difference vegetation index and surface albedo
   as attributes. Thereafter, semi-empirical relationships between these
   TM-based parameters and other SVAT parameters have been applied to
   compute the spatial variation of SVAT parameters and the associated
   evaporation from the different hydrological units. The impact of using
   watershed-constant or watershed-distributed SVAT parameters on the
   fluxes is analysed. The determination of watershed averaged evaporation
   with area-aggregated SVAT parameters is feasible without significant
   loss of accuracy. Distributed evaporation in heterogeneous watersheds,
   however, can be investigated only with remote sensing flux algorithms
   that can account for spatially variable air temperature, surface
   roughness, surface albedo and the stability correction of the
   temperature profile due to buoyancy. Erroneous results can be expected
   if area-aggregated SVAT parameters are used to calculate local
   evaporation. As most of the recently developed remote sensing flux
   algorithms are based on areal constant SVAT parameters, direct
   applications in watersheds are still limited. Copyright (C) 2001 John

Abstract = {{The scenario assumed for this study was that of a region with a complete
   or first-order weather station surrounded by a network of second-order
   stations, where only monthly air temperature data were available. The
   objective was to evaluate procedures to estimate the monthly or
   parameter of the Priestley-Taylor equation in the second-order stations
   by adjusting and extrapolating alpha values determined at the
   first-order station. These procedures were applied in two climatic zones
   of north-east Spain with semi-arid continental and semi-arid
   Mediterranean climates, respectively. Procedure A assumed alpha to be
   constant over each zone for each month (direct extrapolation). Procedure
   B accounted for differences in vapour pressure deficit and available
   energy for evapotranspiration between the first- and second-order
   stations. Procedure C was based on equating the Penman-Monteith (P-M)
   and Priestley-Taylor (P-T) equations on a monthly basis to solve for cu.
   Methods to estimate monthly mean vapour pressure deficit, net radiation
   and wind speed were developed and evaluated. A total of 11 automated
   first-order weather stations with a minimum period of record of 6 years
   (ranging from 6 to 10 years) were used for this study. Six of these
   stations were located in the continental zone and five in the
   Mediterranean zone. One station in each zone was assumed to be
   first-order whereas the remainder were taken as second-order stations.
   Monthly alpha parameters were calibrated using P-M reference crop
   evapotranspiration (ET0) values, calculated hourly and integrated for
   monthly periods, which were taken as `true' values of ET0. For the
   extrapolation of monthly alpha parameters, procedure A was found to
   perform slightly better than procedure B in the Mediterranean zone. The
   opposite was true in the continental zone. Procedure C had the worst
   performance owing to the non-linearity of the P-M equation and errors in
   the estimation of monthly available energy, vapour pressure deficit and
   wind speed. Procedures A and B are simpler and performed better.
   Overall, monthly P-T ET0 estimates using extrapolated alpha parameters
   and R-n - C values were in a reasonable agreement with P-M ET0
   calculated on an hourly basis and integrated for monthly periods. The
   methods presented for the spatial extrapolation of monthly available
   energy. vapour pressure deficit and wind speed from first- to
   second-order stations could be useful for other applications. Copyright

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach to improving real-time reservoir
   operation. The approach combines two major procedures: the genetic
   algorithm (GA) and the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system
   (ANFIS). The GA is used to search the optimal reservoir operating
   histogram based on a given inflow series, which can be recognized as the
   base of input-output training patterns in the next step. The ANFIS is
   then built to create the fuzzy inference system, to construct the
   suitable structure and parameters, and to estimate the optimal water
   release according to the reservoir depth and inflow situation. The
   practicability and effectiveness of the approach proposed is tested on
   the operation of the Shihmen reservoir in Taiwan. The current M-5
   operating rule curves of the Shihmen reservoir are also evaluated. The
   simulation results demonstrate that this new approach, in comparison
   with the M-5 rule curves, has superior performance with regard to the
   prediction of total water deficit and generalized shortage index (GSI).

Title = {{Hysteresis-based flood-wave analysis using the concept of strain}},

Year = {{2001}},

Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1635-1651}},

Abstract = {{Hysteresis represents a loop in a rating curve and is a phenomenon which
   closely resembles that occurring in stress-strain curves used for
   studying the elastic properties of solid substances in engineering
   mechanics. Earlier hysteresis-based studies used for defining floodwave
   propagation in open channels have qualitatively shown that hysteresis is
   an index of energy loss during floodwave propagation. Using the concept
   of elasticity, this paper introduces a new term called flow strain
   (defined as the ratio of change in discharge to the initial discharge)
   for investigating hysteresis. The usefulness of this new term is
   evaluated with use of four dam-break studies. The study reveals that:
   1. flow strain is a function of three wave speeds, Seddon speed,
   Lagrange speed, and elastic speed;
   2. a single linear reservoir concept frequently used in flood routing is
   a specific variant of the Seddon speed formula;
   3. the non-linear storage-discharge relationship, widely used in
   overland flow modelling, is a variant of the kinematic wave
   representation;
   4. the discharge ordinates on the recession part of a hydrograph follow

Abstract = {{This paper explores the behaviour and sensitivity of a watershed model
   used for simulating lateral soil water redistribution and runoff
   production. In applications such as modelling the effects of land-use
   change in small headwater catchments, interactions between soil
   moisture, runoff and ecological processes are important. Because
   climate, soil and canopy characteristics are spatially variable, both
   the pattern of soil moisture and the associated outflow must be
   represented in modelling these processes. This study compares implicit
   and explicit routing approaches to modelling the evolution of soil
   moisture pattern and spatially variable runoff production. It also
   addresses the implications of using different landscape partitioning
   strategies. This study presents the results of calibration and
   application of these different routing and landscape partitioning
   approaches on a 60 ha forested watershed in Western Oregon. For
   comparison, the different approaches are incorporated into a physically
   based hydro-ecological model, RHESSys, and the resulting simulated soil
   moisture, runoff production and sensitivity to unbiased error are
   examined. Results illustrate that both routing approaches can be
   calibrated to achieve a reasonable fit between observed and modelled
   outflow. Calibrated values for effective watershed hydraulic
   conductivity are higher for the explicit routing approach, which
   illustrates differences between the two routing approaches in their
   representation of internal watershed dynamics. The explicit approach
   illustrates a seasonal shift in drainage organization from watershed to
   more local control as climate goes from a winter wet to a summer dry
   period. Assumptions used in the implicit approach maintain the same
   pattern of drainage organization throughout the season. The implicit
   approach is also more sensitive to random error in soil and topographic
   input information, particularly during wetter periods. Comparison
   between the two routing approaches illustrates the advantage of the
   explicit routing approach, although the loss of computational efficiency
   associated with the explicit routing approach is noted. To compare
   different strategies for partitioning the landscape, the use of a
   non-grid-based method of partitioning is introduced and shown to be
   comparable to grid-based partitioning in terms of simulated soil
   moisture and runoff production. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{For the period from 1958 to 1996, streamflow characteristics of a highly
   urbanized watershed were compared with less-urbanized and non-urbanized
   watersheds within a 20000 km(2) region in the vicinity of Atlanta,
   Georgia: in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge physiographic provinces of the
   southeastern USA. Water levels in several wells completed in surficial
   and crystalline-rock aquifers were also evaluated. Data were analysed
   for seven US Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauges, 17 National Weather
   Service rain gauges, and five USGS monitoring wells. Annual runoff
   coefficients (RCs; runoff as a fractional percentage of precipitation)
   for the urban stream (Peachtree Creek) were not significantly greater
   than for the less-urbanized watersheds. The RCs for some streams were
   similar to others and the similar streams were grouped according to
   location. The RCs decreased from the higher elevation and higher relief
   watersheds to the lower elevation and lower relief watersheds: values
   were 0.54 for the two Blue Ridge streams, 0.37 for the four middle
   Piedmont streams (near Atlanta), and 0.28 for a southern Piedmont
   stream. For the 25 largest stormflows, the peak flows for Peachtree
   Creek were 30\% to 100\% greater than peak flows for the other streams.
   The storm recession period for the urban stream was 1-2 days less than
   that for the other streams and the recession was characterized by a
   2-day storm recession constant that was, on average, 40 to 100\%
   greater, i.e. streamflow decreased more rapidly than for the other
   streams Baseflow recession constants ranged from 35 to 40\% lower for
   Peachtree Creek than for the other streams; this is attributed to lower
   evapotranspiration losses, which result in a smaller change in
   groundwater storage than in the less-urbanized watersheds. Low how of
   Peachtree Creek ranged from 25 to 35\% less than the other streams,
   possibly the result of decreased infiltration caused by the more
   efficient routing of stormwater and the paving of groundwater recharge
   areas. The timing of daily or monthly groundwater-level fluctuations was
   similar annually in each well, reflecting the seasonal recharge.
   Although water-level monitoring only began in the 1980s for the two
   urban wells, water levels displayed a notable decline compared with
   non-urban wells since then; this is attributed to decreased groundwater
   recharge in the urban watersheds due to increased imperviousness and
   related rapid storm runoff. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The water and energy exchanges in forests form one of the most important
   hydro-meteorological systems. There have been far fewer investigations
   of the water and heat exchange in high latitude forests than of those in
   warm. humid regions. There have been few observations of this system in
   Siberia for an entire growing season, including the snowmelt and
   leaf-fall seasons. In this study, the characteristics of the energy and
   water budgets in an eastern Siberian larch forest were investigated from
   the snowmelt season to the leaf-fall season. The latent heat flux was
   strongly affected by the transpiration activity of the larch trees and
   increased quickly as the larch stand began to foliate. The sensible heat
   dropped at that time, although the net all wave radiation increased.
   Consequently, the seasonal variation in the Bowen ratio was clearly
   `U'-shaped. and the minimum value (1.0) occurred in June and July. The
   Bowen ratio was very high (10-25) in early spring, just before leaf
   opening. The canopy resistance for a big leaf model far exceeded the
   aerodynamic resistance and fluctuated over a much wider range. The
   canopy resistance was strongly restricted by the saturation deficit, and
   its minimum value was 100 s m(-1) (10 mm s(-1) in conductance). This
   minimum canopy resistance is higher than values obtained for forests in
   warm, humid regions, but is similar to those measured in other boreal
   conifer forests. It has been suggested that the senescence of Leaves
   also affects the canopy resistance, which was higher in the leaf-fall
   season than in the foliated season. The mean evapotranspiration rate
   from 21 April 1998 to 7 September 1998 was 1.16 mm day(-1). and the
   maximum rate, 2.9 mm day(-1), occurred at the beginning of July. For the
   growing season from 1 June to 31 August, this rate was 1.5 mm day(-1).
   The total evapotranspiration from the forest (151 mm) exceeded the
   amount of precipitation (106 mm) and was equal to 73\% of the total
   water input (211 mm), including the snow water equivalent. The
   understory evapotranspiration reached 35\% of the total
   evapotranspiration, and the interception evaporation was 15\% of the
   gross precipitation. The understory evapotranspiration was high and the
   interception evaporation was low because the canopy was sparse and the
   leaf area index was low. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Soil and water conservation practices have been promoted for a Long
   time, in order to sustain agricultural activities and prevent
   environmental pollution. Vegetated filter strips (VFS) have been used to
   reduce sediment pollution into water bodies at or near the pollutant
   source. However, factors effecting VFS performance under natural
   conditions have not been well understood owing to the physical, time and
   financial limitations of field experiments. The use of well-validated
   simulation models to understand the performance of VFS and factors
   affecting sediment deposition is highly justified. The objective of this
   research is to investigate sediment trapping in VFS and to study various
   factors affecting VFS performance using the simulation model VFSMOD,
   which was developed by researchers at University of North Carolina.
   Recently. VFSMOD has been validated successfully by using 21 filters
   with varying length, slope and vegetated cover. A wide range of five
   parameters was selected for the simulations, namely filter length,
   filter slope, manning roughness coefficient, soil type and
   characteristics of incoming sediment from adjacent fields. Computer
   simulations revealed that the length of filter is the most significant
   factor affecting sediment trapping in VFS. The relative increase in
   trapping efficiencies was not linearly related to an increase in filter
   length. Inflow sediment class also has a major influence on sediment
   trapping in VFS. The trapping efficiency of clay sediments in a 15 m
   length VFS was 47\% compared with 92\% for silt from incoming sediment.
   Manning roughness coefficient had a moderate effect on sediment trapping
   and was more significant in short filters. Land slope and soil type of
   VFS had a minor influence on the performance of VFS. Copyright (C) 2001

Abstract = {{A study of Rostherne Mere (Cheshire, UK) was undertaken to reveal
   relationships among various ecosystem components and assess the progress
   in lake recovery following sewage diversion. An intensive monitoring
   programme included measurements of dissolved oxygen. T, pH, electric
   conductivity, K, Mg, Ca, Si, N and P species, Secchi depth, suspended
   solids, chlorophyll-a, phyto- and zooplankton counts. Recorded changes
   and the results of correlation analysis broadly confirmed to the classic
   limnoecological theory and allowed detailed interpretation of the
   dynamics observed. The Si level was used to estimate the amount of
   diatom detritus produced in spring. Chemical profiles were used to
   estimate the amount of nutrients ac:cumulated in the hypolimnion during
   the stratified period. These estimates were compared with simulations
   made using the model of exponential decay, which showed a good
   performance in the case of Si but considerable underestimation in the
   case of P. The differences between the values simulated by the model and
   estimates based on field observations resulted from the additional P
   release from the sediments. This release could have been stimulated by a
   combination of factors, including the development of anoxic layers on
   the sediment-water interface and Si-induced desorption from Fe, Al and
   Mn oxides. Internal P loading during the stratified period was thus
   estimated at about 4-9 g/m(2), suggesting that rapid changes in the
   lake's trophic status are at present unlikely. Certain aspects of this
   work (including interpretation of interrelationships between ecosystem
   components, estimation of the decomposition constant. analysis of
   factors controlling nutrient accumulation in the hypolimnion, and a
   low-cost method to estimate intern; l P release) may be useful for
   studies of other aquatic systems and have, therefore, general
   limnological applicability. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The potential benefits of increased application of water to paddy fields
   in Taiwan are investigated in this paper. A conceptual model is used to
   represent the hydrological system of the paddy field. A technique is
   presented to estimate the parameters of the model. Field experiments
   also are performed for parameter estimation and model verification. The
   simulated results are in good agreement with the observed during model
   verification. With parameters estimated from the field data, the model
   is used to simulate the effects of applying water beyond current
   practice. The simulation results show that the downward percolation
   increases when the irrigation water increases. However, the percolation
   reaches a capacity rate no matter how large die amount of water applied.
   This phenomenon results from the existence of a hard layer below the
   paddy field. The effects of raising the height of levees around paddy
   fields are also studied. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating the annual mass flux at a network of fixed stations is one
   approach to characterizing water quality of large rivers. The
   interpretive context provided by annual flux includes identifying source
   and sink areas for constituents and estimating the loadings to receiving
   waters, such as reservoirs or the ocean. Since 1995, the US Geological
   Survey's National Stream Quality Accounting Network (NASQAN) has
   employed this approach at a network of 39 stations in four of the
   largest river basins of the USA: the Mississippi, the Columbia, the
   Colorado and the Rio Grande. In this paper, the design of NASQAN is
   described and its effectiveness at characterizing the water quality of
   these rivers is evaluated using data from the first 3 years of
   operation. A broad range of constituents was measured by NASQAN,
   including trace organic and inorganic chemicals, major ions, sediment
   and nutrients. Where possible, a regression model relating concentration
   to discharge and season was used to interpolate between chemical
   observations for flux estimation, For water-quality network design, the
   most important finding from NASQAN was the importance of having a
   specific objective (that is, estimating annual mass flux) and, from
   that, an explicitly stated data analysis strategy, namely the use of
   regression models to interpolate between observations. The use of such
   models aided in the design of sampling strategy and provided a context
   for data review. The regression models essentially form null hypotheses
   for concentration variation that can be evaluated by the observed data.
   The feedback between network operation and data collection established
   by the hypothesis tests places the water-quality network on a firm
   scientific footing.}},

Abstract = {{In 1994, the NASQAN (National Stream Quality Accounting Network)
   programme was redesigned as a flux-based water-quality monitoring
   network for the Mississippi, Columbia, Colorado, and Rio Grande Basins.
   As the new programme represented a departure from the original, new
   sampling, processing, analytical, and data handling procedures had to be
   selected/developed to provide data on discharge, suspended sediment
   concentration, and the concentrations of suspended sediment and
   dissolved trace elements.
   Annual suspended sediment fluxes were estimated by summing daily
   instantaneous fluxes based on predicted suspended sediment
   concentrations derived from discharge-based log-log regression
   (rating-curve) models. The models were developed using both historical
   and current site-specific discharge and suspended sediment
   concentrations. Errors using this approach typically are less than +/-
   10\% for the 3-year reporting period however, the magnitude of the
   errors increases substantially for temporal spans shorter than 1 year.
   Total, rather than total-recoverable, suspended sediment-associated
   trace element concentrations were determined by direct analysis of
   material dewatered from large-volume whole-water samples. Site-specific
   intra- and inter-annual suspended sediment-associated chemical
   variations were less (typically by no more than a factor of two) than
   those for either discharge or suspended sediment concentrations (usually
   more than 10-fold). The concentrations, hence the annual fluxes, for
   suspended sediment-associated phosphorus and organic carbon, determined
   by direct analyses, were higher than those determined using a more
   traditional paired, whole-water/filtered-water approach (by factors
   ranging from 15- to 10-fold). This may be important for such issues as
   eutrophication and coastal productivity.
   Filtered water-associated (dissolved) trace element concentrations were
   markedly lower than those determined during the historical NASQAN
   programme; many were below their respective detection limits. This
   resulted from the use of clean sampling, processing, and analytical
   protocols. Hence, the fluxes for filtered water-associated (dissolved)
   Ag, Pb, Co, V, Be, Sb, and Se, as well as the total (filtered water plus
   suspended sediment-associated) fluxes for these constituents, could not
   be estimated.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal estimators are developed for computation of suspended-sediment
   concentrations in streams. The estimators are a function of parameters,
   computed by use of generalized least squares, which simultaneously
   account for effects of streamflow, seasonal variations in average
   sediment concentrations, a dynamic error component, and the uncertainty
   in concentration measurements. The parameters are used in a Kalman
   filter for on-line estimation and an associated smoother for off-line
   estimation of suspended-sediment concentrations. The accuracies of the
   optimal estimators are compared with alternative time-averaging
   interpolators and flow-weighting regression estimators by use of
   long-term daily-mean suspended-sediment concentration and streamflow
   data from 10 sites within the United States. For sampling intervals from
   3 to 48 days, the standard errors of on-line and off-line optimal
   estimators ranged from 52.7 to 107\%, and from 39.5 to 93.0\%,
   respectively. The corresponding standard errors of linear and
   cubic-spline interpolators ranged from 48.8 to 158\%, and from 50.6 to
   176\%, respectively. The standard errors of simple and multiple
   regression estimators, which did not vary with the sampling interval,
   were 124 and 105\%, respectively. Thus, the optimal off-line estimator
   (Kalman smoother) had the lowest error characteristics of those
   evaluated. Because suspended-sediment concentrations are typically
   measured at less than 3-day intervals, use of optimal estimators will
   likely result in significant improvements in the accuracy of continuous
   suspended-sediment concentration records. Additional research on the
   integration of direct suspended-sediment concentration measurements and
   optimal estimators applied at hourly or shorter intervals is needed.}},

Abstract = {{Suspended sediment, sediment-associated, total trace element, phosphorus
   (P), and total organic carbon (TOC) fluxes were determined for the
   Mississippi, Columbia, Rio Grande, and Colorado Basins for the study
   period (the 1996, 1997, and 1998 water years) as part of the US
   Geological Survey's redesigned National Stream Quality Accounting
   Network (NASQAN) programme. The majority (greater than or equal to 70\%)
   of Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni, Ba, P, As, Fe, Mn, and Al are transported in
   association with suspended sediment; Sr transport seems dominated by the
   dissolved phase, whereas the transport of Li and TOC seems to be divided
   equally between both phases. Average dissolved trace element levels are
   markedly lower than reported during the original NASQAN programme; this
   seems due to the use of `clean' sampling, processing, and analytical
   techniques rather than to improvements in water quality. Partitioning
   between sediment and water for Ag, Pb, Cd, Cr, Co, V, Be, As, Sb, Hg and
   Ti could not be estimated due to a lack of detectable dissolved
   concentrations in most samples.
   Elevated suspended sediment-associated Zn levels were detected in the
   Ohio River Basin and elevated Hg levels were detected in the Tennessee
   River, the former may affect the mainstem Mississippi River, whereas the
   latter probably do not. Sediment-associated concentrations of Ag, Cu,
   Pb, Zn, Cd, Cr, Co, Ba, Mo, Sb, Hg, and Fe are markedly elevated in the
   upper Columbia Basin, and appear to be detectable (Zn, Cd) as far
   downstream as the middle of the basin. These elevated concentrations
   seem to result from mining and/or mining-related activities.
   Consistently detectable concentrations of dissolved Se were found only
   in the Colorado River Basin.
   Calculated average annual suspended sediment fluxes at the mouths of the
   Mississippi and Rio Grande Basins were below, whereas those for the
   Columbia and Colorado Basins were above previously published annual
   values. Downstream suspended sediment-associated and total trace element
   fluxes increase in the Mississippi and Columbia Basins, whereas fluxes
   markedly decrease in the Colorado Basin. No consistent pattern in trace
   element fluxes was detected in the Rio Grande Basin.}},

Abstract = {{Current and historical data show that nitrogen concentrations and flux
   in the Mississippi River Basin have increased significantly during the
   past 100 years. Most of the increase observed in the lower Mississippi
   River has occurred since the early 1970s and is due almost entirely to
   an increase in nitrate. The current (1980-99) average annual nitrogen
   (N) flux from the Mississippi Basin to the Gulf of Mexico is about 1 555
   500 t year(-1), of which about 62\% is nitrate-N. The remaining 38\% is
   organic nitrogen and a small amount of ammonium. The current (1980-99)
   average nitrate flux to the Gulf is almost three times larger than it
   was during 1955-70. This increased supply of nitrogen to the Gulf is
   believed to be partly responsible for the increasing size of a large
   hypoxic zone that develops along the Louisiana-Texas shelf each summer.
   This zone of oxygen-depleted water has doubled in areal extent since it
   was first measured in 1985. The increase in annual nitrate flux to the
   Gulf can be largely explained by three factors: increased fertilizer
   use, annual variability in precipitation and increased streamflow, and
   the year-to-year variability in the amount of nitrogen available in the
   soil-ground water system for leaching to streams. The predominant source
   areas for the nitrogen transported to the Gulf of Mexico are basins
   draining southern Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. Basins
   in this region yield 1801 to 3050 kg N km(-2) year(-1) to streams,
   several times the N yield of basins outside this region.}},

Abstract = {{Regional transport of water and dissolved constituents through heavily
   regulated river systems is influenced by the presence of reservoirs.
   Analysis of seasonal patterns in solute fluxes for salinity and
   nutrients indicates that in-reservoir processes within large storage
   reservoirs in the Rio Grande and Colorado basins (southwestern USA) are
   superimposed over the underlying watershed processes that predominate in
   relatively unregulated stream reaches. Connectivity of the aquatic
   system with the landscape is apparently disrupted by processes within
   the reservoir systems; these processes result in large changes in
   characteristics for solute transport that persist downstream in the
   absence of significant inputs. Additionally, reservoir processes may be
   linked for upstream/downstream reservoirs that are located relatively
   close in a series. In contrast, the regional effect of in-reservoir
   processes is negligible for solute transport through run-of-river
   reservoirs in the lower Columbia River (northwestern USA).}},

Abstract = {{A portion of applied pesticides runs off agricultural fields and is
   transported through surface waters. In this study, the behaviour of 39
   pesticides is examined as a function of scale across 14 orders of
   magnitude from the field to the ocean. Data on pesticide loads in
   streams from two US Geological Survey programs were combined with
   literature data from field and watershed studies. The annual load as
   percent of use (LAPU) was quantified for each of the fields and
   watersheds and was used as the normalization factor across watersheds
   and compounds. The in-stream losses of each pesticide were estimated for
   a model stream with a 15 day travel time (similar in characteristics to
   the upper Mississippi River). These estimated in-stream losses agreed
   well with the observed changes in apparent LAPU values as a function of
   watershed area. In general, herbicides applied to the soil surface had
   the greatest LAPU values and minimal in-stream losses. Soil-incorporated
   herbicides had smaller LAPU values and substantial in-stream losses.
   Insecticides generally had LAPU values similar to the incorporated
   herbicides, but had more variation in their in-stream losses. On the
   basis of the LAPU values of the 39 pesticides as a function of watershed
   area, a generalized conceptual model of the movement of pesticides from
   the field to the ocean is suggested. The importance of considering both
   field runoff and in-stream losses is discussed in relation to
   interpreting monitoring data and making regulatory decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Persistent hydrophobic organic compounds are of concern in the Columbia
   River because they have been correlated with adverse effects on
   wildlife. We analysed samples from nine main-stem and six tributary
   sites throughout the Columbia River Basin (Washington and Oregon) for
   polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans, polychlorinated
   biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, and priority-pollutant polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons. Because these compounds may have important
   biological consequences at aqueous concentrations well below the
   detection limits associated with conventional sampling methods, we used
   semipermeable-membrane devices to sample water and achieved parts-per
   quintillion detection limits. All of these compound classes were
   prevalent within the basin, but concentrations of many analytes were
   highest in the vicinity of Portland-Vancouver, indicating that the
   Willamette subbasin - and perhaps the urban area in particular - is an
   important source of these compounds. Data collected during basin
   low-flow conditions in 1997 and again during basin high-flow conditions
   in 1998 indicate that in-stream processes such as dilution by relatively
   clean inflows, and flow through island hyporheic zones may be important
   mechanisms for attenuating dissolved concentrations of hydrophobic
   compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrate (NO3) and other nutrients discharged by the Mississippi River
   are suspected of causing a zone of depleted dissolved oxygen (hypoxic
   zone) in the Gulf of Mexico each summer. The hypoxic zone may have an
   adverse affect on aquatic life and commercial fisheries. The amount of
   NO3 delivered by the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico is well
   documented, but the relative contributions of different sources of NO3,
   and the magnitude of subsequent in-stream transformations of NO3, are
   not well understood. Forty-two water samples collected in 1997 and 1998
   at eight stations located either on the Mississippi River or its major
   tributaries were analysed for NO3, total nitrogen (N), atrazine,
   chloride concentrations and NO3 stable isotopes (delta N-15, delta
   O-18). These data are used to assess the magnitude and nature of
   in-stream N transformation and to determine if the delta N-15 and delta
   O-18 of NO3 provide information about NO3 sources and transformation
   processes in a large river system (drainage area similar to2 900 000
   km(2)) that would otherwise be unavailable using concentration and
   discharge data alone.
   Results from 42 samples indicate that the delta N-15 and delta O-18
   ratios between sites on the Mississippi River and its tributaries are
   somewhat distinctive, and vary with season and discharge rate. Of
   particular interest are two nearly Lagrangian sample sets, in which
   samples from the Mississippi River at St Francisville, LA, are compared
   with samples collected from the Ohio River at Grand Chain, II, and the
   Mississippi River at Thebes, IL. In both Lagrangian sets, mass-balance
   calculations indicate only a small amount of in-stream N loss. The
   stable isotope data from the samples suggest that in-stream N
   assimilation and not denitrification accounts for most of the N loss in
   the lower Mississippi River during the spring and early summer months.}},

Abstract = {{Riverine particulate organic matter (POM) samples were collected
   bi-weekly to monthly from 40 sites in the Mississippi, Colorado, Rio
   Grande, and Columbia River Basins (USA) in 1996-97 and analysed for
   carbon and nitrogen stable isotopic compositions. These isotopic
   compositions and C:N ratios were used to identify four endmember sources
   of POM: plankton, fresh terrestrial plant material, aquatic plants, and
   soil organic material. This large-scale study also incorporated
   ancillary chemical and hydrologic data to refine and extend the
   interpretations of POM sources beyond the source characterizations that
   could be done solely with isotopic and elemental ratios. The ancillary
   data were especially useful for differentiating between seasonal changes
   in POM source materials and the effects of local nutrient sources and
   in-stream biogeochemical processes.
   Average values of delta C-13 and C:N for all four river systems
   suggested that plankton is the dominant source of POM in these rivers,
   with higher percentages of plankton downstream of reservoirs. Although
   the temporal patterns in some rivers are complex, the low delta C-13 and
   C:N values in spring and summer probably indicate plankton blooms,
   whereas relatively elevated values in fall and winter are consistent
   with greater proportions of decaying aquatic vegetation and/or
   terrestrial material. Seasonal shifts in the delta C-31 of POM when the
   C:N remains relatively constant probably indicate changes in the
   relative rates of photosynthesis and respiration. Periodic inputs of
   plant detritus are suggested by C:N ratios > 15, principally on the
   Columbia and Ohio Rivers. The delta N-15, delta C-13 also reflect the
   importance of internal and external sources of dissolved carbon and
   nitrogen, and the degree of in-stream processing. Elevated delta N-13
   values at some sites probably reflect inputs from sewage and/or animal
   waste. This information on the spatial and temporal variation in sources
   of POM in four major river systems should prove useful in future food
   web and nutrient transport studies.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of ecological restoration efforts on large developed
   rivers is often unknown because comprehensive ecological monitoring
   programs are often absent. Although Eulerian water-quality monitoring
   programs, such as the National Stream Quality Accounting Network
   (NASQAN) program, are more common, they are usually not designed for
   ecological assessment. Therefore, this paper addresses the value of
   NASQAN for ecological assessments on the Missouri River and identifies
   potential program additions and modifications to assess certain
   ecological changes in physical habitat, biological structure and
   function, and ecotoxicity.
   Five additional sites; the analysis of chlorophyll, mercury, ATP,
   potential endocrine disrupters, total trace elements, and selected total
   hydrophobic organics; and the hourly measurement of dissolved oxygen,
   turbidity, and temperature are recommended. Hourly measurements would
   require an entirely new operational aspect to NASQAN. However, the
   presence of data loggers and satellite transmitters in the gauging
   stations at all NASQAN sites substantially improves the feasibility of
   continuous water-quality monitoring. The use of semipermeable membrane
   devices (SPMDs) to monitor dissolved bioaccumulating organics and trace
   elements, identification and enumeration of zooplankton, and
   characterization of the bioavailability of organic matter are also
   recommended.
   The effect of biological processes on the conservative assumptions that
   are used in flux and source determinations of NASQAN constituents are
   also evaluated. Organic carbon, organic nitrogen, dissolved phosphate,
   and dissolved inorganic nitrogen are the NASQAN constituents most
   vulnerable to biological processes and thus violation of conservative
   assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{Reconstruction of continental palaeoclimate and palaeohydrology is
   currently hampered by limited information about isotopic patterns in the
   modern hydrologic cycle. To remedy this situation and to provide
   baseline data for other isotope hydrology studies, more than 4800,
   depth- and width-integrated, stream samples from 391 selected sites
   within the USGS National Stream Quality Accounting Network (NASQAN) and
   Hydrologic Benchmark Network (HBN) were analysed for delta O-18 and
   delta H-2 (http://water.usgs.gov/pubs/ofr/ofr00-160/pdf/ofr00-160.pdf).
   Each site was sampled bimonthly or quarterly for 2.5 to 3 years between
   1984 and 1987. The ability of this dataset to serve as a proxy for the
   isotopic composition of modem precipitation in the USA is supported by
   the excellent agreement between the river dataset and the isotopic
   compositions of adjacent precipitation monitoring sites, the strong
   spatial coherence of the distributions of delta O-18 and delta H-2, the
   good correlations of the isotopic compositions with climatic parameters,
   and the good agreement between the `national' meteoric water line (MWL)
   generated from unweighted analyses of samples from the 48 contiguous
   states of delta H-2 = 8.11 delta O-18 + 8.99 (r(2) = 0.98) and the
   unweighted global MWL of sites from the Global Network for Isotopes in
   Precipitation (GNIP) of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the
   World Meteorological Organization (WMO) of delta H-2 = 8.17 delta O-18 +
   10.35. The national MWL is composed of water samples that arise in
   diverse local conditions where the local meteoric water lines (LMWLs)
   usually have much lower slopes. Adjacent sites often have similar LMWLs,
   allowing the datasets to be combined into regional MWLs. The slopes of
   regional MWLs probably reflect the humidity of the local air mass, which
   imparts a distinctive evaporative isotopic signature to rainfall and
   hence to stream samples. Deuterium excess values range from 6 to 15\% in
   the eastern half of the USA, along the northwest coast and on the
   Colorado Plateau. In the rest of the USA, these values range from -2 to
   6\%, with strong spatial correlations with regional aridity. The river
   samples have successfully integrated the spatial variability in the
   meteorological cycle and provide the best available dataset on the
   spatial distributions of delta O-18 and delta H-2 values of meteoric
   waters in the USA.}},

Abstract = {{Tn determine how soil frost changes flowpaths of runoff water along a
   hillslope, a transect consisting of four soil profiles directed towards
   a small stream in a mature forest stand was investigated at Svartberget,
   near Vindeln in northern Sweden. Soil temperature, unfrozen water
   content, groundwater level and snow depth were investigated along the
   transect, which started at the riparian peat, and extended 30 m upslope
   into mineral soils. The two, more organic-rich profiles closest to the
   stream had higher water retention and wetter autumn conditions than the
   sandy mineral soils further upslope, The organic content of the soil
   influenced the variation in frost along the transect. The first winter
   (1995-96) had abnormally low snow precipitation, which gave a deep frost
   down to 40-80 cm, whereas the two following winters had frost depths of
   5-20 cm. During winter 1995-96, the two organic profiles close to the
   stream had a shallower frost depth than the mineral soil profile higher
   upslope, but a considerably larger amount of frozen water. The fraction
   of water that did not freeze despite several minus degrees in the soil
   was 5-7 vol.\% in the mineral soil and 10-15 vol.\% in the organic soil.
   From the measurements there were no signs of perched water tables during
   any of the three snowmelt periods, which would have been strong evidence
   for changed water flowpaths due to soil frost. When shallow soil layers
   became saturated during snowmelt, especially in 1997 and 1998, it was
   because of rising groundwater levels. Several rain on frozen ground
   events during spring 1996 resulted in little runoff, since most of the
   rain either froze in the soil or filled up the soil water storage.

   three winter seasons (1995-98) it was able to predict the onset and
   total accumulation of the runoff with satisfactory accuracy. Surface
   runoff was identified as only a minor fraction of the total runoff
   occurring during short periods in connection with ice blocking of the
   water-conducting pores. Little surface runoff, though, does not mean
   that soil frost is unimportant for spring runoff. Simulations without
   frost routines systematically underestimated the total accumulated
   runoff. The possibility of major frost effects appearing in response to
   specific combinations of weather conditions were also tested. Different
   scenarios of critical initial conditions for the winter, e.g, high water
   saturation and delayed snow accumulation leading to an increased frost
   penetration, were tested. These showed that under special circumstances
   there is potential for increased spring runoff due to soil frost.

Abstract = {{Applications of the ideas gained from fractal theory to characterize
   rainfall have been one of the most exciting ai eas of research in recent
   times. The studies conducted thus far have nearly unanimously yielded
   positive evidence regarding the existence of fractal behaviour in
   rainfall. The studies also revealed the insufficiency of the
   mono-fractal approaches to characterizing the rainfall process in time
   and space and, hence, the necessity for multi-fractal approaches. The
   assumption behind multi-fractal approaches for rainfall is that the
   variability of the rainfall process could be directly modelled as a
   stochastic (or random) turbulent cascade process, since such stochastic
   cascade processes were found to generically yield multi-fractals.
   However, it has been observed recently that multi-fractal approaches
   might provide positive evidence of a multi-fractal nature not only in
   stochastic processes but also in, for example, chaotic processes. The
   purpose of the present study is to investigate the presence of both
   chaotic and fractal behaviours in the rainfall process to consider the
   possibility of using a chaotic multi-fractal approach for rainfall
   characterization. For this purpose, daily rainfall data observed at the
   Leaf River basin in Mississippi are studied, and only temporal analysis
   is carried out. The autocorrelation function, the power spectrum, the
   empirical probability distribution function, and the statistical moment
   scaling function are used as indicators to investigate the presence of
   fractal, whereas the presence of chaos is investigated by employing the
   correlation dimension method. The results from the fractal
   identification methods indicate that the rainfall data exhibit
   multi-fractal behaviour. Thr correlation dimension method yields a low
   dimension, suggesting the presence of chaotic behaviour. The existence
   of both multi-fractal and chaotic behaviours in the rainfall data
   suggests the possibility of a chaotic multi-fractal approach for
   rainfall characterization. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Evapotranspiration was studied at a salt marsh site in the Hunter River
   estuary, NSW, Australia, during 1996-8. Estimates of actual
   evapotranspiration if,) were obtained for three sites using the eddy
   correlation method. These values were compared with results obtained
   with the Penman anti Penman-Monteith equations, and with Fan
   evaporation. The Penman-Monteith method was found to be most reliable in
   estimating daily and hourly evapotranspiration. Surface resistance
   values averaging 12 s m(-1) were derived from the eddy correlation
   estimates. Recent tidal flooding and rainfall were found to decrease
   surface resistance and increase E,IE, ratios. Estimates of
   evapotranspiration obtained using the Penman-Monteith method were shown
   to be sensitive to changes in surface resistance, canopy height and the
   method used to estimate net radiation from incoming solar radiation.
   These results underline the importance of accurately estimating such
   parameters based on site-specific data rather than relying on empirical
   equations, which are derived primarily for crops and forests. Copyright

Abstract = {{Soil erosion is a severe problem hindering sustainable agriculture on
   the Loess Plateau of China. Plot experiments were conducted under the
   natural rainfall condition during 1995-1997 at Wangdongguo and Aobao
   catchments in this region to evaluate the effects of various land use.
   cropping systems, land slopes and rainfall on runoff and sediment
   losses, as well as the differences in catchment responses. The
   experiments included various surface conditions ranging from bare soil
   to vegetated surfaces (maize, wheat residue, Robinia pseudoacacia L.,
   Amorpha fruticosa L., Stipa capillata L., buckwheat and Astragarus
   adsurgens L.). The measurements were tarried out on hill slopes with
   different gradients (i.e. 0 degrees to 36 degrees). These plots varied
   from 20 to 60 In in length. Results indicated that runoff and erosion in
   this region occurred mainly during summer storms. Summer runoff and
   sediment losses under cropping and other vegetation were significantly
   less than those from ploughed bare soil (i.e. without crop/plant or crop
   residue). There were fewer runoff and sediment losses with increasing
   canopy cover. Land slope had a major effect on runoff and sediment
   losses and this effect was markedly larger in the tillage plots than
   that in the natural grass and forest plots. although this effect was
   very small when the maximum rainfall intensity was larger than 58.8 mm/h
   or smaller than 2.4 mm/h. Sediment losses per unit area rose with
   increasing slope length for the same land slope and same land use. The
   effect of slope length on sediment losses was stronger on a bare soil
   plot than on a crop/plant plot. The runoff volume and sediment losses
   were both closely related to rainfall volume and maximum intensity,
   while runoff coefficient was mainly controlled by maximum rainfall
   intensity. Hortonian overland flow is the dominant runoff process in the
   region. The differences ill runoff volume, runoff coefficient and
   sediment losses between the catchments are mainly controlled by the
   maximum rainfall intensity and infiltration characteristics. The Aobao
   catchment yielded much larger runoff volume, runoff coefficient and
   sediment than the Wangdongguo catchment. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley

Abstract = {{The forested Coalburn catchment 1.5 km(2) in northern England
   experiences episodic stream acidification. In plan for sustainable
   management of the plantation forest cycle, an understanding is required
   of the flow pathways and hydrochemical routing signatures of the organic
   and mineral soils that make up the source areas for runoff. A tentative
   mixing model, based on simple water chemistry exists for the major
   (terrestrial) sources and buffers of acidification; it is being expanded
   and consolidated by a detailed approach to the organic components of
   runoff, via sampling and analysis of the luminescence of surface waters
   at the catchment outlet and in two distinctive feeder streams.
   Luminescence measurements are presented that permit a simple
   apportionment of source areas. However, the technique also appears to
   have potential for identifying differential flow sourcing between the
   acrotelm and catotelm of intact peat deposits and for clarifying the
   influence of forest root systems in altering the organic chemistry of
   infiltrating waters. Applications may include the monitoring and
   prediction of coloured water events for the water supply industry.

Abstract = {{There is considerable interest in large-scale spatial patterns of
   sediment transport in catchments, and this topic is often approached.
   using terrain-based modelling. In such models topography influences the
   discharge of overland now and its sediment transport capacity. The
   sediment transport capacity of overland flow is commonly expressed as a
   power function of slope and discharge (i.e, q(s) = k(1)q(beta)S(gamma)).
   The relationship between discharge and contributing area can also be
   expressed as a power function. Several reviews reveal a limited range of
   values for the two exponents beta and gamma. In this paper we examine
   the sensitivity of catchment-scale patterns of sediment delivery to
   valley Boors to a range of sediment transport capacity and hillslope
   hydrology parameterizations, using two catchments on the southern
   tablelands of New South Wales. The results indicate that, over the
   limited range of beta and gamma identified within the literature,
   sediment deliveries to valley floors across the two catchments al e
   similar for all but one of five sediment transport capacity
   relationships. The patterns are dominated by the trend in slope through
   each catchment. The sensitivity to hillslope hydrology of predicted
   sediment delivery patterns is strong in the catchment with systematic
   variation in unit hillslope area, and weak in the catchment for which
   there are no systematic trends in unit hillslope area. We believe there
   is less experimental evidence to restrict choice of hillslope hydrology
   parameters than there is for sediment transport capacity. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The parameters commonly considered to define climate are the mean annual
   precipitation and mean annual potential evapotranspiration. In this
   study an attempt ha been made to develop a relationship between average
   drought frequency and the evapotranspiration/precipitation ratio for the
   arid, semi-arid and subhumid climatic regions of India. The climatic
   regions are delineated using two climatic indices: namely (i) the ratio
   of mean annual precipitation (P-a) to global terrestrial mean annual
   precipitation (P-a), and (ii) the ratio of mean annual potential
   evapotranspiration (Ep) to mean annual precipitation (P-g). It was noted
   that the average drought frequency (i e., year(-1).) decreases gradually
   from dry to wet regions. The return period varies from 2 to 3 years in
   the arid regions (12 > E-p/P-a greater than or equal to 5), 3 to 5 years
   in semi-arid ret ions (5 > E-p/P-a greater than or equal to 2), and 5 to
   8 years in sub-humid regions (2 > E-p/P-a greater than or equal to 3/4).
   Another relationship was developed between the average frequency of
   drought occurrence and the ratio of mean annual deficit to mean annual
   precipitation, (E-p - P-a)/P-a. The results have been compared with the
   drought experiences documented for other regions of the world. Copyright

Abstract = {{A gamma distribution is one of the most frequently selected distribution
   types for hydrological frequency analysis. The bivariate gamma
   distribution with gamma marginals may be useful for analysing
   multivariate hydrological events. This study investigates the
   applicability of a bivariate gamma model with five parameters for
   describing the joint probability behavior of multivariate flood events.
   The parameters are proposed to be estimated from the marginal
   distributions by the method of moments. The joint distribution, the
   conditional distribution, and the associated return periods are derived
   from marginals. The usefulness of the model is demonstrated by
   representing the joint probabilistic behaviour between correlated flood
   peak and flood volume and between con elated flood volume and flood
   duration in the Madawask River basin in the province of Quebec, Canada.

Abstract = {{Dissolved oxygen mass balance has been computed for different reaches of
   River Kali in western Uttar Pradesh (India) to obtain the reaeration
   coefficient (K-2). A total of 270 field data sets have been collected
   during the period fi om March 1999 to February 2000. Eleven most popular
   predictive equations, used for reaeration prediction and utilizing mean
   stream velocity, bed slope, flow depth, friction velocity and Froude
   number, have been tested for their applicability in the River Kali using
   data generated during field survey. The K-2 values computed from these
   predictive equations have been compared with the K-2 values observed
   from dissolved oxygen balance measurements in the field. The performance
   of predictive equations have been evaluated using error estimation,
   namely standard error (SE), normal mean error (NME), mean multiplicative
   error (MME) and correlation statistics. The equations developed by Smoot
   and by Cadwallader and McDonnell showed comparatively better results.
   Moreover, a refined predictive equation has been developed using a
   least-squares algorithm for the River Kali that minimizes error
   estimates and improves correlation between observed and computed
   reaeration coefficients. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Transfer of atmospheric N deposition on shallow-soil forested basins on
   the Canadian Shield to receiving water bodies may be enhanced by rapid
   preferential dow along the soil-bedrock interface (BR runoff) on basin
   slopes. Controls on BR runoff, partitioning of event and pre-event water
   contributions to this how, and implications of this partitioning for N
   fluxes in BR runoff were studied under natural and artificial inputs to
   an instrumented slope. BR runoff as a fraction of water inputs to the
   slope increased with antecedent soil wetness and input depth. Event
   water contributions to BR runoff initially increased with antecedent
   soil wetness, but then declined at large antecedent soil wetness, Export
   of applied NH4+ from the slope was maximized when event water
   contributions containing large NH4+ concentrations dominated BR runoff;
   however, there was no relationship between the fraction of NO3-
   application transported in BR runoff and either application input or the
   event mater fraction of that runoff. The applicability of our results to
   other shallow-soil areas of the Canadian Shield is limited by artificial
   N inputs to the slope in excess of natural loads and by low rates of N
   mineralization and negligible nitrification in the slope's soils.
   Nevertheless, the study reinforces the need to consider how the
   hydrologic, geometric and pedologic properties of forest slopes interact
   with biotic and abiotic soil processes to control N transport and
   transformation. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetated filter strips (VFS) are designed to reduce sediment load and
   other pollutants into water bodies. However, adaptation of VFS in the
   field has been limited owing to lack of data about their efficiency and
   performance under natural field conditions. A number of models are
   available that simulate sediment transport and capping in VFS, but there
   is a general lack of confidence in VFS models owing to limited
   validation studies and model limitations that prevent correct
   application of these models under field conditions. The objective of
   this study is to test and validate a process-based model (VFSMOD) that
   simulates sediment trapping in VFS. This model links three submodels:
   modified Green-Ampt's infiltration, Quadratic overland flow submode]
   based on kinematic wave approximation and University of Kentucky
   sediment filtration model. A total of 20 VFS, 2, 5, 10 and 15 m long and
   with various vegetation covers, were tested under simulated sediment and
   runoff conditions. The results of these field experiments were used to
   validate the VFS model. The model requires 25 input parameters
   distributed over five input files. All input parameters were either
   measured or calculated using experimental data. The observed sediment
   trapping efficiencies varied from 65\% in the 2-m long VFS to 92\% in
   the 10-m long filters. No increase in sediment removal efficiency was
   observed at higher VFS length. Application of the VFS model to
   experimental data was satisfactory under the condition that actual Row
   widths are used in the model instead of the total filter width.
   Predicted and observed sediment trapping efficiencies and infiltration
   volume fitted very well, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of
   0.9 and 0.95, respectively. Regression analyses revealed that the slope
   and intercept of the regression lines between predicted versus observed
   infiltration volume and trapping efficiency were not significantly
   different than the line of perfect agreement with a slope of 1.0 and
   intercept of 0.0. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Human activity has resulted in increased nutrient levels in rivers and
   coastal seas all over Europe. Models that can describe nutrient fluxes
   from pollution sources to river outlets may help policy makers to select
   the most effective source control measures to achieve a reduction of
   nutrient levels in rivers and coastal seas. Part I of this paper
   describes the development of such a model: PolFlow. PolFlow was
   specially designed For operation at the river basin scale and is here
   applied to model 5-year average nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes in two
   European river basins (Rhine and Elbe) covering the period 1970-1995.
   Part II reports an error analysis and model evaluation, and compares
   PolFlow to simpler alternative models. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{In order to model complex environmental systems, one needs to find a
   balance between the model complexity and the quality of the data
   available needed to run and validate the model. This paper describes a
   method to find this balance. Four models of different complexity were
   applied to describe the transfer of nitrogen and phosphorus from
   pollution sources to rivet outlets in two large European river basins
   (Rhine and Elbe). A comparison of the predictive capability of these
   four models tells us something about the added value of the added model
   complexity. We also quantified the errors in the data that were used to
   run and validate the models and analysed to what extent the model
   validation errors could he attributed to data errors, and to what extent
   to shortcomings of the model. We conclude that although the addition of
   more process description is interesting from a theoretical point of
   view, it does not necessarily improve the predictive capability.
   Although our analysis is based on an extensive
   pollution-sources-river-load database it appeared that the information
   content of this database was sufficient only to support models of a
   limited complexity. Our analysis also illustrates that fur a proper
   justification of a model's degree of complexity one should compare the
   model to simplified versions of the model. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Residential areas in Kuwait City have witnessed a dramatic rise in
   subsurface water tables over the last three decades. This water rise
   phenomenon is attributed mainly to over irrigation practices of private
   gardens along with leakage from domestic and sewage networks. This paper
   presents a comprehensive study for urban drainage in two selected areas
   representing the two hydrogeological settings encountered in Kuwait
   City. In the first area, a vertical drainage scheme was applied
   successfully over an area of 1 km(2). The system has been under
   continuous operation and monitoring for more than 4 years Without
   problems, providing a permanent solution for the water rise problem in
   this area. The hydrogeological system has approached steady state
   conditions and the water levels have dropped to about 3.5 m below the
   ground surface. In the second area a dual drainage scheme, composing of
   horizontal and vertical elements, is proposed. Horizontal elements are
   suggested in the areas when the deep groundwater contains hazardous
   gases that may pose environmental problems. The proposed drainage scheme
   in the second area has not yet been implemented. Field tests were
   conducted to assess the aquifer parameters in both areas and a numerical
   model has been developed to predict the long-term response of the
   hydrogeological system in the two areas under consideration. Copyright

Abstract = {{Studies of glacier hydrology rely increasingly on measurements made in
   boreholes as a basis for reconstructing the character and behaviour of
   subglacial drainage systems. In temperate glaciers, in which boreholes
   remain open to the atmosphere following drilling, the interpretation of
   such data map be complicated by supraglacial or englacial water flows to
   and from boreholes.
   We report on a suite of techniques used to identify borehole water
   sources and to reconstruct patterns of water circulation within
   boreholes at Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland. Results are used to
   define a number of borehole `drainage' types. Examples of each drainage
   type are presented, along with the manner in which they influence
   interpretations of borehole water-levels, borehole water-quality data,
   and borehole dye Lr aces. The analysis indicates that a full
   understanding of possible borehole drainage modes is required for the
   correct interpretation of many borehole observations, and that those
   observations provide an accurate indication of subglacial conditions
   only under relatively restricted circumstances. Copyright (C) 2001 John

Abstract = {{Metallic content (Cr, Fe, Mn, Cu, Ni, Pb and Cd) of street sediments and
   street runoff in addition to major inorganic constituents (Ca, Mg, Na,
   K, HCO3, Cl, NO3 and SO4) of street runoff were determined under
   semi-arid conditions. Two sites in the vicinity of Amman during the
   pluvial year 1998-1999 were chosen for this investigation. A higher
   quantity of ionic contents was found at site 2 in comparison to site 1
   except for iron, which was significantly higher at site 1. This finding
   was attributed to higher anthropogenic activity and lower rainfall at
   site 2, which indicates better water quality of street runoff from
   residential sites than the city centre. The average concentrations of
   Pb, Cu and Cd in Amman street runoff compared with the highest levels
   recorded at humid sites of the world as a result the prevailing
   semi-arid conditions in the areas investigated. The highest
   concentrations of all constituents were detected during the first month
   of sampling, which might be the result of low rainfall, and a long dry
   period of atmospheric deposition preceding rainfall events. However,
   high levels of both lead and copper were recorded (below that of iron)
   which might be attributed to traffic pollution.
   In contrast, a significant variation between the average concentrations
   fur Cu, Ni and Cr was found in sediments from the two sites. Moreover, a
   significant difference was detected only for Cu and Mn at each site
   overtime.
   The overall pattern of the results suggests that all heavy metal
   concentrations for street runoff showed a significant variation over
   time at site 1 whereas only a significant variation was found for Ni at
   site 2, which can be explained as the result of higher rainfall at site
   1 than at site 2. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Predicting floodplain inundation: raster-based modelling versus the

Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{825-842}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{We compare two approaches to modelling floodplain inundation: a
   raster-based approach, which uses a relatively simple process
   representation, with channel flows being resolved separately from the
   floodplain using either a kinematic or diffusive wave approximation, and
   a finite-element hydraulic model aiming to solve the full
   two-dimensional shallow-water equations. A flood event on a short (c. 4
   km) reach of the upper River Thames in the UK is simulated, the models
   being validated against inundation extent as determined from satellite
   synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. The unconstrained friction
   parameters are found through a calibration procedure, where a measure of
   fit between predicted and observed shorelines is maximized. The raster
   and finite-element models offer similar levels of performance, both
   classifying approximately 84\% of the model domain correctly, compared
   with 65\% for a simple planar prediction of water surface elevation.
   Further discrimination between models is not possible given the errors
   in the validation data. The simple raster-based model is shown to have
   considerable advantages in terms of producing a straightforward
   calibration process, and being robust with respect to channel
   specification. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Situated at the foot of the Pichincha volcano, the city of Quito is
   frequently subjected to hydroclimatic hazards. In 1995 an 11.2 km(2)
   watershed, located in the vicinity of the city, was equipped with eight
   rain gauges and two Row gauges to better. understand the local
   rainfall/runoff transformation processes. Rainfall simulation
   experiments were carried out on more than 40 one-square-metre plots to
   measure infiltration point-processes. The high density of measurement
   devices allowed us to identify the origin and nature of the various
   contributions to runoff for the different physiographic units of the
   watershed: urban area from an altitude of 2800 to 3200 m; farmland,
   pasture and forested land, and finally paramo above 3900 m. Runoff
   occurs mainly in the lower part of the basin and is caused by
   urbanization; however, the natural soils of this area can also produce
   Hortonian runoff, which is predominant in a few events. This
   contribution can be studied through rainfall simulation experiments. In
   the upper natural zone. the younger and more permeable soils generate
   less runoff on the slopes. However, almost permanently saturated
   contributing areas, which are located in the bottom of the quebradas,
   may generate flood events, the size of which depends on the extent of
   the area concerned. Variations in the runoff coefficients are related
   first to the baseflow and second to the amount of rainfall in the
   previous 24 h. This analysis, which underlines the complexity of a
   small, peri-ulban, volcanic catchment, is a necessary preliminary to
   runoff modelling in an area where very few experiments have been carried
   out on small catchments. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{During 1998/1999, surface and subsurface sediment samples were collected
   along the entire length of the Spokane River from its outlet at the
   northern end of Lake Coeur d'Alene (CDA), Idaho, to Lake Roosevelt on
   the Columbia River, Washington. The study was conducted to determine if
   the trace element enrichments observed in Lake CDA acid on the
   floodplain and in the CDA River extend through the Spokane River Basin
   (SRB).
   As in Lake CDA, surface sediments in the SRB are enriched in Pb, Zn, As,
   Cd, Sb and Hg relative to local background levels. Pb, Cd and Zn are the
   most elevated, with maximum enrichment occurring in the upper Spokane
   River in close proximity to Lake CDA. On average, enrichment decreases
   downstream, apparently reflecting both increased distance from the
   inferred source (the CDA River Basin), as well as increased dilution by
   locally derived but unenriched materials. Only Cd and Zn display marked
   enrichment throughout the SRB. Pb, Zn and Cd seem to be associated
   mainly with an operationally defined iron oxide phase, whereas the
   majority of the As and Sb seem to be matrix-held.
   Subsurface sediments also are enriched in Pb, Zn, As, Cd, Sb and HE:
   relative to background levels. Based on Cs-137 and excess Pb-210 dating,
   trace clement enrichment began in the middle part of the SRB (Long Lake)
   between 1900 and 1920. This is contemporaneous with similar enrichments
   observed in Lake CDA, as well as the completion of Long Lake Dam (1913).
   In the most downstream part of the basin (Spokane River Arm of Lake
   Roosevelt), enrichment began substantially later, between 1930 and 1940.
   The temporal difference in enrichment between Long Lake and the River
   Arm may reflect the latter's greater distance from the presumed source
   of the enrichment (the CDA River Basin); however, the difference is more
   likely the result of the completion of Grand Coulee Dam (1934-1941),
   which formed Lake Roosevelt, backed up the Spokane River, and increased
   water levels in the River Arm by about 30 m.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the sensitivity of potential evapotranspiration
   to input meteorological variables, i.e. surface air temperature and
   surface vapor pressure. The sensitivity studies have been carried out
   for a wide range of land surface variables such as wind speed, leaf area
   index and surface temperatures, Errors in the surface air temperature
   and surface vapor pressure result in errors of different signs in the
   computed potential evapotranspiration. This result has implications for
   use of estimated values from satellite data or analysis of surface air
   temperature and surface vapor pressure in large-scale hydrological
   modeling. The comparison of cumulative potential evapotranspiration
   estimates using ground observations and satellite observations over
   Manhattan, Kansas for a period of several months shows a variable
   difference between the two estimates, The use of satellite estimates of
   surface skin temperature in hydrological modeling to update the soil
   moisture using a physical adjustment concept is studied in detail,
   including the extent of changes in soil moisture resulting from the
   assimilation of surface skin temperature. The soil moisture of the 1 cm
   surface layer was adjusted by 0.09 mm over a 10-day period as a result
   of a 3 K difference between the predicted and the observed surface
   temperature. This is a considerable amount given the fact that the top
   layer can hold only 5 mm of moisture. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Upland forested catchments in the Appalachian Plateau region receive
   among the greatest rates of atmospheric sulphur (S) deposition in the
   eastern USA, although coal mines and S-bearing minerals in bedrock may
   also contribute to stream acidity in this region. Watershed mass balance
   and stable S isotopic values (delta (34)S) of sulphate (SO(4)(2-)) were
   used to assess the contributions to stream SO(4)(2-) from atmospheric
   and lithogenic sources at Yellow Creek (YC), a headwater catchment on
   the Appalachian Plateau in West Virginia. Oxygen isotopic values (delta
   (18)O) Of water were used to study catchment hydrology. Stream output of
   SO(4)(2-) was c. 60\% of atmospheric S deposition during a relatively
   dry year, whereas atmospheric S input was nearly balanced by stream
   output during a year with above normal amounts of precipitation. The
   temporal patterns and values of delta (34)S were similar between bulk
   precipitation and stream water at two upper elevation sites. At the
   lowest elevation site, stream delta (34)S values were similar to bull;
   precipitation values during the dormant season but were slightly lower
   than precipitation during the low-flow summer, probably as the result of
   a greater proportion of stream water being derived from deep
   hydrological flowpaths that have contacted S-bearing minerals with low
   delta (34)S values in coal seams. Stream delta (34)S values at YC were
   significantly higher than at Coal Run, a catchment containing abandoned
   coal prospects and having a greater amount of S-bearing minerals than
   YC. Results suggested that lithogenic S is a relatively minor source
   acid that atmospheric deposition is the principal source of stream
   SO(4)(2-), and thus stream acidity, at YC. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley

   in the south-east of Spain, were selected and monitored for 3 years
   (1991-93) in order to provide information on the hydrological and
   erosional response. A pluviogram and hydrograph recorded data at 1-min
   intervals during each storm, after which the soil loss was collected and
   the particle size of the sediment was analysed. Runoff coefficients of
   about 9\% and soil losses of between 84.83 and 298.9 g m(-2) year(-1)
   were observed in the area. Rapid response times (geometric mean values
   lower than 2 h) and low runoff thresholds (mean values between 3.5 to
   5.9 mm) were the norm in the experimental areas. A rain intensity of
   over 15 mm h(-1) was considered as `erosive rainfall' in these areas
   because of the total soil loss and the transport capacity of the
   overland flow. Differences in pore-size distribution explained the
   different hydrological responses observed between areas. The erosional
   response was more complex and basically seemed to be determined by soil
   aggregate stability and topographical properties. A greater proportion
   of finer particles in the eroded material than in the soil matrix
   indicated selective erosion and the transport of finer material.

Abstract = {{Groundwater in coastal areas is commonly disturbed by tidal
   fluctuations. A two-dimensional analytical solution is derived to
   describe the groundwater fluctuation in a leaky confined aquifer system
   near open tidal water under the assumption that the groundwater head in
   the confined aquifer fluctuates in response to st:a tide whereas that of
   the overlying unconfined aquifer remains constant. The analytical
   solution presented here is an extension of the solution by Sun for
   two-dimensional groundwater flow in a confined aquifer and the solution
   by Jiao and Tang for one-dimensional groundwater flow in a leaky
   confined aquifer. The analytical solution is compared with a
   two-dimensional finite difference solution. On the basis of the
   analytical solution, the groundwater head distribution in a leaky
   confined aquifer in response to tidal boundaries is examined and the
   influence of leakage on groundwater fluctuation is discussed. Copyright

Abstract = {{In the present study an attempt has been made to calculate the mass
   transfers of suspended particulate matter and associated heavy metal
   within the lower portion of the Paraiba do Sul River drainage basin and
   the contribution of its tributaries. The highest metal loads were
   related with the highest water flows and, consequently, with the highest
   suspended particulate matter loads, which increased both by surface
   runoff and sediment resuspension. The highest flow month for the total
   transported load contributed between 34 and 66\% of the total metal
   transported per year. Tnt total load transported during the entire rainy
   season ranges from 82 to 93\% of the total transported load. The
   importance of the tributary input for the total transported load of the
   Paraiba do Sul River was generally lower than 10\%, although in some
   months, when the Paraiba do Sul River had low water discharge and
   storage local rain occurred, this increased upto 40\%. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{A hybrid model for point rainfall has been explored to model the diurnal
   cycles in rainfall properties. The hybrid model is a product of two
   random processes: an occurrence process and an intensity process. Two
   occurrence process models, first-order Markov chain and periodic
   discrete autoregressive, were compared initially. Fourier series was
   fitted to the properties of the occurrence and intensity processes of
   the observed data in order to reduce the number of model parameters. The
   Bayesian and Akaike information criteria were used to identify the
   optimum number of harmonics of the Fourier series. Simulation results of
   the two hybrid models were similar, if not identical, and compared well
   with the observed. in the average sense, the introduction of diurnal
   cycles in the model parameters did not improve the reproduction of the
   observed aggregation properties of the occurrence process. However, the:
   diurnal distributions of the aggregation statistics were significantly
   improved by increasing the order of the Markov chain model. Also the
   information criteria tend to favour higher than first-order Markov chain
   models. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Complete daily water budget information was assembled for a 105 km
   segment. of the South Platte River in the plains region below Denver,
   CO, for the period 1983-1993. The data were used in testing the
   possibility that dependence of alluvial exchange mechanisms on stage
   height, as shown by models of alluvial exchange, allows alluvial
   exchange to be predicted continuously over a given reach through use of
   statistical information on river discharge. The study segment was
   divided into an upper and a lower reach; daily alluvial exchanges for
   each reach were estimated by the method of residuals. The two reaches
   show small (15\%) but statistically significant annual differences in
   rates of exchange. For each reach, there is a seasonal pattern (2
   .5-fold oscillation) in alluvial discharge to the channel, reflecting
   seasonality in recharge of the alluvium by irrigation. At discharges up
   to 40 m(3)/s (82nd percentile), alluvial discharge to the channel occurs
   at a rate independent of river discharge. Above 40 m(3)/s, net alluvial
   discharge into the channel is progressively reduced; at 60 m(3)/s (92nd
   percentile) there is no net alluvial exchange. At still higher river
   discharges, water is lost to the alluvium through bank storage at a rate
   that is linearly related to the logarithm of discharge. Annually,
   alluvial discharge accounts for 15-18\% of water entering the study
   segment, and alluvial recharge through bank storage accounts for 2-48 of
   water leaving the segment. Alluvial recharge through bank storage at the
   highest discharges can, however, exceed low-flow alluvial discharge
   rates by five-fold over short intervals. Even though daily alluvial
   exchanges vary widely, they can be estimated at r(2) values above 80\%
   on the basis of reach, season, and river discharge. Copyright (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Measurements of evapotranspiration from contrasting stands of Phragmites
   australis {[}ET(Reed)] were obtained over several years at three sites
   within England between 1994 and 1998, A comparison with published
   ET(Reed) values showed the UK rates to be considerably lower than those
   measured in continental Europe. From the ET(Reed) data monthly crop
   coefficients {[}K-c(Reed)] have been developed, which when used with
   Reference Crop Evapotranspiration will enable reedbed water use to be
   determined. Due to the differences in study site characteristics, values
   for K-c varied widely, and it was not considered appropriate to combine
   results to produce a single set of monthly mean values. However,
   suggestions are made regarding the application of the K-c(Reed) values
   to wetland design. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   saline, sodic or alkaline soils, and it produces modifies the chemical
   composition of rivers in Somontano.
   Irrigation has increased the volume of filtered water, especially in the

Abstract = {{Rain-gauge catch efficiencies are affected by wind. Wind makes raindrops
   fall at an angle of inclination and the effective diameter of the rain
   gauge orifice smaller than if raindrops fall into the gauge vertically.
   Two spherical and two semi-spherical orifices were designed to modify
   standard gauges and others in use today. The two spherical orifices
   catch rain with an effective diameter always equal to the actual
   diameter regardless of wind speed and direction. The semi-spherical
   orifices, used side-by-side with a standard gauge, correct 50\% of catch
   deficiencies made by the standard gauge. Tests based on 115 storms show
   that the four new gauges caught more rainfall than the standard gauge,
   with an average catch increase ranging from 8\% to 16\%. Compared with
   the pit gauge, average deficiency in catch ranged from -1\% (spherical
   rain gauge orifice with cylinders) to 4\%, whereas the deficiency for
   the standard gauge was -10\%. Percentage deficiencies of the new gauges
   were positively affected by wind speed, raindrop inclination and
   rainfall intensity. Although the new gauges tended to underestimate the
   standard gauge in small storms (< 0.25 cm) and overestimated the pit
   gauge under strong winds, their deviations are small. Underestimates for
   small storms could be improved by using gauge materials that reduce
   surface temperature, evaporation and water retention. The gauges are
   simple in design, easy to operate and inexpensive. In order to maintain
   a historically consistent set of rainfall data, a dual-gauge (standard
   gauge + spherical gauge) is recommended for existing rainfall stations.
   The new rain gauge orifices are suitable for large-scale applications.

Abstract = {{The variation of seawater level resulting from tidal fluctuations is
   usually neglected in regional groundwater flow studies. Although the
   tidal oscillation is damped near the shoreline, there is a
   quasi-steady-slate rise in the mean water-table position, which may have
   an influence on regional groundwater flow. In this paper the effects of
   tidal fluctuations on groundwater hydraulics are investigated using a
   variably saturated numerical model that includes the effects of a
   realistic mild beach slope, seepage face and the unsaturated zone. In
   particular the impact of these factors on the velocity field in the
   aquifer is assessed. Simulations show that the tidal fluctuation has
   substantial consequences for the local velocity field in the vicinity of
   the exit face, which affects the nearshore migration of contaminant in
   coastal aquifers. An overheight in the water table as a result of the
   tidal fluctuation is observed anti this has a significant effect on
   groundwater discharge to the sea when the landward boundary condition is
   a constant water level. The effect of beach slope is very significant
   and simplifying the problem by considering a vertical beach face causes
   serious errors in predicting the water-table position and the
   groundwater flux. For media with a high effective capillary fringe, the
   moisture retained above the water table is important in determining the
   effects of the tidal fluctuations. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Since its development by Lighthill and Whitham (1955a,b), the kinematic
   wave theory has found widespread application in environmental and water
   sciences, It took nearly 15 years before the theory was accepted as a
   sound scientific concept for modelling of a variety of hydrological
   processes. The debate as to its validity, however, still continues in
   some quarters and is not likely to end any time soon. Irrespective of
   the merits of the argument for or against the theory, new areas of its
   application continue to unfold and its scope is expanding considerably.
   These days the kinematic wave theory is being applied to a variety of
   hydrological processes (Singh, 1996a, 1997a,b). Examples of its
   application span overland and channel flow, baseflow, unsaturated flow,
   macropore flow, flow in furrows and borders, river hydraulics, movement
   of glaciers, erosion and sediment transport, sedimentation, solute
   transport, microbial. transport and chromatographic transport, to name
   but a few. These and other applications of the kinematic wave theory can
   be pooled together under different branches of hydrology, including
   surface water hydrology, vadose zone hydrology, river and coastal
   hydrology, irrigation hydrology, subsurface hydrology, snow and glacier
   hydrology, and water quality hydlology. The discussion in what follows
   is organized according to these areas of application.
   The objective of this paper is to trace the history of evolution of the
   kinematic wave theory and its application in hydrology and water
   resources. This historical essay attempts to put the theory in I,roper
   perspective and should serve as a guide to decide when and where to use
   the theory. The essay points to areas where further advances in applying
   the theory can be made.}},

Abstract = {{The event- and physics-based KINEROS2 runoff/erosion model for
   predicting overland flow generation and sediment production was applied
   to unpaved mountain roads. Field rainfall simulations conducted in
   northern Thailand provided independent data for model calibration and
   validation. Validation shows that KINEROS2 can be parameterized to
   simulate total discharge, sediment transport and sediment concentration
   on small-scale road plots, for a range of slopes, during simulated
   rainfall events. The KINEROS2 model, however, did not accurately predict
   time-dependent changes in sediment output and concentration. In
   particular, early flush peaks and the temporal decay in sediment output
   were not predicted, owing to the inability of KINEROS2 to model removal
   of a surface sediment layer of finite depth. After 15-20 min, sediment
   transport declines as the supply of loose superficial material becomes
   depleted. Modelled erosion response was improved by allowing road
   erodibility to vary during an event. Changing the model values of
   erosion detachment parameters in response to changes in surface sediment
   availability improved model accuracy of predicted sediment transport by
   30-40\%. A predictive relationship between road erodibility `states' and
   road surface sediment depth is presented. This relationship allows
   implementation of the dynamic erodibility (DE) method to events where
   pre-storm sediment depth can be estimated (e.g., from traffic usage
   variables). Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal and spatial rainfall patterns were analysed to describe the
   distribution of daily rainfall across a medium-sized (379 km(2))
   tropical catchment. Investigations were carried out to assess whether a
   climatological variogram model was appropriate for mapping rainfall
   taking into consideration the changing rainfall characteristics through
   the wet season. Exploratory, frequency and moving average analyses of 30
   years' daily precipitation data were used to describe the reliability
   and structure of the rainfall regime. Four phases in the wet season were
   distinguished, with the peak period (mid-August to mid-September)
   representing the wettest period. A low-cost rain gauge network of 36
   plastic gauges with overflow reservoirs was installed and monitored to
   obtain spatially distributed rainfall data. Geostatistical techniques
   were used to develop global and wet season phase climatological
   variograms. The unscaled climatological variograms were cross-validated
   and compared using a range of rainfall events. Ordinary Kriging was
   performed better, used as the interpolation method. The global
   climatological variogram gamma{*} = 1.2 {[}1 - exp - h/18 km] performed
   better, and was used to optimize the number and location of rain gauges
   in the network. The research showed that although distinct wet season
   phases could be established based on the temporal analysis of daily
   rainfall characteristics, the interpolation of daily rainfall across a
   medium-sized catchment based on spatial analysis was better served by
   using the global rather than the wet season phase climatological
   variogram model. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Hans A. Einstein initiated a probabilistic approach to modelling
   sediment transport in rivers. His formulae were based on theory and were
   stimulated by laboratory investigations. The theory assumes that bed
   load movement occurs in individual steps of rolling, sliding or
   saltation and rest periods. So far very few attempts have been made to
   measure stochastic elements in nature. For the first time this paper
   presents results of radio-tracing the travel path of individual
   particles in a large braided gravel bed river: the Waimakariri River of
   New Zealand. As proposed by Einstein, it was found that rest periods can
   be modelled by an exponential distribution, but particle step lengths
   are better represented by a gamma distribution. Einstein assumed an
   average travel distance of 100 grain-diameters for any bed load particle
   between consecutive points of deposition, but larger values of 6.7 m or
   150 grain-diameters and 6.1 m or 120 grain-diameters were measured for
   two test particle sizes. Together with other available large scale field
   data, a dependence of the mean step length on particle diameter relative
   to the D-50 Of the bed surface was found. During small floods the time
   used for movement represents only 2.7\% of the total time from erosion
   to deposition. The increase in percentage of time being used for
   transport means that it then has to be regarded in stochastic transport
   models. Tracing the flow path of bed load particles between erosion and
   deposition sites is a step towards explaining the interactions between
   sediment transport and river morphology. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Two adjacent subcatchments on soils with very strong texture contrast
   between the A soil horizons (sandy loam texture) and B soil horizons
   (clay texture) in the Adelaide Hills, South Australia were instrumented
   to collect overland and subsurface flow from dairy pasture.
   Subcatchments were defined by exclusion drains in the upper reaches and
   stainless steel barriers at the lower boundary. Water samples were
   analysed for 20 different chemical fractions. Chemical loads were
   examined in order to determine relationships among simple empirical
   event and site characteristics, and between chemical fractions. All but
   five of the chemical fractions could be separated into one of two clear
   groups using a statistical technique based on the magnitude of simple
   correlation coefficients. The two groups consisted of either dissolved
   or particulate fractions. The clear separation into these groups is
   consistent with the majority of chemical fractions moving from pasture
   by one of only two processes. Simple empirical variables in a multiple
   regression explained a high proportion of variation in chemical loads in
   runoff water. These findings may have major implications in the
   modelling and prediction of chemical loads in runoff from agricultural
   catchments and the setting of environmental limits, in simplifying
   chemical loss predictions by adding a nutrient loss module to runoff
   volume predictions. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The summer discharge pattern of the Skeldal River, which drains a 560
   km(2) partly glacierized catchment in northeast Greenland, is dominated
   by diurnal oscillations reflecting variations in the melt rate of snow
   and ice in the basin. Superimposed on this diurnal pattern are numerous
   short-lived discharge fluctuations of irregular periodicity and
   magnitude. The larger fluctuations are described and attributed to both
   rainfall events and periodic collapse of the glacier margin damming flow
   from beneath the Skelbrae glacier. Other minor fluctuations are less
   readily explained but are associated with changes in the channelized and
   distributed reservoirs and possibly temporary blockage of subglacial
   conduits caused by ice melt with subsequent damming.
   Fluctuations in suspended sediment concentration (SSC) are normally
   associated with discharge fluctuations, although examples of `transient
   flushes' were observed where marked increases in SSC occurred in the
   absence of corresponding discharge variations. A strong relationship
   between the event discharge increase and event SSC increase for
   rainfall-induced events was established, but no such relationship
   existed for non-rainfall-induced events. There is some evidence for an
   exhaustion effect in the SSC patterns both at the event time-scale and
   as the month proceeds. A mean suspended sediment load of 1765 +/- 0.26 t
   day(-1) was estimated for the study period, which would be equivalent to
   a suspended sediment yield of 732 +/- 4 t km(-2) year(-1). Copyright (C)

   a warm monomictic lake {[}i.e. in a year, the lake is stratified during
   the summer months (March/April to October/November) and well mixed
   during the remaining months]. The presence of a centrally submerged
   ridge inhibits the mixing of deeper waters of the lake's two sub-basins,
   and they exhibit differential behaviour. The rates of change of isotopic
   composition of hypolimnion and epilimnion waters of the lake indicate
   that the water retention time of the lake is very short, and the two
   have independent inflow components. A few groundwater inflow points to
   the lake are inferred along the existing fractures, fault planes and
   dykes. In addition to poor vertical mixing of the lake due to the
   temperature-induced seasonal stratification, the lake also shows poor
   horizontal mixing at certain locations of the lake. The lake-groundwater
   system appears to be a flow-through type.
   Also, a tritium and water-balance model was developed to estimate the
   water retention time of well-mixed and hydrologically steady state
   lakes. The model assumes a piston flow of groundwater contributing to
   the lake. The developed model was verified for (a) Finger Lakes, New
   York; (b) Lake Neusiedlersee, Austria; and (c) Blue Lake, Australia
   based on literature data. The predicted water retention times of the
   lakes were close to those reported or calculated from the hydrological
   parameters given in the references. On application of this model to Lake
   Naini, a water retention time of similar to2 years and age of
   groundwater contributing to the lake similar to 14 years is obtained.

Abstract = {{In glacierized catchments, meteorological inputs driving surface melting
   are translated into runoff outputs mediated by the glacier hydrological
   system: analysis of the relationship between meteorology and diurnal and
   seasonal patterns of runoff should reflect the functioning of that
   system, with the role of meltwater storage likely to be of particular
   importance. Daily meltwater storage is determined for a glacier at 78
   degreesN in the Svalbard archipelago, by comparing inputs calculated
   from a surface energy balance model with measured outputs (proglacial
   discharge). Solar radiation, air temperature, wind speed and proglacial
   discharge are then analysed by regression and time-series methods, in
   order to assess the meteorology-discharge relationship and its variation
   at diurnal and seasonal time-scales. The recorded discharge time-series
   can be divided into two contrasting intervals: up to early August,
   proglacial discharge was high and variable, mean hydrographs showed
   little indication of diurnal cycling, ARIMA models of discharge
   indicated a non-seasonal, moving-average generating process, and there
   was a net loss of meltwater from storage; from early August, proglacial
   discharge was low and relatively invariable, but with clearer diurnal
   cycles, regression models of discharge showed substantially improved
   correlations with air temperature and solar radiation, ARIMA models
   indicated a non-seasonal, autoregressive generating process, and
   eventually a seasonal component, and there was a net gain in meltwater
   storage. The transition between the two periods is brief compared with
   the duration of the melt season. The runoff response to meteorology
   therefore lacks the strongly progressive element previously identified
   in mid-latitude glacierized catchments. In particular, the glacier
   hydrological system only appears responsive to diurnal forcing following
   the depletion of the seasonal snowpack meltwater store. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Scaling aspects of river flow routing are studied by comparing two flow
   routing schemes, one designed for use in coupled general circulation
   models (GCMs) and operated at large spatial scales (similar to 350 km),
   and the other designed for use in typical hydrological applications at
   small spatial scales (similar to 25 km). The same runoff data are used
   as input into the two routing schemes, and comparisons are made between
   mean annual, mean monthly and daily streamflow simulated at four
   locations within the Mackenzie River Basin. The results suggest that for
   the purpose of realistically modelling monthly streamflow at the mouth
   of the rivers in GCMs, flow routing at large spatial scales gives
   similar results. However, the amplitude of the annual streamflow cycle
   is slightly but characteristically larger, when routing is performed at
   large spatial scales. Flow routing at large spatial scales also results
   in overestimation of high flows, while low flows are underestimated.

Abstract = {{In this study, we attempted to analyse a drawdown pattern around a
   pumping well in an unconfined sandy gravelly aquifer constructed in a
   laboratory tank by means of both experimental and numerical modelling of
   groundwater flow. The physical model consisted of recharge, aquifer and
   discharge zones. Permeability and specific yield of the aquifer material
   were determined by Dupuit approximation under steady-state flow and
   stepwise gravitational drainage of groundwater, respectively. The
   drawdown of water table in pumping and neighbouring observation wells
   was monitored to investigate the effect of no-flow boundary on the
   drawdown pattern during pumping for three different boundary conditions:
   (i) no recharge and no discharge with four no-flow boundaries (Case 1);
   (ii) no recharge and reservoir with three no-flow boundaries (Case 2);
   (iii) recharge and discharge with two no-flow boundaries (Case 3). Based
   on the aquifer parameters, numerical modelling was also performed to
   compare the simulated drawdown with that observed. Results showed that a
   large difference existed between the simulated drawdown and that
   observed in wells for all cases. The reason for the difference could be
   explained by the formation of a curvilinear type water table between
   wells rather than a linear one due to a delayed response of water table
   in the capillary fringe. This phenomenon was also investigated from a
   mass balance study on the pumping volume. The curvilinear type of water
   table was further evidenced by measurement of water contents at several
   positions in the aquifer between wells using time domain reflectometry
   (TDR). This indicates that the existing groundwater flow model
   applicable to an unconfined aquifer lacks the capacity to describe a
   slow response of water table in the aquifer and care should be taken in
   the interpretation of water table formation in the aquifer during
   pumping. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing was used to understand the seasonal and spatial variation
   of suspended sediment in the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers in Bangladesh
   for two different discharge periods. Suspended sediment concentration
   (SSC) in these rivers was estimated from the reflectance of Landsat TM
   band 3. During the high discharge period, SSC in the Ganges is higher
   than that in the Brahmaputra. But in the low discharge period, this is
   reversed. Both erosional and depositional processes are active on
   their:flood plains. Significant fluctuations in SSC and in suspended
   sediment load were observed along their courses because of river bank
   erosion and deposition and/or scouring and aggradation of river beds.
   Owing to scouring and turbulence, SSC increases markedly at the
   confluence of these rivers. Reflectance of AVHRR band 1 data was also
   analysed to study the distribution of suspended sediment along other
   reaches of these rivers. Like SSC, reflectance at the confluence zone
   increases compared with that in the Brahmaputra. However, this increase
   is not marked compared with the Ganges. The influence of their
   tributaries on the suspended sediment load could be inferred from the
   pattern of reflectance. Remote sensing data used in this study was
   corrected for atmospheric effects. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Soil cores from river marginal wetlands from the Torridge and Severn
   catchments in the UK were collected to study rates of soil
   denitrification at different sites and at two stations (levee and
   backplain depression) at the river margin. Half the cores were
   sterilized prior to flooding to destroy the denitrifying bacteria. After
   flooding and equilibration, monitoring the concentration of amended
   nitrate in the supernatant of the sterile cores over a period of 7 days
   provided a simple procedure for the estimation of the diffusion
   coefficient of the nitrate ion in the flooded soils. An expression was
   developed that permitted this diffusion coefficient to be extracted from
   the slope of a plot of supernatant concentration versus (time)(1/2). The
   values obtained, at 15 degreesC, varied from 2.4 to 6.8 x 10(-10) m(2)
   s(-1). Sterile cores are usually treated as controls in denitrification
   experiments; this work develops a procedure whereby they may yield
   useful soil process information. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The importance and interaction of various hydrological pathways and
   identification of runoff source areas involved in solute transport are
   still under considerable debate in catchment hydrology. To reveal
   stormflow generating areas and flow paths, hydrometric behaviour of
   throughfall, soil water from various depths, runoff, and respective
   concentrations of the environmental tracers O-18, Si, K, SO4 and
   dissolved organic carbon were monitored for a 14-week period in a steep
   headwater catchment in the Black Forest Mountains. Germany.
   Two stormflow hydrographs were selected and, based on O-18 and Si,
   chemically separated into three flow components. Their sources were
   defined using mixing diagrams. Additional information about stormflow
   generating mechanisms was derived from recession analyses of the basin's
   complete 5-year hydrograph record. By providing insight into storage
   properties and residence times of outflowing reservoirs of the basin,
   recession analysis proved to be a valuable tool in runoff model
   conceptualization. Its results agreed well with hydrometric and
   hydrochemical data. Supported by evaluation of 30 hillslope soil
   profiles a coherent: concept of stormflow generation could be derived:
   whereas in many steeply sloped basins in the temperate region soil water
   from hillslopes appears to have an immediate effect on the shape of the
   stormflow hydrograph, its role at this basin is basically restricted to
   the recharge of the groundwater reservoir in the near-channel area.
   Storm hydrograph peaks appear to be derived from a small direct runoff
   component supplemented by a fast delivery of baseflow from the
   groundwater reservoir in the valley bottom. Copyright (C) 2001 John

Abstract = {{The near-stream zone has received increasing attention owing to its
   influence on stream water chemistry in general and acidity in
   particular. Possible processes in this zone include cation exchange,
   leaching of organic matter and redox reactions of sulphur compounds. III
   this study the influences of processes in the near-stream zone on the
   acidity in runoff from a small, acidified catchment in central southern
   Sweden were investigated. The study included sampling of groundwater,
   soil water and stream water along with hydrological measurements. An
   input-output budget for the catchment was established based on data from
   the International Go-operative Programme on Integrated Monitoring at
   this site.
   The catchment was heavily acidified by deposition of anthropogenic
   sulphur, with pH in stream water between 4.4 and 4.6. There was also no
   relationship between stream flow and pH, which is indicative of chronic
   acidification. Indications of microbial reduction of sulphate were found
   in some places near the stream, but the near-stream zone did not have a
   general impact on the sulphate concentration in discharging groundwater.
   The near-stream zone was a source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in
   the stream, which had a median DOC of 6.8 mg L-1. The influence on
   stream acidity from organic anions was overshadowed by the effect of
   sulphate, however, except during a spring flow episode, when additional
   organic matter was flushed out and the sulphate-rich ground water was
   mixed with more diluted event water. Ion exchange was not an important
   process in the near-stream zone of the Kindla catchment. Different
   functions of the near-stream zone relating to discharge acidity are
   reported in the literature. In this study there was even a variation
   within the site. There is therefore a need for more case studies to
   provide a more detailed understanding of the net effects that the
   near-stream zone can have on stream chemistry under different
   circumstances. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study combines neural networks and fuzzy arithmetic to present a
   counterpropagation fuzzy-neural network (CFNN) for streamflow
   reconstruction. The CFNN has a rule-based control, a modified

   training data to improve the accuracy or streamflow reconstruction. The
   CFNN establishes the input and output relationship of a watershed
   without set-up parameters. The parameters are estimated systematically
   by the approach converging to an optimal solution. One sequence of data
   generated by the Monte Carlo method is used to demonstrate the accuracy
   of the CFNN. The streamflow data of the Da-chia River, in central
   Taiwan, is also used to evaluate the performances of the CFNN. The
   results indicate the reliability and accuracy of the CFNN for streamflow

Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Harvested sites rarely return to functional ecosystems after abandonment
   because drainage and peat extraction lower the water table and expose
   relatively decomposed peat, which is hydrologically unsuitable for
   Sphagnum moss reestablishment. Some natural regeneration of Sphagnum has
   occurred in isolated pockets on traditionally harvested (block-cut)
   sites, for reasons that are poorly understood, but are related to
   natural functions that regulate runoff and evaporation. This study
   evaluates the water balance of a naturally regenerated cutover bog and
   compares it with a nearby natural bog of similar size and origin, near
   Riviere du Loup, Quebec. Water balance results indicated that
   evapotranspiration was the major water loss from the harvested bog,
   comprising 92 and 84\% of total outputs (2.9 mm day(-1)) during the 1997
   and 1998 seasons, respectively. Despite denser tree cover at the
   harvested site, evapotranspiration from the natural bog was similar,
   although less spatially variable. At the harvested site, evaporative
   losses ranged from 1.9 mm day(-1) on raised baulks and roads to 3.6 mm
   day(-1) from moist surfaces with Sphagnum. Although about half of the
   ditches were:inactive or operating at only a fraction of their original
   efficiency, runoff was still significant at 12 and 24\% of precipitation
   during the 1997 and 1998 study seasons, respectively. This compares with
   negligible rates of runoff at the natural bog. Thus the cutover bog,
   although abandoned over 25 years ago, has not regained its hydrological
   function. This is both a cause and effect of its inability to support
   renewed Sphagnum regeneration. Without suitable management (e.g.
   blocking ditches), this site is not likely to improve for a very long
   time. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive water sampling in conjunction with hydrological observations
   was conducted during three different rainstorms in order to understand
   the effects of rainfall events on the temporal variation of streamwater
   chemistry in a small headwater forest catchment. Concentrations of Na+
   and SO42- decreased as the discharge rate increased. Hydrograph
   separation of the components was made using the three-component model
   based on the end-members mixing analysis (EMMA). The three end-members
   were:
   1. the groundwater in the saturated zone that prescribes the chemistry
   of the baseflow;
   2. the throughfall that dilutes the streamwater;
   3. the groundwater in the transient saturated zone prescribed, which was
   dependent on the groundwater level.
   When the groundwater level was lower, only the two components,
   groundwater in the saturated zone and throughfall, affected the
   streamwater chemistry. When the groundwater level rose and the saturated
   zone spread, the groundwater in the transient saturated zone became the
   third component. When the groundwater in the transient saturated zone
   contributed to the discharge, this component became the dominant source
   and the streamwater chemistry was affected by the groundwater chemistry
   in the transient saturated zone. When this component was discharged as
   the saturation overland flow, the streamwater chemistry was greatly
   affected by this component. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The internal riverine processes acting upon phosphorus and dissolved
   silicon were investigated along a 55 km stretch of the River Swale
   during four monitoring campaigns. Samples of river water were taken at 3
   h intervals at sites on the main river and the three major tributaries.
   Samples were analysed for soluble reactive phosphorus, total dissolved
   phosphorus, total phosphorus, dissolved silicon and suspended solid
   concentration. Mass-balances for each determinand were calculated by
   comparing the total load entering the river with the total load measured
   at the downstream site. The difference, i.e. the residual load, showed
   that there was a large retention of phosphorus and silicon within the
   system during the March 1998 flood event, but the other three campaigns
   produced net-exports.
   Cumulative residual loads were calculated for each determinand at 6 h
   intervals throughout each campaign. This incremental approach showed
   that the mass-balance residuals followed relatively consistent patterns
   under various river discharges. During stable low-flow, there was a
   retention of particulate phosphorus within the system and also a
   retention of total dissolved phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus,
   most likely caused by the sorption of soluble phosphorus by
   bed-sediments. In times of high river-discharge, there was a
   mobilization and export of stored bed-sediment phosphorus. During
   overbank flooding, there was a large retention (58\% of total input) of
   particulate phosphorus within the system, due to the mass deposition of
   phosphorus-rich sediment onto the floodplain. Soluble phosphorus was
   also retained within the system by sequestration from the water column
   by the high concentration of suspended solids.
   The dissolved silicon mass-balance residuals had a less consistent
   pattern in relation to river discharge. There was a large retention of
   dissolved silicon during overbank flooding, possibly due to sorption
   onto floodplain soil, and net-exports during periods of both stable low
   how and rising limbs of hydrographs, due to release of dissolved silicon
   from pore-waters. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The advantage of an irrigation system is that experiments of varying
   precipitation duration and intensity can be performed in a controlled
   situation. An effective portable irrigation system is described for use
   in experimental plot hillslope and wetland runoff studies. The system
   consists of four parts: (1) a water pump; (2) a tracer reservoir; (3) a
   chemical feed pump; and (4) distribution hoses. Relatively uniform water
   application is achieved by a series of manual valves controlling water
   flow fi om the main carrier hose to the distribution hoses. The
   irrigation system materials are inexpensive and installation and
   operation costs are minor. The system was used to study runoff
   generation from a small-saturated area in a spring-fed swamp Ear a range
   of precipitation intensities and durations. The irrigation system
   applied a maximum intensity of 14.0 mm h(-1), for a maximum duration of
   180 min, to a 190 m(2) area. This range of application incorporated all
   storms up to a one in three year event. The variance of the tracer load
   was almost three times greater for natural (60\%) than with the
   irrigation system (22\%). The irrigation system reduced the uncertainty
   in the pre-event water fraction (using a two-component hydrograph
   separation) from 3.4\% in natural events to only 0.7\%. The irrigation
   system design, operation, calibration and cost are presented. Copyright

Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},

Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{289-303}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the processes of infiltration and water movement
   in the upper layers of blanket peat. A tension infiltrometer was used to
   measure hydraulic conductivity in a blanket peat in the North Pennines,
   England. Measurements were taken from the surface down to 20 cm in depth
   for peat under four different vegetation covers. It was found that
   macropore flow is a significant pathway for water in the upper layers of
   this soil type. It was also found that peat depth and surface vegetation
   cover were associated with macroporosity and saturated hydraulic
   conductivity. The proportion of macropore flow was found to be greater
   at 5 cm depth than at 0, 10 and 20 cm depth. Feat beneath a Sphagnum
   cover tends to be more permeable and a greater proportion of macropore
   flow can occur beneath this vegetation type. Functional macroporosity
   and matrix flow in the near-surface layers of bare peat appear to have
   been affected by weathering processes. Comparision of results with
   rainfall records demonstrates that infiltration-excess overland flow is
   unlikely to be a common runoff-generating mechanism on blanket pear;
   rather, a saturation-excess mechanism combined with percolation-excess
   above much less permeable layers dominates the runoff response.

Abstract = {{Seven temperature-based equations, each representing a typical form,
   were evaluated and compared for determining evaporation at two
   climatological stations (Rawson Lake and Atikokan) in north-western
   Ontario, Canada. The comparison was first made usings the original
   constant values involved in each equation, and then using the
   recalibrated constant values. The results show that when the original
   constant values were used, larger biases existed for most of the
   equations for both stations. When recalibrated constant values were
   substituted for the original constant values, six of the seven equations
   improved for both stations. Using locally calibrated parameter values,
   all seven equations worked well for determining mean seasonal
   evaporation values. For monthly evaporation values, the modified
   Blaney-Criddle method produced least error for all months for both
   stations, followed by the Hargreaves and Thornthwaite methods. The
   Linacre, Kharrufa and Hamon methods showed a significant bias in
   September for both stations. With properly determined constant values,
   the modified Blaney-Criddle, the Hargreaves and Thornthwaite methods can
   be recommended for estimating evaporation in the study region, as far as
   temperature-based methods are concerned. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Gully head and wall retreat has commonly been attributed to fluvial
   scour and head collapse as a result of soil saturation, sapping or
   piping. The empirical evidence to substantiate these conceptual models
   is sparse, however, and often contradictory. This paper explores the
   hydrological and mechanical controls on gully head and wall stability by
   modelling the hydrology, stability and elastic deformation of a marl
   gully complex in Granada Province, southeast Spain. The hydrological and
   slope-stability simulations show that saturated conditions can be
   reached only where preferential fissure flow channels water from tension
   cracks into the base of the gully head, and that vertical or subvertical
   heads will be stable unless saturation is achieved. Owing to the high
   unsaturated strengths of marl measured in this research, failure in
   unsaturated conditions is possible only where the gully head wall is
   significantly undercut. Head retreat thus requires the formation of
   either a tension crack or an undercut hollow. Finite-element stress
   analysis of eroding slopes reveals a build up of shear stress at the
   gully head base, and a second stress anomaly just upslope of the head
   wall. Although tension cracks on gully heads have often been attributed
   to slope unloading, this research provides strong evidence that the so
   called `sapping hollow' commonly found in the gully headwall base is
   also a function of stress release. Although further research is needed;
   it seems possible that `pop out' failures in river channels may be
   caused by the same process. The hydrological analysis shows that, once a
   tension crack has developed, throughflow velocity in the gully headwall
   will increase by an order of magnitude, promoting piping and enlargement
   of this weakened area. It is, therefore, possible to envisage a cycle of
   gully expansion in which erosion, channel incision or human action
   unloads the slope below a gully head, leading to stress patterns that
   account for the tension crack and a stress-release hollow. The tension
   crack promotes faster throughflow, encouraging hollow enlargement and
   piping, which undercut the gully head. The tension crack permits the
   development of positive porewater pressures behind the gully head,
   leading either to failure or contributing to toppling. Finally the
   debris may be eroded by fluvial action, unloading a new section of slope
   and completing the cycle of gully head retreat. Copyright (C) 2001 John

   and sandy clay till are reported.
   The experimental results show that seepage, by itself, has little effect
   on erosion rates. However, the erosion caused by rainfall is increased
   when seepage is present. The increased erosion was not caused by an
   increase in the total runoff from the seepage. It was found that seepage
   has an effect on the erodibility of the sand and sandy clay till. The
   results also show that the impact of seepage on the erodibility of the
   sand is greater than that of the sandy clay till. Copyright (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Excess stress parameters, critical shear stress (tau (c)) and
   erodibility coefficient (k(d)), for degrading channels in the loess
   areas of the midwestern USA are presented based on lit situ jet-testing
   measurements. Critical shear stress and k(d) are used to define the
   erosion resistance of the streambed. The jet-testing apparatus applies
   hydraulic stresses to the bed and the resulting scour due to the
   impinging jet is related to the excess stress parameters. Streams tested
   were primarily silt-bedded in texture with low densities, which is
   typical of loess soils. Results indicate that there is a wide variation
   in the erosion resistance of streambeds, spanning six orders of
   magnitude for tau (c) and four orders of magnitude for k(d). Erosion
   resistance was observed to vary within a streambed, from streambed to
   streambed, and from region to region. An example of the diversity of
   materials within a river system is the Yalobusha River Basin in
   Mississippi. The median value of tau (c) for the two primary bed
   materials, Naheola and Porters Creek Clay Formations, was 1.31 and 256
   Pa, respectively. Streambeds composed of the Naheola Formation are
   readily eroded over the entire range of shear stresses, whereas only the
   deepest flows generate boundary stresses great enough to erode
   streambeds composed of the Porters Creek Clay Formation. Therefore,
   assessing material resistance and location is essential in classifying

Abstract = {{Numerous processes may instigate bank retreat and the consequent
   collection of failed cohesive materials at the bank toe. Cohesion
   between the failed material and the substrate can provide additional
   strength to resist direct fluvial entrainment. Failed, cohesive material
   can act as a form of natural bank-toe protection by consuming and
   diverting flow energy that may otherwise be used to further scour the
   basal zone of incising channels.
   Investigations in Goodwin Creek, Mississippi, have revealed the
   existence of apparent cohesion between failed, cohesive blocks and their
   underlying surface. The method used to assess this cohesion involved a
   pulley system mounted on a tripod and supporting a load cell. Mean and
   maximum apparent-cohesion values of 1.08 kPa and 2.65 kPa, respectively,
   were measured in this way, identifying a source that bonds blocks to the
   underlying surface. Cohesion values and types vary spatially and
   temporally. Tensiometric tests beneath blocks suggest that cohesion
   resulting from matric suction alone may be as much as 3.5 kPa in summer
   and 1.8 kPa in winter.
   Apparent cohesion is believed to have been sufficient to help prevent
   removal of the largest blocks by a peak flow of 66.4 m(3)/s on 23
   September 1997. Maximum excess shear stress required to entrain a D-75
   block can be augmented by as much as 97\% by the presence of apparent
   cohesion at the block-substrate interface when compared with a condition
   with zero apparent cohesion at the block underside. Given these
   findings, it is no longer sufficient to estimate block entrainment in
   the basal area from block size or bed roughness alone, as in a
   Shields-type approach. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The main influences of plants on the mass stability of riverbanks are
   those that affect the strength of bank sediments. Plants enhance bank
   strength by reducing pore-water pressures and by directly reinforcing
   bank material with their roots. In this paper we do not consider bank
   hydrology but focus on quantifying increases in sediment strength due to
   root reinforcement. Root reinforcement is a function of root strength,
   interface friction between the roots and the soil, and the distribution
   of roots within the soil. Field and laboratory studies of Australian
   riparian trees, river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) and swamp
   paperbark (Melaleuca ericifolia), indicate that bank reinforcement, due
   to the roots of these species, decreases exponentially with depth below
   the soil surface and distance away from the trees. Differences in the
   spatial distribution of root reinforcement are illustrated by a
   comparison of the apparent cohesion due to roots (c(r)) with the
   effective cohesion of the saturated bank material (15 kPa). Directly
   below the river red gum, root reinforcement is equal to effective
   cohesion at 1.7 m depth. At the dripline (17 m from the trunk), root
   reinforcement is equal to material strength at 0.4 m depth. For the
   swamp paperbark, c(r) = 15 kPa at 1.1 m depth beneath surface, at the
   trunks, and at 0.4 m depth at the dripline (2.5 m from the trunk). A
   description of the spatial distribution of root reinforcement is
   important in the riverbank context. We find that interspecies
   differences in the strength of living roots have less significance for
   bank reinforcement than interspecies differences in root distribution.

Abstract = {{A lattice Boltzmann automaton (LBA) is used as a modelling approach to
   investigate the influence of pore-space geometry on intrinsic processes
   and component distributions in recent tidal sediments. The simulations
   are performed on real pore-space structures obtained from scanning
   electron photomicrographs, which document the mesoscopic geometry of
   bioactive sandy surface sediments. The discrete transport-reaction model
   for dissolved oxygen shows that in advective controlled systems;oxygen
   concentration properties can be clearly related to the pore-space
   geometry. Variability of measured high-resolution concentration
   gradients can therefore can be attributed to the structural
   heterogeneity of pore-space geometry. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Evaporation from a willow short-rotation forest was analysed using a
   modified version of the Shuttleworth-Wallace model. The main
   modification consisted of a two-layer soil module, which enabled soil
   surface resistance to be calculated as a function of the wetness of the
   top soil. Introduction of the threshold value of the leaf area index
   when scaling up from the leaf to the canopy resistance resulted in
   improvement to the simulated evaporation. The analysis was concentrated
   mainly on the 1988 season (May-October) when total evaporation was
   measured by the energy balance/Bowen ratio method throughout the growing
   season, covering all stages of canopy development. At the beginning of
   the 1994 season, soil evaporation were also measured with a ventilated
   chamber system. The general seasonal dynamics of the evaporation were
   fairly well simulated with the model. The largest deviation between
   measured and simulated evaporation occurred in June, when the model
   underestimated evaporation by about 1 mm day(-1). The model
   underestimated also in May but not as much as in June. In September and
   October the performance of the model was very good. For 130 days of the
   period May-October the cumulated measured evaporation was 364 mm and the
   simulated evaporation for the same days was 362 mm. It should be pointed
   out that this result was obtained without calibrating the model against
   the measured evaporation: The total simulated evaporation for the season
   was 450 mm with transpiration constituting 298 mm (66\%), soil
   evaporation 102 mm (23\%) and interception evaporation 50 mm (11\%). The
   sensitivity analysis showed, in general, that simulated evaporation was
   most sensitive to changes in resistances when the leaf area index was
   smallest, i.e. under non-closed canopy conditions. Changes in stomatal
   resistance, which is one of the most sensitive parameters, with
   associated changes in canopy transpiration, resulted in a negative
   feedback effect on soil evaporation. This reduced the total
   evaporation's sensitivity to stomatal resistance. This type of
   interaction between canopy and soil or undergrowth fluxes has been
   observed in other studies as well. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{An experimental landscape simulator has been developed which uses a
   rainfall simulator to create overland flow and erosion. The simulator
   uses rainfall sprinklers that eliminate rainsplash and an artificial
   soil which has little cohesion. Experimental landscapes developed in the
   simulator evolved according to Howard's headward growth model. Elements
   of Glock's model could be identified during evolution (i.e. initiation
   and maximum extension), but other stages of this model were not observed
   (i.e. extension and integration). The Horton concept of cross-grading
   and micropiracy and stream piracy was not observed despite the dominance
   of overland flow, nor the groundwater headward growth mechanism proposed
   by Dunne, the latter due to experimental design, which eliminated any
   perched groundwater table. The experimental apparatus produced model
   landscapes that are scaled-down analogues of real world processes.

Abstract = {{A hydrological model (YWB, yearly water balance) has been developed to
   model the daily rainfall-runoff relationship of the 202 km(2) Teba river
   catchment, located in semi-arid south-eastern Spain. The period of
   available data (1976-1993) includes some very rainy years with intensive
   storms (responsible for flooding parts of the town of Malaga) and also
   some very dry years.
   The YWB model is in essence a simple tank model in which the catchment
   is subdivided into a limited number of meaningful hydrological units.
   Instead of generating per unit surface: runoff resulting from
   infiltration excess, runoff has been made the result of storage excess.
   Actual evapotranspiration is obtained by means of curves, included in
   the software, representing the relationship between the ratio of actual
   to potential evapotranspiration as a function of soil moisture content
   for three soil texture classes.
   The total runoff generated is split between base flow and surface runoff
   according to a given baseflow index. The two components are routed
   separately and subsequently joined. A large number of sequential years
   can be processed, and the results of each year are summarized by a water
   balance table and a daily based rainfall runoff time series. An attempt
   has been made to restrict the amount of input data to the minimum.
   Interactive manual calibration is advocated in order to allow better
   incorporation of field evidence and the experience of the model user.
   Field observations allowed for an approximate calibration at the
   hydrological unit level. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Ice layers in snowpacks are thought to retard or obstruct gas and melt
   water flow through the pack, yet there has been little published
   information on the permeability of ice layers in seasonal snow. In this
   paper, investigations of ice layer permeabilities are reported for
   prominent ice layers 1 to 3 mm thick in a seasonal snowpack. For
   distinct, fairly solid ice layers 1 to 3 mm thick, permeabilities ranged
   from 1 to 19 x 10(-10) m(2); these values are significantly lower than
   values for the surrounding snow. Within 24 h early in the melt season,
   the permeability of the surface crust increased 160\%, from
   approximately 70 to 120 x 10(-10) m(2). This increase in permeability
   was accompanied by a small increase in grain size and a decrease in
   albedo. The snow-air interface can exhibit dramatic changes in transport
   properties over relatively short periods of time, even without
   precipitation events. These changes, driven by the surface meteorology,
   affect transport properties such as permeability as well as albedo.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the impact of sampling density on the determination of a
   glacier's annual mass balance, we used varying densities of measurements
   to determine annual mass balance on Columbia Glacier, Washington and

   field measurements. The density of the mass balance networks ranged from
   1 to 375 points km(-2). The smaller networks were subsamples of the
   highest measurement density network. The results on both glaciers
   indicate significant improvement in accuracy resulting from increasing
   the total number of measurements from 1 to 4 points km(-2) on Lemon
   Creek Glacier and 12 to 46 points km(-2) on Columbia Glacier. There was
   no significant improvement in accuracy on the smaller Columbia Glacier
   for utilizing more than 46 points km(-2). On Lemon Creek Glacier there
   was little improvement in mass balance assessment for a network greater
   than 4 points km(-2). On both glaciers this represented a network of 40

Abstract = {{Net solar radiation often dominates the snow surface energy exchange
   during ablation in many conifer forests. Reflection of solar radiation
   from the snow surface depends not only on snow properties, but also on
   forest litter lying on and within the snowpack. We know of no validated
   model reported in the literature that accounts for the influence of
   forest litter on snow surface energy exchanges. The purpose of this work
   is to test an existing algorithm's ability to accumulate forest litter
   in snow layers and to predict the subsequent effect of litter on the
   snow surface albedo. Field studies in a conifer stand of red
   spruce-balsam fir in northern Vermont, USA, provided key data for
   validation, including subcanopy radiation, meteorology, snow depth, and
   images of litter accumulation. We ran the litter algorithm coupled with
   the snow model SNTHERM for the ablation season, and predictions compared
   well with measurements of snow depth, snow surface litter coverage, and
   snow surface albedo beneath the conifer canopy. Model results suggest
   that for this forest and ablation season, the current litter algorithm
   realistically distributes litter in the snowpack through time with
   validated effects on snow surface litter concentration and albedo. The
   poor relationship between mean wind speed and change in litter coverage
   on the snow surface suggest that, for this forest and ablation season,
   incorporating wind events into the algorithm will not improve the
   results.}},

   modify meteorological forcing of snowcover. This project develops four
   numerical modules to simulate canopy processes including attenuation of

   The four modules and a more realistic atmospheric stability algorithm
   were included in the Utah Energy Balance (UEB) snow model to estimate
   water equivalence beneath coniferous and defoliated deciduous forests in
   northern Michigan. Systematic underestimation of early season snow depth
   was attributed to the assumption of constant, seasonal average, snow
   density in the model's lumped treatment of the snowpack processes. The
   modified UEB model (UEBMOD) improved estimation of snow depth in a
   clearing and beneath the coniferous site, whereas UEB with original
   forest parameterizations performed best for the deciduous site.

Abstract = {{This project developed an approach to spatially distribute snow modeling
   and monitoring procedures for estimating snowmelt inputs to the
   Sacramento and San Joaquin liver basins, California. The Distributed
   Snow Process Model (DSPM) implements a temperature index algorithm,
   SSARR-grid, for estimating total snow water equivalent (SWE) and liquid
   water arriving at the ground surface each hourly time step in each model
   cell with 2 km spatial resolution. DSPM used interpolated air
   temperature and precipitation measurements, as well as initial snow
   conditions derived from ground stations and satellite data. Air
   temperature interpolation incorporated hourly ambient lapse rates based
   on observed air temperatures and elevation in an
   inverse-distance-squared technique. Precipitation interpolation used an
   inverse-distance-squared method. We developed a linear function that
   specified the melt factor used by SSARR-grid in each cell depending on
   the accumulated temperature index. In this test, DSPM relied on maps of
   SWE for initiation and validation. We estimated the spatial distribution
   of SWE by combining estimates of snow cover area (SCA) with
   interpolations of SWE based on snow sensor and course measurements. SCA
   retrieval algorithms used measurements from the NOAA Advanced Very High
   Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) to estimate snow extent as fractional
   cover per pixel. SWE interpolations for this project used an algorithm
   similar to the temperature interpolation The results showed that SWE
   maps predicted by DSPM over periods up to several days agree well with
   maps produced from AVHRR merged with ground measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Passive-microwave derived observations of snow cover show potential to
   provide synoptically sensitive hydrologically and climatologically
   significant information because of all-weather imaging capabilities,
   rapid scene revisit time, and the ability to derive quantitative
   estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE). In this study, 10 winter
   seasons (December, January, February 1988/89 to 1997/98) of five day
   averaged (pentad) passive-microwave derived SWE imagery are utilized to
   examine the seasonal snow cover characteristics of a ground-validated
   North American Prairie study area. Principal components analysis (PCA)
   is used to identify the dominant spatial patterns through time for three
   passive-microwave derived datasets: (1) pentad SWE, (2) pentad SWE
   anomalies based on the 10 season mean and standard deviation, and (3)
   change-in-pentad SWE (Delta SWE) calculated by subtracting each SWE
   pattern from the previous. Interpretation of the component loading
   patterns indicates that the Delta SWE time series is best suited for the
   climatological application of identifying associations between snow
   cover and atmospheric circulation. Two dominant patterns are identified
   within the Delta SWE time series: the positive (negative) phase of
   principal component 1 captures a pattern of widespread SWE ablation
   (accumulation) in the south with accumulation (ablation) to the north.
   The positive (negative) phase of principal component two characterizes a
   meridional accumulation (ablation) zone oriented from the northwest to
   southeast of the study area. The National Center for Environmental
   Prediction (NCEP) gridded atmospheric data (500 mb geopotential height;
   700 mb temperature) are investigated in conjunction with the first two
   Delta SWE principal components to identify whether consistency exists in
   the atmospheric patterns associated, at no time lag, with these dominant
   Delta SWE modes. An investigation of composite and anomaly atmospheric
   fields illustrates that unique and consistent atmospheric circulation
   patterns are linked to the SWE components. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley

Abstract = {{In many snowmelt-dominated catchments, stream dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) levels typically increase rapidly as spring melt commences, peak
   before maximum discharge, and decrease quickly as melting continues. We
   present data from Deer Creek (Summit County, CO) that shows this
   distinctive flushing response of DOC during snowmelt runoff, with DOC
   stored in landscape soils flushed to the stream in response to
   infiltrating melt waters. Our prior studies show that asynchronous
   melting of the snowpack across the landscape causes the spring DOC flush
   to be initiated at different times throughout the catchment. In this
   study we quantify characteristics of the asynchronous melt and its
   effect on DOC flushing. We investigated whether a simple mixing model
   can be used to capture the essentials of the asynchronous melting of a
   seasonal snowpack and its controls on DOC transport. We divided the
   catchment into zones of aspect and elevation, which largely determine
   spatial and temporal variations in the distribution of snow. TOPMODEL
   was used to simulate the hydrology in each zone, and the simulated flow
   paths were routed through a simple DOC mixing model to predict
   contributions of DOC to the stream. The zonal responses were aggregated
   to give a predicted response of hydrology and DOC fluxes for the entire
   catchment. Our results indicate that asynchronous melting-which
   determines the timing of contributions of discharge and DOC to
   streamflow from different areas of the landscape-can be quantified using
   a simple modeling approach. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of premating light regimes on sexual reproduction and the
   production of spherical cells in Chloromonas sp.-D, a unicellular green
   snow alga, were studied using cross-mating strains 582C and 582D
   isolated from snowpacks associated with mixed hardwood-softwood forests
   in Whetstone Gulf State Park, Tughill Plateau, NY. Two pre-acclimation
   regimes were used, Vita-Lite as controls (530-700 nm peak) and blue
   light as experimentals (430-460 nm peak) prior to the mating
   experiments. In blue light, an increase in the number of matings and
   spherical cells (spheres) produced in the life cycle was observed as the
   photoperiod increased. This implies that longer photoperiods of blue
   light are more optimal for sexual reproduction in Chloromonas sp.-D than
   shorter ones. Under Vita-Lite, there was a significant increase in the
   number of matings and spheres with the extended 20 : 4 photoperiod
   compared with the shorter 14:10 photoperiod. Under blue light,
   significantly more matings and spheres occurred than under Vita-Lite
   using the same irradiance level of 95 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)
   (photosynthetically active radiation {[}PAR] of 400-700 nm) for the
   14:10 and 20:4 photoperiods. The results of these experiments suggest
   that Chloromonas sp.-D, known only from the Tughill Plateau, NY, is not
   reproducing optimally at this site where it grows and reproduces under
   an approximate 14: 10 photoperiod in early April. However, in the upper
   10 cm of snow in the Tughill Plateau, a blue light irradiance level of
   95 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) occurs, which is optimal for this species.
   When these conditions are combined with a 14: 10 photoperiod, the
   Tughill Plateau appears to be sub-optimal for mating and production of
   spherical cells. Since Chloromonas sp.-D does not appear to have a
   dependence on a dark cycle, this would allow it to expand its
   geographical distribution. It may reproduce more optimally under blue
   light (95 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) with an extended photoperiod (>20
   : 4 h, light:dark) in high latitude field sites such as Lake Bienville,
   Quebec, in eastern North America where other species of Chloromonas are
   known in snow associated with coniferous forests. Copyright (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Research beginning 40 years ago suggested that semi-arid lands of the
   USA have higher unit discharges for a given recurrence interval than
   occur in other areas. Convincing documentation and Br arguments for this
   suspicion, however, were not presented. Thus, records of measured
   rainfall intensities for specified durations and recurrence intervals,
   and theoretical depths of probable maximum precipitation for specified
   recurrence intervals and areal scales an considered here for comparing
   extreme rainfalls of semi-arid areas with those of other climatic areas.
   Runoff from semi-arid lands, as peaks of rare floods, is compared with
   that of other areas using various published records. Relative to humid
   areas, semi-arid parts of the conterminous USA have lower 100-year, 6-h
   rainfall intensities and smaller depths of 100-year probable maximum
   precipitation for 26-km(2) areas. Nonetheless, maximum flood peaks,
   flash-flood potentials, and runoff potentials are generally larger in
   semi-arid areas than in more humid parts of the nation. Causes of this
   disparity between rainfall and runoff appear to be results of soil and
   vegetation that in humid areas absorb and intercept rainfall and
   attenuate runoff, but in semi-arid areas limit infiltration and enhance
   runoff from bare, crusted surfaces. These differences in soil and
   vegetation conditions are indicated by the relatively high curve numbers
   and drainage densities that are typical of semi-arid areas. Owing to
   soil and vegetation conditions, rare floods in semi-arid areas are more
   likely to cause landform change than are floods of similar magnitude
   elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past 30 years, ecologists have demonstrated the importance of
   flow and temperature as primary variables in driving running water,
   riparian and floodplain ecosystems. As it is important to assess the
   size and timing of discharge variations in relation to those in
   temperature, a method is proposed that uses multivariate techniques to
   separately classify annual discharge and temperature regimes according
   to their `shape' and `magnitude', and which then combines the
   classifications. This paper: (i) describes a generally applicable
   method, (ii) tests the method by applying it to riparian systems on four
   British rivers using a 20-year record (1977-97) of flow and air
   temperature; (iii) proposes a hydroecological interpretation of the
   classification; (iv) considers the degree to which the methodology might
   provide information to support the design of ecologically acceptable
   flow regimes.
   `Regimes' are defined for discharge and air temperature using monthly
   mean data. The results of applying the classification procedure to four
   British rivers indicates that the `typical' regimes for each of the four
   catchments are composite features produced by a small number of clearly
   defined annual types that reflect interannual variability in
   hydroclimatological conditions. Annual discharge patterns are dominated
   by three `shape' classes (accounting for 94\% of the station years:
   class A, early (November) peak; class B, intermediate (December-January)
   peak; and class C, late (March) peak) and one `magnitude' class (70\% of
   the station years fall into class 3, intermediate), with two subordinate
   `magnitude' classes: low-flow years (18\%) and high flow years (12\%).
   For air temperature, annual patterns are classified evenly into three
   `shape' and four `magnitude' classes. It is argued that this variety of
   flow-temperature patterns is important for sustaining ecosystem
   integrity and for establishing benchmark flow regimes and associated
   frequencies to aid river management. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

   in severity from effects of debris flows, which completely remove
   alluvium, riparian soil and vegetation along steep, narrow, low-order
   channels, to localized patches of trees toppled by floating logs along
   the margins of larger channels. Land-use practices can affect the
   cascade of geomorphological processes that function as disturbance
   agents by changing the frequency and spatial pattern of events and the
   quantity and size distribution of material moved. A characterization of
   the disturbance regime in a stream network has important implications
   for ecological analysis. The network structure of stream and riparian
   systems, for example, may lend resilience in response to major
   disturbances by providing widely distributed refuges. An understanding
   of disturbance regime is a foundation for designing management systems.

Abstract = {{The flood pulse concept of Junk, Bayley and Sparks is a major
   contribution to our understanding of river-floodplain interactions and
   has become an important paradigm in lotic ecology. The concept is based
   mainly on large tropical lowland rivers. Floodplains may, however,
   develop in all geographical areas and at different locations along a
   river corridor. We extend this concept to temperate areas by including
   information derived from near-natural proglacial, headwater and lowland
   floodplains. Specific attention is directed to the role of temperature
   as a major determinant of floodplain ecology. Further attention is
   directed to the importance of expansion-contraction cycles occurring
   well below bankfull ('flow pulse' versus `flood pulse'). Selected
   examples are presented that highlight the complexity of
   expansion-contraction events and their consequences on habitat
   heterogeneity and functional processes. Habitat heterogeneity is mainly
   a product of shifting water sources, different how paths and the
   relative importance of autogenic processes. In different floodplain
   systems, expansion may enhance habitat heterogeneity (e.g. glacial
   floodplain) or create homogeneity (e.g. Danubian floodplain). Further,
   the ecological consequences of episodic flow and flood pulses are
   discussed. Finally, a landscape approach is suggested in order to
   document expansion and contraction processes and to elucidate how these
   processes influence landscape heterogeneity and biodiversity patterns.
   Such a landscape-based ecosystem model can be applied to rigorously
   assess the ecological integrity of river-floodplain systems. Copyright

Abstract = {{In the past, plant physiological studies have contributed substantial
   understanding of the behaviour of plants with respect to hydrological
   processes in vegetation and the effects of deficits and surpluses of
   water on plants. In this paper progress in some important current fields
   of plant physiological research, with particular relevance to
   ecohydrology, are examined.
   The control of water loss by plants, through manipulation of stomatal
   opening and amounts of foliage, is examined. Models that describe the
   control of stomatal behaviour by a combination of hydraulic and chemical
   signalling combined with transpiration flux have emerged in recent
   years. There is, however, a need for detailed testing of such models in
   field situations, particularly with large woody vegetation. Forest
   transpiration is examined in detail. In traditional broadleaves and
   conifers in temperate regions transpiration is modest and similar
   between forests. A number of factors are considered to explain the
   situation. A strong negative association of stomatal conductance with
   air humidity deficit is thought to relate to the low overall
   transpiration. High transpiration rates are associated with large
   stomatal conductances, which show little reduction in association with
   increased air humidity deficits. Soil moisture deficits have less impact
   in forests with inherently low transpiration.
   There is growing interest in the mechanisms of competition for soil
   water between plants growing together. Studies have been aided recently
   by the feasibility of direct measurements of root hydraulic
   conductivity. Further understanding of patterns of water uptake by roots
   has emerged, with new approaches involving sap flow and stable isotope
   techniques.
   Physiologists have provided considerable insight into controls of water
   loss at the individual leaf or plant level. At the larger scale of the
   vegetation stand, the leaf control may be modified considerably
   depending on the structure of the vegetation, which influences coupling
   with the atmosphere. In tall, rough vegetation, such as forests and
   woodlands, the coupling is strong, so that the stomatal control of
   transpiration at the leaf level is maintained at the canopy level.
   In recent studies with forest vegetation, declines in transpiration have
   been observed to occur after a few to several decades from establishment
   of the forest. These reductions in transpiration can have significant
   influences on streamflow. In parallel, physiological studies have
   provided explanations both in terms of declining leaf area but also due
   to reductions in stomatal conductance, as a consequence of reductions in
   hydraulic conductivity of woody tissues. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley

Abstract = {{This paper reviews current knowledge of the effect of forest type,
   ground cover and climate on rainfall partitioning into throughfall,
   stemflow and interception. It considers the variety and reliability of
   measurement techniques that have been used and interprets the results of
   interception studies in relation to methodological, vegetational and
   climatic factors. The review illustrates that it is difficult to draw
   general conclusions about interception losses by particular forest types
   because they almost always depend on the type of rainfall and other
   meteorological conditions during the study period. Characteristics of a
   forest that affect interception are not always easy to identify and
   quantify. Characteristics such as trees/ha, branch angle, the uniformity
   or lack of uniformity in crown height, the nature and thickness of the
   bark layer, leaf shape and inclination, and leaf area index will all
   influence interception. The major difficulty is reliable estimation of
   throughfall. It is not unusual for measured throughfall to exceed the
   rainfall value, causing interception to be negative. The difficulty in
   estimation of throughfall is discussed. while also addressing the need
   for accurate measurement of rainfall. In forests where stemflow volumes
   are large enough to significantly influence the interception values, the
   methodological approach is even more difficult. Measurement of
   interception on a periodic basis presents fewer problems than estimation
   on an individual event basis because the variables that affect the
   values of throughfall and stemflow can change over very short periods,
   for example the intensity and angle of rainfall, and wind speed and
   direction. However, carefully conducted event-based studies can quantify
   the influence of a number of the variables. Copyright (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{Rainfall-simulation experiments have been carried out on a series of
   plots ranging in size from 1 m(2) to c 500 m(2) in order to observe
   process and flux-rate changes resulting from the replacement of the
   dominant vegetation type from grassland to shrubland in the American
   South-west. Results have demonstrated variations in infiltration rates,
   flow hydraulics, splash and interrill erosion rates and nutrient
   transport rates. Furthermore, the shrubland areas develop rills, which
   are responsible for significant increases in overall erosion rates. The
   small-plot experiments allow the definition of controlling factors on
   the processes, and highlight the importance of vegetation controls.
   Although the small-plot approach has a number of significant advantages,
   it also has a number of disadvantages, which are discussed in detail.
   Some of these problems can be overcome with a careful consideration of
   experimental design. It is argued that plot-scale studies play an
   important part in improving our understanding of complex, open systems,
   but need to be integrated with other approaches such as the monitoring
   of natural events and computer modelling so that mutually consistent
   understandings of complex ecohydrological systems can be achieved.

Abstract = {{This paper describes initial work modelling unsaturated processes within
   floodplain wetlands. The limitations of solely considering the dynamics
   of the wetland water table and hence saturated processes are examined.
   Water table, precipitation and evapotranspiration data from Narborough
   Bog, a degraded floodplain wetland of 10 ha in Leicestershire, were used
   in the development of a one-dimensional saturated-unsaturated flow model
   using UNSAT1. Hydraulic parameters were derived from a combination of
   field and laboratory analysis of wetland deposits previously undertaken
   to develop a saturated flow model of the wetland. Additional parameters
   describing unsaturated flow were derived by a mathematical approximation
   based upon the soil moisture characteristic of representative wetland
   sediments. The resulting model is used to explore the interaction
   between water table position, vertical soil moisture fluxes and
   evapotranspiration. Model simulations are completed over a 25-day
   period, and used to indicate the relationship of moisture content to key
   hydraulic properties of soil profiles typical of the wetland and
   illustrate the way in which this varies laterally along a transect. The
   results highlight the need to consider the importance of correct
   description of the wetland substrate and, notwithstanding difficulties
   in describing unsaturated flow parameters, there is a considerable need
   to improve the description of near-surface wetland water fluxes and
   their expansion to two dimensions. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The main impacts of riparian vegetation on hydrological processes are
   briefly reviewed in order to highlight needs and perspectives for
   research and management goals. This review is based upon three distinct
   influences of riparian vegetation on hydrological processes: (i) the
   control of runoff, i.e. the physical impact of living and dead plants on
   hydraulics, (ii) the impact of plant physiology on water uptake, storage
   and return to the atmosphere, and (iii) the impact of riparian
   vegetation functioning on water quality. Riparian vegetation influences
   runoff through complex hydraulic interactions during baseflows as well
   as overbank flows. The contribution of fine vegetational structures to
   landscape hydrological roughness needs to be considered in relation to
   the spatial complexity (patchiness, vertical stratification,
   rhizosphere) and temporal variability (phenology, succession) of plant
   communities. With the exception of some woody species, the uptake,
   storage and return of water to the atmosphere is poorly known for
   riparian communities, and therefore the assessment of the regional
   hydrological importance of the riparian corridor remains difficult to
   estimate. Although better understood than the above two influences of
   riparian vegetation on hydrological processes, there are still a number
   of unresolved issues concerning the role of riparian vegetation in
   controlling water quality. In particular, little is known about the
   coupling of microbial and vegetational functions in nutrient cycling and
   the dynamics of carbon release from coarse and fine plant debris. The
   influence of vegetation complexity and plant diversity on both
   qualitative and quantitative aspects of water cycling remains an
   important area for future research. Fundamental and management issues
   are identified in relation to the use of riparian vegetation as a model
   and as a tool. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Riparian vegetation is affected by both flood processes and the
   characteristics of landforms that are shaped by floods. In many
   instances, species occurrence can be linked directly to specific fluvial
   landforms. These spatial relationships are largely due to the role of
   floods in the differential destruction of vegetation, in the
   determination of substrate characteristics, and in the transport of
   propagules. Major floods may, depending on the climatic context, allow
   for the establishment of stands of vegetation, or restart processes of
   plant community change. Disturbance by floods can also affect
   biodiversity: species richness in some watersheds is greatest where
   steep valley floor gradients allow for high-energy floods.
   The recognition and analysis of hydrogeomorphological influences on
   riparian vegetation are complicated by multiple scales of environmental
   interactions, by the covariance of some environmental variables, and by
   feedbacks between vegetation and flood regimes. Copyright (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{Rivers of the coastal plain of the south-eastern USA are
   characteristically low-gradient meandering systems that develop broad
   floodplains subjected to frequent and prolonged flooding. These
   floodplains support a relatively unique forested wetland (bottomland
   hardwoods), which have received considerable ecological study, but
   distinctly less hydrogeomorphological study. The hydroperiod, or annual
   period of inundation, largely controls the development of characteristic
   fluvial landforms, sediment deposition and vegetation distribution
   patterns. Order-of-magnitude differences in wetted perimeter,
   width/depth, suspended sediment load and hydraulic roughness may exist
   between `dry' in-channel seasons and the hydroperiod. Substantial
   sediment (and adsorbed contaminants) retention and storage through
   lateral and vertical accretion is common (where not heavily impacted by
   flow regulation) along these Coastal Plain rivers. The present chapter
   summarizes our current understanding of the hydrology, fluvial
   geomorphology, general and local sedimentation patterns, and related
   plant ecological patterns of these Coastal Plain bottomlands.}},

Abstract = {{Many authors have shown that the sedimentology of former channels and
   subsequent vegetation changes are controlled by temporal (flood events
   and successional processes) and spatial (e.g. distance to the main
   channel) factors. River channel instability can disrupt these
   associations. The Ain River, France, has undergone a fluvial
   metamorphosis during the past 100 years, its braided pattern being
   replaced by a sinuous single-thread pattern. As a consequence, former
   channels have different geometrical characteristics and sediment trap
   efficiencies. Former meandering channels experience more frequent
   backflows and are more rapidly silted than the older former braided
   channels. The recently abandoned channels are characterized by the
   development of large-sized vegetation species with a relatively slow
   colonization rate, whereas the older channels are colonized
   predominantly by flood-tolerant aquatic plants. The locally derived
   discharge of former channels (from groundwater or from their own basin)
   may reduce or prevent sediment entry during flood events and thus may
   decrease the sedimentation rate. In such cases, the oligotrophic
   component of the water from the hillslope aquifer is high and the former
   channel is usually nutrient-poor, characterized by oligotrophic species.
   The main river channel also has experienced local incision, aggradation
   and horizontal displacement during recent decades, so that the dynamics
   of the former channels strongly depend on the dynamics of the reach in
   which they are located. In degraded reaches, former channels are often
   dry, and helophyte species have been replaced by mesophytes. The
   frequency and magnitude of flow connection between the river channel and
   the former channel can increase or decrease owing to the movement of the
   active river channel within the fluvial corridor, inducing varying
   modifications of former channel vegetation patterns. River channel
   instability at various time-scales is a key-factor controlling process
   diversity and thus biodiversity in the fluvial corridor. It can modify
   the geometry of abandoned channels, groundwater fluxes, the amount,
   mobilization and deposition of sediment within the corridor, and
   consequently the vegetation community patterns. This increases the
   complexity of successional patterns, because an old former channel may
   be characterized by pioneer species whereas a younger one can become
   quickly filled and colonized by terrestrial species. Copyright (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Large floods can have major impacts on riparian forests. Here we examine
   the variability and spatial distribution of riparian forest responses
   along eight third- to fifth-order streams following a large flood (
   similar to 100 year recurrence interval) in the Cascade Mountain Range
   of Oregon, We categorized disturbance intensity (physical force) exerted
   on riparian trees during floods into three classes: (i) purely fluvial
   (high water flow only); (ii) fluvial supplemented by dispersed pieces of
   floating wood (uncongested wood transport); (iii) fluvial with movement
   of batches of wood (congested wood transport). These types of material
   transport and associated classes of disturbance intensity resulted in a
   gradient of biotic responses of disturbance severity ranging from
   standing riparian trees inundated by high water, to trees toppled but
   still partially rooted, to complete removal of trees. High within-stream
   and among stream responses were influenced by pre-flood stream and
   riparian conditions as well as flood dynamics, especially the
   availability of individual pieces or congested batches of wood.
   Fluvial disturbance alone toppled fewer riparian trees than in reaches
   where floodwaters transported substantial amounts of wood. Debris flows
   delivered additional wood and sediment to parts of reaches of four of
   these study streams; riparian trees were removed and toppled for up to
   1.5 km downstream of the debris flow tributary channel. Congested wood
   transport resulted in higher frequency of toppled trees and greater
   deposition of new wood levees along channel margins. The condition of
   the landscape at the time of a major flood strongly influenced responses
   of riparian forests. Recent and historic land-use practices, as well as
   the time since the previous large flood, influenced not only the
   structure and age of the riparian forests, but also the availability of
   agents of disturbance, such as large pieces of floating wood, that
   contribute to disturbance of riparian forests during floods. Copyright

Abstract = {{The findings of a 14-year study of tree reproduction and survival in the
   Platte River, Nebraska, are presented. The study was initiated in 1985
   to determine the causes and remedies of woodland expansion and channel
   narrowing, which have reduced potential roosting habitat for migratory
   avifauna such as the whooping crane and sandhill crane.
   A total of 296 relocatable sites, constituting some 600 plots with
   Populus and Salix seedlings, was selected and sampled within two reaches
   near Shelton and Odessa, Nebraska. The fate of some 37 000 tree
   seedlings was monitored within the plot network.
   Tree recruitment is controlled largely by stream flow in June. Populus
   and Salix produce large numbers of seedlings in the river bed in most
   years, indicating the potential for high rates of woodland expansion. On
   average, in only 1 year in 7 is stream flow in June high enough to
   preclude Populus and Salix recruitment.
   Seedling mortality is dominated by two environmental factors: summer
   stream flow pulses from thunderstorms, which erode or bury new
   germinants, and river bed restructuring by moving ice in winter. A third
   factor, seedling mortality by desiccation during summer droughts, does
   occur but at a low frequency.
   Plots of seedlings had extremely low survival rates over the course of
   the study. Forty-two per cent of the plots lost all seedlings by the
   first remeasurement (July to September), 36\% by the second measurement
   (May), and 10\% by the third remeasurement (July). Thus nearly 90\% of
   the plots had lost all tree seedlings by the end of the first year,
   These results explain why the Platte River has come into dynamic
   equilibrium with respect to the balance between active channel and
   woodland area. Low rates of new woodland expansion are counterbalanced
   by erosion of established woodland.
   The demographic approach to studying ecohydrology can be adapted to
   monitor the effectiveness of prescribed flows as insurance against
   future narrowing. Flows prescribed at key times to raise seedling
   mortality rates are recommended to maintain or widen channels, rather
   than mechanical clearing of established woodland. Copyright (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Management of river flows has altered the pattern of flood arrival times
   and reduced their frequency and duration on many European floodplains.
   Floodplain toe species depend on floods both to provide new sites for
   their regeneration and to recharge water tables at various depths in the
   rooting zone. A reduction in floods is one factor that has led to loss
   of river corridor biodiversity, with early successional tree species
   from the Salicaceae being particularly adversely affected. Members of
   the Salicaceae are dioecious and it is possible that the males and
   females of these species have measurably different water table
   requirements, which might lead to spatial segregation of the sexes on a
   floodplain. This paper describes an investigation that was carried out
   into the response of male and female black poplar (Populus nigra L.
   subspecies betulifolia (Pursh) W. Wettst.) to different soil moisture
   conditions. An experiment was set up on an alluvial island in the River
   Great Ouse (UK) in which cuttings of male and female black poplar were
   grown in different sediment types with different water table levels. The
   experiment was carried out over two held seasons in 1997 and 1998.
   Results showed that females tended to prefer wetter and more
   nutrient-rich sites than males but that there was considerable overlap
   in their requirements. A complementary genetic study showed very little
   genetic variation in the experimental population, which may also
   partially explain the relatively low level of variation between the two
   sexes found in the study. It is suggested that some limited spatial
   segregation of the sexes does occur in response to soil moisture
   availability and that river flow management which aims to maintain or
   increase river corridor biodiversity may need to take this into account.

Abstract = {{As the distribution and abundance of vegetation in drylands is often
   controlled by the greater availability of water along river channels,
   riparian vegetation has the potential to influence significantly dryland
   river form, process and behaviour, This paper demonstrates how a small
   indigenous shrub, the inland teatree (Melaleuca glomerata), influences
   the formation and maintenance of anabranching channels in a reach of the
   ephemeral Marshall River, Northern Plains, and central Australia. Here,
   the Marshall is characterized by ridge-form anabranching, where water
   and sediment are routed through subparallel, multiple channels of
   variable size which occur within a typically straight channel-train.
   Channels are separated by channel-train ridges - narrow, flow-aligned,
   vegetated features - or by wider islands. By providing a substantial
   element of boundary roughness, dense stands of teatrees growing on
   channel beds or atop the ridges and islands influence flow velocities,
   flow depths and sediment transport, resulting in how diversion, bank and
   floodplain erosion, and especially sediment deposition. Ridges and
   islands represent a continuum of forms, and their formation and
   development can be divided into a three-stage sequence involving teatree
   growth and alluvial sedimentation.
   (1) Teatrees colonize a flat, sandy channel bed, initiating the
   formation of ridges by lee-side accretion. Individual ridges grow
   laterally, vertically and longitudinally and maintain a geometrically
   similar streamlined (lemniscate) form that presents minimum drag.
   (2) Individual ridges grow in size, and interact with neighbouring
   ridges, causing the lemniscate forms to become distorted. Ridges in the
   lee of other ridges tend to be protected from the erosive effects of
   floods and survive, whereas individual teatrees or small ridges exposed
   to flow concentrated between larger ridges, lend to be removed.
   (3) Ridges lengthen, and coalesce with downstream ridges, eventually
   subdividing the channel-train into well-defined anabranches.
   This sequence turns a channel, initially obstructed with dense and
   chaotic stands of teatrees, into a well-organized system of ridge-form
   anabranches. In the moderate- to low-gradient Marshall River, which is
   colonized by an abundance of within-channel vegetation and subject to
   declining downstream discharges, this helps to minimize flow resistance,
   thereby maintaining an efficient water and sediment flux. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The mechanisms by which entrained planktonic organisms survive in river
   systems, despite an inexorable, unidirectional downstream transport, are
   revisited. The importance of channel retentivity to downstream
   population recruitment is emphasized. The aggregated dead-zone (ADZ)
   model is shown to be adequate to explain downstream recruitment of a
   growing population. The ADZ behaviour is more prevalent in sinuous,
   low-gradient reaches than in other parts of the river. Plankton
   selection and dynamics relate conspicuously to flow at higher discharges
   but other environmental features are important at low flows. Discharge
   variability is pivotal to the opportunities for potamoplankton to
   thrive. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the macroinvertebrate community in response to flow
   variations in the Little Stour River, Kent, UK, were examined over a 6
   year period (1992-1997). This period included the final year of the
   1988-1992 drought, followed by some of the wettest conditions recorded
   this century and a second period of drought between 1996 and 1997. Each
   year, samples were collected from 15 sites during late-summer base-flow
   conditions. Correspondence analysis identified clear differences between
   samples from upstream and downstream sites, and between drought and
   non-drought years. Step-wise multiple regression was used to identify
   hydrological indicators of community variation. Several different
   indices were used to describe the macroinvertebrate community, including
   macroinvertebrate community abundance, number of families and species,
   and individual species. Site characteristics were fundamental in
   accounting for variation in the unstandardized macroinvertebrate
   community. However, when differences between sites were controlled,
   hydrological conditions were found to play a dominant role in explaining
   ecological variation. Indices of high discharge (or their absence), 4-7
   months prior to sampling (i.e. winter-spring), were found to be the most
   important variables for describing the late-summer community. The
   results are discussed in relation to the role of flow variability in
   shaping instream communities and management implications. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Rivers fed by glaciers constitute a major part of the freshwater runoff
   into the Cook Inlet basin of south-central Alaska. This basin is very
   important to the economy of the State of Alaska because it is home to
   more than half of the population and it supports multi-million dollar
   commercial, subsistence and sport fisheries. Hence an understanding of
   how glacial runoff influences biological productivity is important for
   managing rivers that drain into Cook Inlet. This paper examines the ways
   in which the regulation of glacier-fed rivers by proglacial lakes
   affects salmon productivity, with particular reference to the Kenai
   River. Salmon escapement per unit channel length on the Kenai River is
   between two and ten times that found for rain-and-snowmelt dominated
   rivers and glacier-fed rivers lacking lake regulation.
   Lakes are shown to influence biological processes in glacier-fed rivers
   by attenuating peak flows, sustaining high flows throughout the summer,
   supplementing winter low flows, settling suspended sediment, and
   increasing river temperatures. Downstream from large lakes, glacier-fed
   rivers are less disturbed, channels are relatively stable and have
   well-developed salmonid habitats. The positive influences are indicated
   by the high diversity and abundances of benthic macroinvertebrates,
   which are important food resources for juvenile salmonids. High summer
   hows allow access for up-river salmon runs and lakes also provide both
   overwintering and rearing habitat. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The summer distribution of distinct mesohabitats (gravel, sand, silt,
   Ranunculus beds and emergent vegetation patches) at four 100-m sections
   along the length of a lowland river was studied over 3 years, together
   with their associated faunal assemblages. Habitat proportions in the
   sections showed little change between 1995 and 1997 at the uppermost
   site, in contrast to major changes downstream, which included an
   increase in percentage cover of Ranunculus from 10\% in 1995 to 50\% in
   1996. There did not appear to be a significant relationship between
   summer or winter discharge and the proportions of mesohabitat, but there
   were indications that stream macrophyte areas were high when the
   preceding winter flows were low.
   Multivariate analysis of the faunal/site matrix showed that the
   principal source of variation was the mesohabitat composition.
   Superimposed over this was a site component where the uppermost site was
   separated from the intermediate sites, which in turn were separated from
   the most downstream site. Annual changes in faunal composition appeared
   to be the least significant overall but this varied with site, with
   little difference at the uppermost site and clear differences between
   1995 and the other two years at the other sites. Ranunculus beds showed
   the least change between years. The highest number of taxa was found in
   emergent or marginal vegetation at all sites, with Ranunculus and sand
   supporting the lowest number. Mean abundance was greatest in Ranunculus
   and gravel samples, intermediate in emergent vegetation and silt, and
   lowest in sand.
   In order to investigate the implications of habitat changes, mean
   abundance of taxa per mesohabitat per year was compared with total
   abundance in the 100-m section for which habitat information was
   available. The total mean abundance of macroinvertebrates per
   mesohabitat was greatest in 1995 but this is not reflected in the total
   abundance per section. Mesohabitat abundances were greatest in
   Ranunculus, silt and emergent vegetation in 1995 but these mesohabitats
   were poorly represented in the section. In 1996, Ranunculus increased in
   area and this was reflected in higher total abundance. In 1997, the mean
   number of animals per mesohabitat was less than in previous years and
   this resulted in low overall abundance for the reach, Thus, the changes
   in habitat proportions controlled annual changes in total reach
   abundance and composition. Such changes have implications for the
   interpretation of biomonitoring and river habitat survey results whereby
   misleading conclusions may be drawn without considering annual and
   spatial fluctuations in habitat proportions. Copyright (C) 2000 John

   disturbed by passing clasts. A series of 82 sensors is housed in an
   aluminum beam placed across the stream, inserted such that its surface
   is flush with the gravel bed. The device can be raised or lowered to
   compensate for bed aggradation and scour. A data acquisition system
   gathers voltage signals from the sensors at rates of 30 to 100 Hz. This
   device is sensitive enough to record the movement of most volcanic,
   metamorphic, granitic and ultramafic clasts larger than a few
   millimetres.
   O'Ne-ell Creek watershed is a 68 km(2) tributary basin of the Middle
   River drainage system in the northern headwaters of the Fraser River.
   Bedload transport generally occurs twice a year in the Stuart-Takla
   streams: once during spring floods and again during salmon spawning
   activity. Bedload moved only during two days in 1998, at the peak of the
   relatively small nival food in May. Nevertheless, the device detected at
   least 3 x 10(6) passing clasts. A continuous record of bedload transport
   was obtained, showing a pulsating pattern of activity seemingly
   independent of stage, lateral movement of the transport zone, and a
   sudden onset of bed movement with a tapered cessation.
   We anticipate that more sophisticated calibration of the sensors and
   accelerated sampling rates will provide detailed information on the size
   and/or velocity and magnetic permeability of particles moving over the
   device, and will contribute to a better understanding of bedload
   transport. Copyright (C), 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrological systems near the terminus of a high Arctic glacier and a
   proglacial icing on Bylot Island, Canada, were investigated using
   ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The ice thickness and the location and
   depth of tunnels within the glacier and icing were imaged. Modelling of
   the GPR response was utilized to predict the data quality and to assist
   in its interpretation. The unique properties of the ice enabled velocity
   determinations from the diffraction patterns generated by point-source
   reflectors as well as traditional velocity surveys. The propagation
   velocity of the radar pulses through the ice depended on the air and
   water content in the ice. The identification of drainage tunnels was
   attained through pulse polarity analysis and interpolation between the
   profiles in gridded surveys, it was found that reflectivity analysis may
   enable GPR to be used for acquiring three-dimensional information on the
   thermal structure of glaciers. The much more complicated structure of
   the icing was imaged with higher frequency antennae and it was found
   that general ice types could be mapped using radar stratigraphical
   analysis. Both buried slush mounds and subsurface channel fills were
   identified within the icing. A portion of the icing near the centre of
   the valley floor, that has persisted perennially for over 50 years, was
   found to be sitting on a slightly higher area of the valley bottom and
   thus was not subjected to the same hydrothermal erosional forces as the
   edges of the icing, setting up a feed-back loop encouraging the
   preservation of the central core of ice and promoting the destruction
   and rebuilding of the edges every year. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Physically based equations describing snow interception and sublimation
   processes were applied to canopy-intercepted snow using a fractal
   scaling technique to provide a snow-covered forest boundary condition
   for a one-dimensional land surface scheme. Modification of the land
   surface scheme's calculation of turbulent transfer and within-canopy
   ambient humidity was required to accommodate this nested control volume
   approach. Tests in late winter in a southern boreal forest mature jack
   pine stand against measured sublimation found that the coupled model
   provides good approximations of sublimation losses on half-hourly and
   event bases. Daily sublimation averaged 0.5 kg m(-2) daily, with minimum
   and maximum daily losses of 0.16 and 0.72 kg m(-2). Cumulative errors in
   estimating canopy temperature, humidity and intercepted snow load over 7
   days of simulation were -0.7 K, -4.15\% of the average observed vapour
   pressure, and 0.103 kg m(-2), respectively. At a nearby regenerating
   jack pine site, measured peak latent heat ranged from -14.6 W m(-2) to
   -40.9 W m(-2). Testing of the model at this site yielded reasonable
   estimates of latent and sensible heat fluxes during an overnight event,
   but did not estimate latent heat nux as well during events involving
   larger snow loads and incoming solar radiation, possibly as a result of
   errors introduced by solving for within-canopy humidity and neglect of
   subcanopy snow energetics. Further work to improve heat storage terms,
   and the inclusion of subcanopy snow energetics could help improve the
   coupled model performance. Copyright (C) 1000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent and
   covariance between spatial distributions of ablation and snow water
   equivalent on depletion of snowcover was investigated in the boreal
   forest of central Saskatchewan, Canada. Changes in the spatial
   distributions of snow water equivalent were measured before and during
   melt in five stands, ranked by canopy density as: black spruce, jack
   pine, mixed wood, burned and recent clear-cut. The pre-melt frequency
   distribution of snow water equivalent within forest stands was found to
   fit a log normal distribution. Higher variability in snow water
   equivalent resulted in earlier exposure of ground under spatially
   uniform melt simulations, confirming the previous findings of others for
   open environments. The spatial distribution of daily ablation within
   stands was found, however, to be correlated inversely to thr
   distribution of snow water equivalent. This negative covariance between
   snow water equivalent and ablation further accelerated snow cover
   depletion. The combined acceleration as a result of variance of snow
   water equivalent and covariance with ablation was greatest in mixed-wood
   stands and smallest in burned and spruce stands. Simulations that
   included the within-stand covariance of ablation and snow water
   equivalent showed improved fit with measured data over those that only
   considered the effect of the distribution of snow water equivalent on

Abstract = {{Many headwater wetlands contain seasonally or permanently saturated
   areas adjacent to streams, in small depressions or in regional or local
   groundwater discharge zones. Environmental isotopes indicate that
   pre-event water dominates the storm period from these headwater
   wetlands, however, saturated overland flow usually dominates stormflow
   at these sites supposedly making groundwater contributions relatively
   less important as a runoff mechanism. Mixing of event water with surface
   storage water transported by saturated overland Row has been suggested
   as an alternative mechanism to account for large volumes of pre-event
   water during saturated overland flow stormflow. In this paper we present
   results from various model simulations of groundwater-surface-water
   mixing in a headwater wetland. In the model we have varied both local
   and groundwater contributions to the wetland, precipitation intensity
   and the initial `wetness' of the wetland to better understand the
   processes controlling both stormflow and water chemistry. Surface water
   mixing is shown to be an important process during. low, moderate and
   high intensity events. Results from these simulations are used to
   predict the effect of reduced groundwater input to the wetlands on
   stormflow and water chemistry. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Shallow hillslope groundwater is shown to be a dominant source of
   streamflow in sloping bog-forest uplands of the North Coast Forest
   District, British Columbia, based on a three-component isotope
   hydrograph-separation analysis conducted in July 1998. At peak discharge
   during a mid-summer rainfall event, new water contributions accounted
   for only 12\% of streamflow, whereas shallow groundwater accounted For
   85\% of streamflow and bog groundwater and deep hillslope groundwater
   accounted for the remaining 3\% of streamflow. Mean residence time of

   roughly 400 mm based on the analysis of the baseflow discharge and

Abstract = {{Advances in space-time tools and techniques offer new possibilities to
   improve methods for exploratory data analysis and parameter estimation
   in regional flood frequency analysis (FFA). A general framework and
   methodological approach are proposed which integrate concepts and
   techniques of regional FFA, geostatistical theory and analytical
   geographical information systems (GIS) using data on climate,
   vegetation, geography and flood timing acid magnitude statistics.
   Non-parametric methods are used to act een data and to delineate
   homogeneous regions. Simulations are used to identify discordant sites,
   diagnose each region using the signal-to-noise ratio and lest regions
   for homogeneity based on L-moment ratios. Geostatistical measures of
   spatial autocorrelation are used to diagnose hierarchical spatial models
   for each L-moment ratio and to obtain map estimates of parameters using
   spatially explicit kriging techniques (analogous to regression). In
   addition to storing and displaying the spatio-temporal information
   accurately, the CIS is used to quantify spatial associations between
   dependent and independent variables and to diagnose homogeneous regions
   for further refinement using a simple spatial contrast measure.
   Analysis of data from central and eastern Canada (except the eastern
   parts of Newfoundland), encompassing a large area with significant
   random and systematic variability, demonstrates that: (i) map sets of
   L-mean and L-CV (coefficient of variation) for flood timing and
   magnitude can serve as indicators of climatic influences on the
   flood-generating mechanisms; (ii) models of spatial autocorrelation call
   be used to map point variables and their geostatistical spatial
   variance, which indicates whether maps are significant; and (iii)
   associations between L-CV and snow or vegetation could support improved
   mapping using co-kriging or geostatistical simulations. The map-based
   method provides parameter values at ungauged sites and maps of spatial
   variance that could support decisions to add or remove gauges from a
   hydrometric network. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the potential of using low-frequency climatic mode
   indices to forecast regional annual runoff in northern Quebec and the
   Labrador region. The impact of climatic trends in the forecast accuracy
   is investigated using a recurrent neural networks (RNN) approach,
   time-series of inflow to eight large hydropower systems in Quebec and
   Labrador, and indices of selected modes of climatic variability: El Nine
   Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO),
   Pacific-North American (PNA), Baffin Island-West Atlantic (BWA) and
   sea-level pressure (SLP) at Iceland. A wavelet analysis is used to show
   that the selected climatic patterns are related to annual runoff from
   1950 to 1996 in northern Quebec. The forecast results indicate that the
   use of BWA, PNA and ENSO indices results in better Forecast skill than
   the use of SLP or NAG. Overall, the use of the BWA index is found to
   provide the best forecast improvement (38\% on average), whereas the use
   of PNA provides 28\% of improvement on average. Using the SLP index
   improves the forecast accuracy by 4\% and the use of an ENSO indicator
   leads to an improvement of 6\%. The NAO index used here is found to
   provide only a modest improvement. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Spatial variability is recognized to exert a remarkable influence on the
   catchment hydrological response over a wide range of scales.
   Accordingly, one of the main advantages of distributed rainfall-runoff
   models is their capability of accounting For its effects, The
   application of these models. however, is often limited by the large
   amount of data required. Particularly, the spatial characterization of
   both the vegetation cover and soil type is needed in order to describe
   properly the spatial distribution of the soil infiltration properties.
   Lack of these data. which are often quite difficult to obtain in
   practice, is one of the reasons which may induce hydrologists to prefer
   the application of lumped models, despite their lower capability of
   describing hydrological processes. A possible way out for preserving the
   distributed nat are of the model is neglecting the spatial variability
   of the soil infiltration process by lumping the correspondent model
   parameters at the basin scale, and describing the transfer of runoff
   production at the basin outlet through a distributed approach. Lumping
   the infiltration parameters might be a reasonable assumption if one is
   interested in modelling those situations where the spatial variability
   of the infiltration process is expected to exert a marginal effect on
   the river discharge. Accordingly, the present analysis is aimed at
   verifying the effects of the spatial variability of the soil
   infiltration parameters on the flood flows modelled by a distributed
   model, with special reference to a case study of a river basin located
   in northern Italy. The main purpose of this work is to derive
   indications in order to possibly reduce the data requirements of
   distributed models, thus encouraging their application even in the case
   of limited data availability. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The Amazon basin covers an area of roughly 7 x 10(6) km(2) and
   encompasses diverse soil-landscape types with potentially differing
   hydrological behaviour. This study was conducted in the Ultisol
   landscape of the western Amazon basin in Peru. Processes of stormflow
   generation were investigated on an event basis in a first-order
   rainforest catchment to establish a causal link between soil physical
   and precipitation characteristics, hillslope flowpaths and stormflow
   hydrograph attributes. A sharp decrease in soil hydraulic conductivity
   with depth and high rainfall intensity and frequency favour rapid
   near-surface flowpaths, mainly in the form of saturation-excess overland
   flow and return flow. The latter results in an almost random occurrence
   of overland flow, with no obvious topographic control. Hillslope
   flowpaths do not vary much with respect to the hydrograph attributes
   time of rise, response time, lag time and centroid lag time. They have
   the same response time as streamflow, but a somewhat lower time of rise
   and significantly shorter lag times. The recession constant for
   hillslope hydrographs is about 10 min, in contrast to the streamflow
   recession constants of 28, 75 and 149 min. Stormflow generation in this
   Ultisol rainforest catchment differs strongly from that reported for
   Oxisol rainforest catchments. These two soilscapes may define a spectrum
   of possible catchment hydrological behaviour in the Amazon basin.

Abstract = {{Algal blooms frequently occur in the Maude Weir in the Murrumbidgee
   River of NSW, which are related to the availability of nutrients,
   particularly phosphorus. A clayey sediment from the bottom released P to
   the water when kept under reducing conditions, but did not release P
   when the supernatant water was aerated. The same material, with and
   without aeration, sorbed P when resuspended in water containing 1 mg P
   L-1. The resuspended anaerobic material adsorbed almost twice as much as
   the same material under aerobic conditions. Vigorous mixing, simulating
   transport breakage and abrasion, caused a substantial increase in
   sorption, with the effect being greater for the aerobic material. This
   was attributed to fragmentation of iron oxide aggregates formed during
   oxidation. Mineral magnetic properties, susceptibility and remanence
   ratios SIRM/chi SIRM/ ARM and IRMh\%, of the material from the
   desorption experiment reflected changes in the chemical state of iron
   caused by oxidation and reduction. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The magnetic properties of river sediments have been used to determine
   the sources of sediments. However, changes in magnetic properties during
   transport and sedimentation may occur. This paper examines the effect of
   reduction on the magnetic properties of sediments from the Maude Weir,
   NSW. For all sediment samples from the Maude Weir? for both cores and
   grab samples, there was an inverse relationship between particle size
   and concentration of magnetic minerals,as measured by magnetic
   susceptibility. The magnetic grain size, as measured by the ratio
   SIRM/chi, declined through the particle size range. This was attributed
   to dissolution of the finer grains of the magnetic minerals owing to the
   chemically reduced state of the sediments. As reducing conditions can
   alter both the concentration and magnetic grain size of sediments, it is
   important that the state of chemical reduction be considered when using
   mineral magnetism as a source tracer for dam sediments. There was a good
   relationship between total Fe and magnetic susceptibility and total
   phosphorus. The relationships mentioned above applied to all sediment
   samples and locations, even though there was substantial variation in
   the particle size distribution of the samples. Copyright (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{A hydrological model (SLURP) that was designed for simulating
   hydrological processes taking place in large river basins was: with
   minimal modification, used successfully to simulate water level
   variations over a 28-year period (1969-1996) for a 3-ha prairie wetland
   in Saskatchewan.
   The model calculates a water balance based on precipitation, snowmelt,
   evaporation, surface runoff and subsurface flow on a daily time-step.
   The model was first calibrated for two periods (1969-1973 for cropland
   and 1987-1990 for grassland), then it was applied to records outside the
   calibration periods. The model reproduced the wetland water level
   variations during a 28-year period with good accuracy. The wetland water
   levels were most sensitive to the infiltration coefficient of surface
   soil under frozen conditions and to maximum soil moisture storage. The
   applicability of the model and the calibrated parameters to a smaller
   wetland, with an area of 0.24 ha, was examined. This simulation
   indicated that scale effects are important, probably largely in relation
   to snow redistribution by wind. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The paper presents an attempt to determine the characteristics of karst
   aquifers using information on groundwater lever (GWL) in natural holes
   and boreholes with different data quantity and time resolution of GWL
   measurements. In this paper the particulars of karst aquifers were
   analysed for four examples from the Dinaric karst. In all four study
   areas, aquifers are formed in bare, deep and well-developed Dinaric
   karst consisting of Cretaceous limestones. The first example represents
   a wide area of Imotsko polje in the karst. The aquifer was analysed on
   the basis of infrequent water level monitoring in natural karst water
   features (jamas, lakes, wells) and discharges of springs and rivers. The
   karst aquifer in this example is complex, non-homogenous and variable in
   space and time, which is frequent in the Dinaric karst. Regardless of
   the aforementioned it was possible to determine its elementary
   characteristics. The second example represents 10 wells used for the
   water supply for the city of Pula. The GWL and salinity were measured
   once a week in the period between 1981 and 1996. Even though these
   measurements were relatively infrequent in space and time, they served
   as bases for assessment of average and maximum aquifer conditions as
   well as boundaries of saltwater intrusion. In the third example only a
   portion of aquifer of the karst spring Blaz, which is in the contact
   with the Adriatic Seas, has been analyzed. It is a spring with an
   intrusion of salt water. For purposes of study of saltwater intrusion,
   26 piezometers were drilled in its vicinity in which GWL, salinity and
   temperature were measured once a day during 168 days, a period
   comprising one complete cycle of seawater intrusion and retreat. These
   measurements proved the existence of dispersed discharge from the
   aquifer into the sea and its non-homogeneity in space. In the fourth
   example GWL was measured continuously in 10 deep (up to 300 m)
   piezometers in the hinterland of the Ombla Spring catchment. The
   measurement period lasted 2 years (January 1988 to December 1989). The
   analyses are made with hourly data. The results made it possible to
   determine numerous characteristics of the karst aquifer and a
   significant non-homogeneity of groundwater distribution in karst
   aquifers, depending more on the underground karst phenomena than the
   surface karst forms. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Streamwater nitrate (NO(3)(-)) concentrations along the main stream and
   at the outlet of several subcatchments within the 114.3 km(2) Zwalm
   watershed in Flanders, Belgium, have been monitored regularly since
   1991. Land use within the Zwalm catchment is predominantly agricultural,
   with forested regions in the south and urban concentrations in the
   north-east of the catchment. Streamwater NO(3)(-) concentrations
   increased with increases in stream discharge rates, but in general,
   discharge rate explained only about 30\% of the variation in NO(3)(-)
   concentrations. The low R(2) values were attributed to the observed
   anticlockwise hysteresis in the NO(3)(-) concentration-discharge
   relationship and to differences in NO(3)(-) concentrations between both
   seasonal flow and various flow regimes, with winter flow explaining 51\%
   of the variation in NO(3)(-) concentrations, whereas summer flow
   explained only 28\% of the variation. A hypothesis was formulated in
   which flow regime accounts for the seasonal variation in NO(3)(-)
   export, postulating that the catchment seasonally alternates between two
   hydrological stages. The first stage occurs during wet winter periods,
   when the catchment drains as a single source area, whereas the second
   stage occurs during dry summer periods, when the groundwater store
   disconnects into separate subcatchments. This causes NO(3)(-)
   concentration peaks to be more delayed during summer storm events
   compared with winter storm events. Regarding flow regimes, differences
   between high and low flow conditions and between increasing and
   stable/decreasing flow were not as pronounced a differences between
   seasons. In contrast to the estimation of NO(3)(-) concentrations,
   discharge was a strong predictor (R(2) = 0.71) of the NO(3)(-) flux
   within the tributaries of the Zwalm catchment. The NO(3)(-)
   concentrations in the main stream increased with decreasing elevation,
   whereas the seasonal concentration patterns along the main channel were
   similar to those observed at the outlet. NO(3)(-) concentrations varied
   considerably among catchments and showed a high variability over time,
   although in general, the variation in NO(3)(-) concentration was higher
   between catchments than within catchments. The impact of land use is
   clearly reflected in the streamwater NO(3)(-) concentrations, although
   NO(3)(-) concentration patterns were also affected by topography and, to
   a lesser extent, by soil type. A gradual increase in NO(3)(-)
   concentrations at the outlet of the Zwalm catchment could be observed
   throughout the 1991-1998 study period, providing evidence for the
   general trends of increase in Flanders, which are attributed to the
   intensification of agricultural activities. Copyright (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{Measurement uncertainty is a key hindrance to the quantification of
   water fluxes at all scales of investigation. Predictions of soil-water
   flux rely on accurate or representative measurements of hydraulic
   gradients and field-state hydraulic conductivity. We quantified the
   potential magnitude of errors associated with the parameters and
   variables used directly and indirectly within the Darcy-Buckingham
   soil-water-flux equation. These potential errors were applied to a field
   hydrometric data set collected from a forested hillslope in central
   Singapore, and their effect on flow pathway predictions was assessed.
   Potential errors in the hydraulic gradient calculations were small,
   approximately one order of magnitude less than the absolute magnitude of
   the hydraulic gradients. However, errors associated with field-state
   hydraulic conductivity derivation were very large. Borehole (Guelph
   permeameter) and core-based (Talsma ring: permeameter) techniques were
   used to measure field-saturated hydraulic conductivity. Measurements
   using these two approaches differed by up to 3.9 orders of magnitude,
   with the difference becoming increasingly marked within the B horizon.
   The sensitivity of the shape of the predicted unsaturated hydraulic
   conductivity curve to +/- 5\% moisture content error on the moisture
   release curve was also assessed. Applied moisture release curve error
   resulted in hydraulic conductivity predictions of less than +/- 0.2
   orders of magnitude deviation from the apparent conductivity. The flow
   pathways derived from the borehole saturated hydraulic conductivity
   approach suggested a dominant near-surface flow pathway, whereas
   pathways calculated from the core-based measurements indicated vertical
   percolation to depth. Direct tracer evidence supported the latter flow
   pathway, although tracer velocities were approximately two orders of
   magnitude smaller than the Darcy predictions. We conclude that saturated
   hydraulic conductivity is the critical hillslope hydrological parameter,
   and there is an urgent need to address the issues regarding its
   measurement further. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Two lumped conceptual hydrological models, namely tank and NAM and a
   neural network model are applied to flood forecasting in two river
   basins in Thailand, the Wichianburi on the Pasak River and the Tha Wang
   Pha on the Nan River using the flood forecasting procedure developed in
   this study. The tank and NAM models were calibrated and verified and
   found to give similar results. The results were found to improve
   significantly by coupling stochastic and deterministic models (tank and
   NAM) for updating forecast output. The neural network (NN) model was
   compared with the tank and NAM models. The NN model does not require
   knowledge of catchment characteristics and internal hydrological
   processes. The training process or calibration is relatively simple and
   less time consuming compared with the extensive calibration effort
   required by the tank and NAM models. The NN model gives good forecasts
   based on available rainfall; evaporation and runoff data. The black-box
   nature of the NN model and the need for selecting parameters based on
   trial and error or rule-of-thumb, however, characterizes its inherent
   weakness. The performance of the three models was evaluated
   statistically. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about solute transport in peats, despite the obvious
   importance of solute transport on ecohydrological processes in both
   managed and natural peatlands. To address this lack of knowledge, we
   investigated solute transport processes in an agricultural fen peat
   using a conservative KBr tracer. The main aim of the study was to
   elucidate solute transport behaviour in general in this peat, with a
   more specific aim of investigating whether preferential or bypassing
   flow occurred. The tracer moved through the peat more rapidly than
   expected, and the pattern of movement showed clear evidence of
   plot-scale bypassing flow. The data also provide evidence that bypassing
   flow occurs in pores at smaller scales. The implications of this study
   for management of wetland pastures in the Somerset Moors in south-west
   England are discussed. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of grid-cell size on calibrated parameters and on the
   performance of a variable source area model intended for urbanizing
   catchments is studied in this research. The model uses TOPMODEL concepts
   that were modified to consider urban areas in both the topographic index
   and the mechanism of surface runoff generation. The revised model known
   as TOPURBAN, was applied to a small catchment of roughly 8 km(2) in
   southern Ontario. Tell different grid-cell sizes ranging from 10 m to
   100 m were selected to study scale effects in this catchment with mild
   to moderate relief, on three separate time periods. The model performed
   adequately with calibration efficiencies for all three time periods in
   the range of 0.65 to 0.85. The verification efficiencies were not as
   high and ranged from 0.4 to 0.6. Larger cell sizes produced higher
   averages of topographic index, and this resulted in larger calibrated
   transmissivities. The most important parameter in determining the
   quantity of urban runoff was slightly affected by grid resolution.
   During the calibration process, this parameter was also found to
   interact with important parameters that dealt primarily with rural
   runoff generation. As cell size increased, contributions from urban
   areas increased and overland flow contributions from rural areas
   decreased. Results showed that in this integrated model of urban and
   rural areas, predicted processes based on calibrated parameters were
   dependent on grid resolution. Calibration of internal state variables is
   recommended to draw conclusions on the influences between urban and
   rural areas on the overall flow. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{We assess the relative merits of application of the most commonly used
   held methods (soil-water balance (SWB), chloride mass balance (CMB) and
   soil moisture monitoring (NP)) to determine recharge rates in
   microirrigated and non-irrigated areas of a semi-arid coastal orchard
   located in a relatively complex geological environment.
   Application of the CMB method to estimate recharge rates was difficult
   owing to the unusually high, variable soil-water chloride
   concentrations. In addition, contrary to that expected, the chloride
   concentration distribution at depths below the root zone in the
   non-irrigated soil profiles was greater than that in the irrigated
   profiles. The CMB method severely underestimated recharge rates in the
   non-irrigated areas when compared with the other methods. although the
   CMB method estimated recharge rates for the irrigated areas, that were
   similar to those from the other methods, ranging from 42 to 141 mm/year.
   The SWB method, constructed for a 15-year period, provided insight into
   the recharge process being driven by winter rains rather than summer
   irrigation and indicated an average rate of 75 mm/year and 164 mm/year
   for the 1984-98 and 1996-98 periods, respectively. Assuming similar
   soil-water holding capacity, these recharge rates applied to both
   irrigated and non-irrigated areas. Use of the long period of record was
   important because it encompassed both drought and heavy rainfall years.
   Successful application of the SWB method, however, required considerable
   additional held measurements of orchard ETc, soil-water holding capacity
   and estimation of rainfall interception-runoff losses.
   Continuous soil moisture monitoring (NP) was necessary to identify both
   daily and seasonal seepage processes to corroborate the other recharge
   estimates. Measured recharge rates during the 1996-1998 period in both
   the orchards and non-irrigated site averaged 180 mm/year. The pattern of
   soil profile drying during the summer irrigation season, followed by
   progressive wetting during the winter rainy season was observed in both
   irrigated and non-irrigated soil profiles, confirming that groundwater
   recharge was rainfall driven and that micro-irrigation did not
   `predispose' the soil profile to excess rainfall recharge. The ability
   to make this recharge assessment, however, depended on making multiple
   field measurements associated with all three methods, suggesting that
   any one should not be used alone. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{One of the key issues associated with the hypothesis of catastrophic
   subglacial drainage of the Livingstone Lake event is whether flows of
   such large magnitudes are physically feasible. To explore this issue, a
   one-dimensional hydraulic network flow model was developed to
   investigate the range of peak discharges and associated flow parameters
   that may have been carried by a tunnel channel network in south-east
   Alberta, Canada. This tunnel channel network has been interpreted
   elsewhere to carry large discharges associated with subglacial meltwater
   flows because of the convex longitudinal profiles of individual
   channels. This computational modelling effort draws upon established and
   verified engineering principles and methods in its application to the
   hydraulics of this problem. Consequently, it represents a unique and
   independent approach to investigating the subglacial meltwater
   hypothesis.
   Based on the modelling results, it was determined that energy losses
   resulting from friction limit the maximum peak discharge that can be
   transported through the tunnel channel network to 10(7) m(3) s(-1),
   which is in reasonable agreement with previous estimates of flood
   discharges for proposed meagfloods. Results show that flow through
   channels with convex longitudinal profiles occurs when hydraulic head
   exceeds 910 m (Lost River) and 950 m (Sage Creek), respectively. These
   are considerably below the maximum head capable of driving flow through
   the system of 1360 m, beyond which ice is decoupled from the bed across
   the pre-glacial drainage divide. Therefore, it is concluded that these
   model results support the hypothesis of catastrophic subglacial drainage
   during the Livingstone Lake event. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The Himalayan environment has, until recently, been perceived to be in a
   critical state of environmental decline, resulting From rapid population
   growth and associated land-use change. Recent research, however, has
   emphasized the difficulty of developing an objective appraisal of the
   state of the environment in a region where empirical data are scarce and
   unstructured and where an understanding of the spatial and temporal
   dynamics of natural environmental processes remains highly uncertain.
   This paper presents results from an intensive three-year project
   designed to help address the regional empirical deficit, establish
   detailed baseline environmental data and to gain an insight into storm
   period and seasonal suspended sediment dynamics. The instrumentation,
   calibration and analysis of high-frequency infrared turbidimetric
   records from a number of small subcatchments in the Nepal Middle Hills
   are reported. Storm period and seasonal Variation in turbidity and
   suspended sediment are examined and hysteresis patterns explored and
   explained. A variety of methods to estimate seasonal suspended sediment
   yield in a mixed land-use catchment are examined, and found to vary by
   up to a factor of five. Despite the inherent uncertainty, all estimates
   of catchment sediment yield are found to be high with respect to erosion
   plot studies from the local area, and this suggests the importance of
   riparian and channel erosion as major sediment sources. a finding
   consistent with other regional studies. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Complex hydrological events such as floods always appear to be
   multivariate events that are characterized by a few correlated
   variables. A complete understanding of these events needs to investigate
   joint probabilistic behaviours of these correlated variables. The
   lognormal distribution is one of frequently selected candidates for
   flood-frequency analysis. The multivariate lognormal distribution will
   serve as an important tool for analysing a multivariate flood episode.
   This article presents a procedure for using the bivariate lognormal
   distribution to describe the joint distributions of correlated flood
   peaks and volumes, and correlated flood volumes and durations. Joint
   distributions, conditional distributions, and the associated return
   periods of these random variables can be readily derived from their
   marginal distributions. The approach is verified using observed
   streamflow data from the Nord river basin, located in the Province of
   Quebec, Canada. The theoretical distributions show a good fit to
   observed ones. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Fine-grained (< 62.5 <mu>m) suspended sediment transport is a key
   component of the geochemical flux in most fluvial systems. The highly
   episodic nature of suspended sediment transport imposes a significant
   constraint on the design of sampling strategies aimed at characterizing
   the biogeochemical properties of such sediment. A simple sediment
   sampler, utilizing ambient flow to induce sedimentation by settling, is
   described. The sampler can be deployed unattended in small streams to
   collect time-integrated suspended sediment samples. In laboratory tests
   involving chemically dispersed sediment, the sampler collected a maximum
   of 71\% of the input sample mass. However, under natural conditions, the
   existence of composite particles or flocs can be expected to increase
   significantly the trapping efficiency. Field trials confirmed that the
   particle size composition and total carbon content of the sediment
   collected by the sampler were representative statistically of the
   ambient suspended sediment. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of laws on dam safety in France is briefly described. Most
   simulation studies for such problems are currently attempted using
   one-dimensional models, and we investigate here the possibility of
   moving to two-dimensional simulations. To date, these have been
   constrained by lack of available computational power. Parallel
   processing is an obvious solution, however, to date, an efficient
   parallel processing method that does not require major software recoding
   has proved elusive. Domain-decomposition is identified as being capable
   of overcoming these problems, as it allows pre-existing software to be
   adapted to run on clusters of supercomputer processors, workstations or
   PCs. The development of this new parallel method is outlined and its
   accuracy and efficiency tested in terms of the TELEMAC-2D model applied
   to the Malpasset dam break accident, which occurred in 1959 in the south
   of France. After a discussion of the data available, a sensitivity study
   is performed to evaluate some physical parameters in the equations,
   mainly the diffusion coefficient and the bottom friction. The friction
   appears to be the most important. A discrepancy of 3.4\% on the wave
   celerity is obtained between the model and field observations for a
   number of locations where the arrival time of the flood wave is
   perfectly known. The efficiency of different scalar and parallel
   machines is assessed. The study concludes that 2-D simulations of flood
   waves are already possible on domains with a length of some 10 s of
   kilometres. Larger domains (100 to 400 km) are also within reach with
   supercomputers, or with parallel architectures. Copyright (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{The past 20 years have seen a proliferation of numerical models in
   response to a need From governments, industry and researchers for tools
   that can simulate or predict environmental processes. Although this has
   led to significant scientific advances, in constructing such models code
   developers duplicate many basic tasks and functions. Ultimately
   therefore, the spread of progress is artificially restricted and the
   central focus of scientific activity may be misplaced. In this paper we
   examine the potential use of object-oriented programming techniques to
   overcome this problem and facilitate easy code reuse and maintenance in
   the face of rapid advances in numerical analysis research. In
   particular, we discuss the extent to which object oriented programming
   styles have an affinity for numerical environmental problems that
   traditional procedural programming styles do not share. We illustrate
   this through the development of one, two and three-dimensional finite
   element models for unsaturated groundwater flow using an object oriented
   environment developed originally for the solution of the Shallow Water
   equations. The complexity and quality of the solution that could be
   developed in a relatively limited period is demonstrated through
   comparison to three analytical test cases described in the literature.

Abstract = {{The TELEMAC system has been extended recently to deal with groundwater
   flow. In this paper we deal with subsurface contaminant transport
   applications of the TELEMAC system. Once released into groundwater,
   contaminants interact chemically with both the native water and the rock
   matrix. Interphase reaction such as sorption or precipitation are of
   primary interest because they considerably alter the contaminant
   mobility. Transport models frequently handle these interactions by using
   the partition coefficient (K-d) approach, assuming a constant ratio of
   sorbed and soluble contaminants. In the near-field of a nuclear waste
   repository chemical interactions need to be modelled more rigorously.
   This paper summarizes the conceptual model, the numerical techniques and
   the software architecture chosen for the development of a coupled
   hydrogeochemical model based on existing separated transport and
   chemistry modules. Some validation test cases, as well as a first
   application to the near-field of a nuclear waste repository, are also
   discussed. The TELEMAC system turns out to be a particularly convenient
   host for such multidisciplinary software. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley

Abstract = {{In multidimensional water quality modelling the spatial and temporal
   distributions of dissolved substances and suspended particles are
   simulated in order to account for inhomogeneities in the transport and
   reactive processes. The exchange processes at the water surface, e.g.
   photosynthesis and oxygen transfer, and at the water-sediment interface,
   e.g. erosion, deposition and oxygen transfer, are basically
   multidimensional, A homogeneous distribution can be expected only if the
   mixing processes generated by the hydrodynamics occur in a short time
   period compared with the reaction rates.
   This article presents sample results of a three-dimensional water
   quality model that includes the lake hydrodynamics, sedimentation and
   the proper representation of physical and reactive processes at the
   bottom and surface boundaries. The goal is to use this insight in order
   to obtain a better description of water quality with lower-dimensional
   models using spatial averaging techniques.
   For this purpose, the program TELEMAC-3D, which is able to calculate
   three-dimensional free surface flows and transport, was extended to
   include reactive processes. Ordinary differential equations remain to be
   solved following the solution of the non-reactive transport equations
   using operator-splitting techniques. These are in turn solved using a
   fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. As the reaction rates are in part
   considerably long compared with the hydrodynamics, a larger time-step is
   used for solving the transport equations.
   The model was applied to a lake in Berlin, Germany, the Grosser
   Muggelsee. Although comparatively shallow, it experiences extensive
   multidimensional hydrodynamics as a result of wind-induced currents and
   the Spree River, which flows through it. Numerous water quality
   measurements undertaken by the Institut fur Gewasserokologie und
   Binnenfischerei (IGB) demonstrate the influence of the hydrodynamics on
   the concentration distributions.
   A comparison between calculations with the spatial average of the 3-D
   model and directly calculated 0-D model results using the same
   reactive-kinetic formulations clearly demonstrates that the
   multidimensional effects, including the current distribution, have a
   significant effect on the water quality. Therefore, care must be taken
   to correctly include multidimensional effects for detailed assessment of
   possible remedial measures to improve the water quality. An averaging
   technique for including these effects is presented. Copyright (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The planned A89 motorway will go through the Dordogne-Isle confluence
   plain, which is regularly flooded under the effect of both river
   discharges and ocean tides. Hydraulic transparency of the motorway
   embankment was one of the prerequisites imposed by the French
   government. In order to optimize the cost/efficiency ratio of large
   culverts located under the motorway, their position and size had to be
   determined with great accuracy. This task has been fulfilled thanks to
   complementary sophisticated physical scale models and 2-D numerical
   models. The schematization principles adopted in the 2-D numerical model
   concerning bridge pier grouping were validated using the physical scale
   model.
   The finite element TELEMAC-2D code was used to draw up the optimum
   design of this river engineering scheme. TELEMAC-2D solves the 2-D
   Shallow Water equations on non-structured grids in the presence of
   alternately dry and wet beds. The 2-D numerical modelling based on high
   quality topographic data allows considerable improvements to be made in
   the computation of flood flows in a flat valley, as compared with
   traditional one-dimensional techniques. Near hood relief culverts in
   particular, the various physical effects contributing to the overall
   head loss can be distinguished: bottom roughness, medium size bed
   variations, strong curvature of the streamlines and vortices behind
   abutments.
   The hydraulic impact of the optimum solution has been studied under
   different aspects (rise of maximum flood levels, increase in maximum
   velocity, changes in the water flow patterns, submersion time of flooded
   land, modification of flood routing characteristics) for a wide range of
   flood hydrological events. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{During the 19th century oblique groynes were built in the bed of the
   Loire River, with the aim of channelling the river during low flow in
   order to maintain sufficient navigation conditions on a permanent basis.
   The longterm effect of these structures, in combination with massive
   sediment extraction over the past 50 years, has been to deepen the minor
   bed and aggrade old flood-prone areas. The goal of the present study was
   to restore the original flood conveyance properties of the river bed.
   The methodological approach combined refined flow modelling using the
   TELEMAC-2D program with traditional morphological expertise.
   Justifications for making this choice over alternative methods are
   given.
   Constraints and objectives for site correction were determined by
   multidisciplinary analysis. In particular, this included an
   environmental analysis aimed at preserving the area's fauna and flora
   and at restoring its former ecological diversity. The analysis also
   concerned the hydromorphological behaviour of the system. Proposals for
   site corrections are described. These essentially involved modifying the
   structures and dredging in order to recover flow conditions whereby the
   secondary branches of the river bed would be self-maintaining. The main
   objective of lowering flood levels was thus achieved, together with some
   restoration of the ecological diversity of the river system. The study
   was an opportunity to compare a now well-established method for I-D
   fluvial modelling with specific 2-D modelling aspects. It is an example
   of the progress that can be made by combining advanced modelling results
   with more traditional approaches. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{With the aim of evaluating the hydraulic risks connected with the
   construction of a new embankment at the confluence of the Magra River
   and the Bagnone Torrent, an experimental analysis was conducted using an
   undistorted 1 : 55 scale physical model. A parallel study using the
   software TELEMAC-2D applied to the same domain as the physical model and
   with the same boundary conditions was also carried out. The use of a
   numerical model enabled comparison of the results obtained from the
   physical model and a test of the reliability of the numerical model
   itself in terms of accuracy, stability and instability. In;order to
   estimate the effects induced by the construction of a new embankment,
   two sets of experiments were carried out; in the first set bed and bank
   topography before construction were modelled, and in the second set the
   actual situation with the embankment was considered. Comparison of data
   obtained from numerical simulations with measurements from the physical
   model showed a good agreement from a qualitative point of view. However,
   some differences were noticed in terms of local values, particularly in
   the bed morphology evolution where estimation of bed level variations
   are strongly dependent on the local sediment transport dynamics.

Abstract = {{Digital elevation models (DEMs) are becoming increasingly important
   tools in hydrological research and in water resources management. The
   quality of DEMs, however, normally is reported simply as the root mean
   square error of elevation, a statistic that fails to capture the
   numerous sources of error in DEMs or to predict their effect on the
   result of using the DEM. This paper presents a review of other
   approaches to assessing DEM quality, and argues that a full assessment
   of DEM quality must focus on the accuracy and reliability of the final
   product of the DEM analysis. A number of DEMs for the Slapton Ley
   catchments in Devon derived from digitized contour data are compared in
   an initial assessment of their suitability for use in hydrological work.
   Two are available for purchase from data suppliers, and five more were
   created using a variety of interpolation techniques in widely available
   geographical information system software. The different interpolation
   methods produce DEMs with different artefacts, although analyses of the
   distribution of elevation values, and visual techniques, suggested that
   none of these were of a particularly pronounced nature. The results of
   using the DEMs to derive drainage networks and catchment areas showed
   that at the broad scale there was a high level of agreement between the
   DEMs. There were, however, important differences of detail. For example,
   some DEMs predicted drainage lines that occasionally crossed the
   original contours. The results of calculating the TOPMODEL topographic
   index showed far more variation, because the index is calculated for
   each pixel in the area, rather than being an aggregate result derived
   from numerous pixels. The main conclusion was that care should always be
   taken to assess the quality of a DEM before attempting to use it, and
   that results should always be checked to ensure that they appear to be
   reasonable. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Balance fluxes have been calculated for the Greenland ice sheet using a
   two-dimensional finite difference scheme. They were calculated from a
   high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) and mass-balance data for
   the Greenland ice sheet. The method applied assumes that there is a
   balance between the net accumulation and the ice Aux at the margins and
   provides valuable information about the balance dynamics across the
   whole ice sheet.
   The balance fluxes, along with slope and slope direction information
   from the DEM were used in a geographical information system to delineate
   10 major drainage basins. Each drainage basin can be considered as an
   independent flow unit and thus the individual mass balance of each basin
   can be calculated independently. Further, the fluxes across the
   grounding lines of several major outlet glaciers in northern Greenland
   have been calculated, resulting in a reassessment of the mass balance of
   northern Greenland. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a partitioning method for the topographic surface, which is
   particularly suitable for hydrological distributed modelling and
   shallow-landslide distributed modelling. The model provides variable
   mesh size and appears to be a natural evolution of contour-based digital
   terrain models. The proposed method allows the drainage network to be
   derived from the contour lines. The single channels are calculated via a
   search for the steepest downslope lines. Then, for each network node,
   the contributing area is determined by means of a search for both
   steepest upslope and downslope lines. This leads to the basin being
   partitioned into physically based finite elements delimited by irregular
   polygons. In particular, the distributed computation of local
   geomorphological parameters (i.e. aspect, average slope and elevation,
   main stream length, concentration time, etc.) can be performed easily
   for each single element. The contributing area system, together with the
   information on the distribution of geomorphological parameters provide a
   useful tool for distributed hydrological modelling and simulation of
   environmental processes such as erosion, sediment transport and shallow
   landslides. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous investigations using various techniques have been carried out
   towards a more detailed understanding of relationships and interactions
   between catchment morphometry and rainfall-runoff processes. Recently,
   this research question has become more relevant through the need for
   accurate, yet simple, computer models simulating the water balance of
   large areas. Moreover, advances in the analysis of landform morphometry
   through the availability of high-resolution digital elevation models
   (DEMs) and powerful geographical information systems (GIS) have enhanced
   research efforts with this aim.
   In this study several computer techniques and models were applied to
   investigate the effects of geomorphometry on rainfall-runoff processes
   at different scales. The sensitivity of dynamic hydrological processes
   to comparatively static boundary conditions requires different methods
   for modelling, analysis and visualization of different kinds of data
   appropriate to different scales. Therefore an approach integrating
   several geocomputational concepts, including spatial analysis of
   different types of geodata, static modelling of spatial structures,
   dynamic four-dimensional modelling of hydrological processes and
   statistical techniques was chosen.
   Geomorphometric analysis of the study sites was carried out with GIS
   packages (including ARC/INFO and GRASS), special purpose software and
   self-developed tools. Soil-morphometry relationships were modelled
   within a GIS environment. Hydrological models (SAKE and TOPMODEL) were
   then used to simulate rainfall-runoff processes, and finally statistical
   tools and sensitivity analysis were applied to gain an insight into the
   hydrological significance of the various geomorphometric properties.
   The results demonstrate the importance of small subregions of the
   catchment, particularly those having low slope angles, low flow lengths
   and concavities. The spatial distribution of soil types significantly
   influences modelled runoff. Spatial distributions of soil types are
   partly related to morphometry and can be captured using soil-morphometry
   models. Further results show that catchments which differ significantly
   in morphometry show different runoff responses and different
   hydrological sensitivity to changes in boundary conditions. A crude
   derivation of geomorphometric-hydrological landform types could be
   reached. Therefore, geomorphometric classifications of catchment types
   could form a basis for representative hydrological modelling at the
   large scale. Models describing soil distribution in relation to
   geomorphometry could assist regionalization of spatial heterogeneity and
   structure of soil parameters relevant in hydrological modelling.
   Moreover, quantification of geomorphometric catchment structure, e.g. in
   terms of contributing areas, is needed to describe significant
   geomorphometric catchment characteristics. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Although many geographical information systems (GISs) are very advanced
   in data processing and display, current GIS are not capable of
   physically based modelling. Especially, simulating transport of water
   and pollutants through landscapes is a problem in a GIS environment. A
   number of specific routing methods are needed in a GIS for hydrologic
   modelling, amongst these are the numerical solutions of the Saint-Venant
   equations, such as the kinematic wave approximation for transport of
   surface water in a landscape. The PCRaster Spatial Modelling language is
   a GIS capable of dynamic modelling. It has been extended recently with a
   kinematic wave approximation simulation tool to allow for physically
   based water flow modelling. The LISFLOOD model is an example of a
   physically based model written using the PCRaster GIS environment. The
   LISFLOOD model simulates river discharge in a drainage basin as a
   function of spatial data on topography, soils and land cover. Although
   hydrological modelling capabilities have largely increased, there is
   still a need for development of other routing methods, such a diffusion
   wave. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{With geotechnical engineering the form of slope stability analysis most
   commonly used is the Bishop circular method. By assuming a circular
   shape, however, the method results in an overestimation of the factor of
   safety. This is because failure surfaces are often non-circular, given
   the heterogeneity of both hydrological and geotechnical slope
   characteristics. This problem is addressed by adapting an automated
   search algorithm for non-circular failure surfaces. The numerical method
   is based on a random search technique for the global minima of a
   constrained non-linear optimization problem. This is incorporated into a
   combined hydrology and stability model (CHASM) that allows the
   simulation of changes in pore-water pressures in response to individual
   rainfall events, and considers their role in maintaining slope
   stability. Initial results suggest that the implementation of the
   automated slip search algorithm leads to an improvement in the
   evaluation of slope stability in comparison to other less rigorous
   approaches. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reviews the problems of uncertainty in the definition of
   aquifer properties and the scale-dependence of dispersion with specific
   regard to well-capture zones. Stochastic methods have been developed in
   response to the problems of characterizing aquifer properties for
   contaminant transport modelling, as they provide a formal framework for
   the treatment of uncertainty. Their use for well-capture zone analysis,
   however, has been neglected so far. In this paper a stochastic numerical
   modelling procedure is presented, based on conditional geostatistical
   simulation of fine-scale aquifer structure, which is shown to reproduce
   stochastic analytical properties. The methodological approach is applied
   to the analysis of uncertainty in well-protection zones, and
   implications of the results for groundwater management are discussed.

Abstract = {{In the UK's upland catchments river terraces and alluvial features
   indicate a history of periodic aggradation and degradation linked to
   Holocene changes in land use (primarily deforestation) and climate
   change (altering flood frequency and magnitude). Although both factors
   are important, calculating their individual effects is complicated by
   the likelihood of their concurrent alteration.
   To investigate the relative impacts of land use and climate change, a
   cellular model is applied to the upland catchment of Cam Gill Beck,
   above Starbotton, North Yorkshire. This is divided into 1 million 2 m by
   2 m grid cells, to which a range of process laws are applied. These
   include approximate expressions for mass movement rates, soil creep, the
   influence of vegetation and hillslope hydrology, as well as fluvial
   erosion and deposition in ten grain-size fractions. This provides a good
   representation of valley floor geometry while retaining a fully dynamic
   interaction with the surrounding valley sides. Previous applications of
   this model have shown the detailed formation of bars and berms as well
   as examples of braiding, avulsion and channel change.
   Running on a Silicon Graphics Origin 2000 computer, an ensemble of
   simulations were completed, bracketing a wide range of environmental
   scenarios involving changes in flood frequency, magnitude and vegetation
   cover. Over time-scales ranging from 10 to 100 years, these showed that
   decreasing tree cover and increasing rainfall magnitude individually
   produced similar 25\% to 100\% increases in sediment discharge, whereas
   in combination they generated a 1300\% rise. Furthermore, channels
   formed by the model in response to increase rainfall magnitudes are
   located where relic channels are found in Cam Gill Beck, implying that
   these are the products of previous periods of high rainfall magnitudes.

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the representation of secondary circulation
   in river channel confluences. Recent research has emphasized the complex
   three-dimensional flow fields that exist where two river channels join.
   Field and laboratory measurements have been developed to describe
   time-averaged flow fields in terms of primary and secondary circulation,
   and to interpret these in terms of key generating processes. Central to
   this research is the need to understand the effect that flow structures
   have upon both mixing processes and confluence geomorphology, notably
   the development of scour-holes within the junction zone. One of the
   common problems faced by this research is the dependence of observed
   secondary flow structures upon the rotation plane for which they are
   determined. Different researchers have used different rotation planes,
   such that intercomparison of results from different field sites is
   difficult. Problems also arise when only two-dimensional measurements
   (e.g. downstream and cross-stream) are available, and vertical
   velocities need to be inferred from analysis of secondary circulation
   patterns. If different analytical methods produce different patterns, so
   different inferences could be reached. This paper uses a numerical model
   to show: (i) that different analytical methods do result in very
   different estimates of the strength of secondary circulation; (ii) that
   there are problems in inferring vertical velocities from secondary
   circulation cells identified using these methods in confluences. most
   notably as a result of the effects of planform acceleration and
   deceleration; and (iii) that field and laboratory measurements suffer
   from being unable to measure the three-dimensional flow field
   instantaneously, and hence allow understanding of the evolution of flow
   structures through time. A three-dimensional solution of the
   Navier-Stokes equations for open channel flow, combined with a free
   surface approximation and an unsteady turbulence model, allows
   representation of the three-dimensional time-averaged flow field, and
   some aspects of the unsteady evolution of these flow structures. Hence,
   the researcher can be freed from the dependence of results obtained upon
   the analytical method chosen. This emphasizes the downstream transport
   of mass in the form of a helix, which will be central in zones of how
   convergence or divergence, rather than the more traditional recognition
   of closed helical circulation cells. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Over the past 20 years numerical algorithm advances and increased
   computing power have led to the development of high-resolution
   hydrodynamic models for a variety of shallow-water flow problems.
   Despite the success of these approaches a number of fundamental
   constraints remain, in particular the simulation of flows that involve
   rapid changes in the position of the fluid boundary, for example river
   and coastal floods, tidal flows and dam breaks, is still extremely
   difficult. Given the relative difficulty of developing deformable
   meshing techniques that adapt to the flow evolution, most hydraulic
   models utilize a fixed-grid approach and use a correction algorithm for
   flow over partially wet elements. A range of techniques are available
   from simple grid-cell exclusion/inclusion methods to reformulation of
   the controlling hydrodynamic equations based on a knowledge of the
   subgrid topography. Although the latter approach retains the most
   realism, a number of problems with its implementation remain unresolved.
   These include the lack of a transparent sequence of numerical
   development and the need for a scheme that incorporates both mass and
   momentum corrections for partially wet elements. Moreover, in testing
   the scheme there is a clear requirement for a rigorous and objective
   test for such problems to be defined. In this paper a new subgrid-scale
   approach to dynamic wetting and drying in shallow water is therefore
   developed that overcomes these constraints. In particular a test case
   consisting of a sinusoidal tide on a planar beach is developed where
   water depths across the domain at each time-step are known independently
   of the model and compared with simulations conducted using both standard
   finite-element methods and the new technique. This comparison
   demonstrates that the new model gives a significant improvement in
   predicted hydraulics, particularly on the wetting phase. Moreover, it is
   shown that the new scheme applied to a low-resolution mesh outperforms
   standard methods solved using much higher resolution grids. The
   possibility is also raised that standard methods will always fail to
   capture wetting and drying processes adequately. This is critical as the
   simulations conducted show that the accurate capture of such
   hydrodynamic effects near the boundary has a significant impact on
   predictions over the entire domain. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{This paper outlines some computational and methodological issues arising
   from the application of a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model to the
   Blyth Estuary, Suffolk. The Blyth serves as a case study for a programme
   of research into the environmental dynamics of anthropogenically
   modified estuaries in south-east England. Central to this work is the
   implementation of hydrodynamic and sediment transport models to
   characterize the present process regime; support further studies of
   intertidal processes; and, ultimately, provide a basis for the
   investigation of joint management and environmental change scenarios.
   Two aspects of the hydrodynamic modelling are considered. First, the
   practicalities of modelling are explored, in terms of our ability to
   represent flow within a morphologically complex environment. Crucial
   issues include the quantity and quality of terrain data, the
   availability of software tools to permit their manipulation and
   interpolation on to computational meshes; and the ability of the model
   geometry to represent real world complexity, a feature of this study is
   the inclusion of a `pre-modelling' simulation intended to approximate
   the behaviour and properties of the intertidal parts of the
   computational mesh. MeshTool, a MATLAB-based Graphical User Interface
   (GUI) tool, has been developed to provide visualization and simulation
   facilities that greatly reduce the need for debugging of the mesh via
   repeated execution of the full hydrodynamic code. Second, the role of
   numerical modelling as a basis for geomorphological explanation is
   briefly explored. Physically based, high space-time resolution, models
   are of particular value where they facilitate a shift from `extensive'
   to `intensive' modes of research. Such a transition affords an increase
   in explanatory power: the emergent properties of physically based
   numerical simulations provide a more secure foundation for
   generalization, and the models themselves, through the `production of
   data', provide a framework for informing further research designs. As
   this study demonstrates, however, higher resolution terrain data and
   improved model representation of important processes operating at a
   subelement scale are required before this potential can be fully
   realized. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The modelling of water management scenarios and their impacts on the
   environment has to dale been undertaken using separate models and often
   by different organizations. The building and operation of a dam induces
   a chain of interlinked responses in the environment and to capture this
   in an impact assessment a more integrated approach to modelling is
   needed. The mixed spatial and temporal characteristics of the different
   variables mean that using a single model development environment is
   difficult. This paper shows how an integrated, hierarchically structured
   set of model components may be developed using an object-oriented
   modelling language linked with a geographical information system (GIS).
   This supports the representation of the process dynamics and the spatial
   complexity of the riverine environment. The method was applied to the
   Roadford Dam project on the River Wolf in south-west England. Water
   resource and water quality model components were developed in the
   object-oriented language and simulations were run for release regimes
   during the filling and operation of the dam for the years 1976, 1978,
   1986 and 1989, which represent respectively drought, normal, wet and dry
   conditions. The results, when compared with base-case conditions, showed
   the changes to the discharge, temperature, and chloride and nitrate-N
   ion values. The resulting flow values were an input to the third model
   component, that of the biotic system. These data were combined in a GIS
   with information on channel form and substrate, and known spawning and
   breeding sites of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Overlay analysis
   was used to determine the suitability of the new conditions for the
   species. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A geocomputational approach to the solution of applied spatial problems
   is being ushered in to take advantage of ever increasing computer power.
   The move is seen widely as a paradigm shift allowing better solutions to
   be found for old problems, solutions to be found for previously
   unsolvable problems and the development of new quantitative approaches
   to geography. This paper uses geocomputation to revisit point-pattern
   analysis as an objective, exploratory means of evaluating mapped
   distributions of landforms and/or events. A new variable resolution
   approach is introduced and tested alongside more traditional approaches
   of nearest neighbour distance and quadrat analysis and against another
   geocomputational approach, the K function. The results demonstrate that
   firstly, the geocomputational paradigm allows new and more useful
   solutions to be found for old problems. Secondly, a variable resolution
   approach to geographical data analysis goes some way towards overcoming
   the problem of scale inherent in such analyses. Finally, the technique
   facilitates spatiotemporal analyses of event data, such as landslides,
   thus offering new lines of enquiry in areas such as hazard mitigation,

   was assessed using global and storm-specific quantitative evaluation

Abstract = {{Soil erosion by overland flow, resulting from infiltration-excess
   rainfall, generates rill networks on hillslope areas. The way in which
   these networks emerge and develop suggests that hillslope erosion
   functions as a self-organizing dynamic system. Based upon this argument,
   a model for soil erosion (RillGrow 1) has been developed: this operates
   at the spatial scale of raindrops and microtopography. In this paper the
   second generation of the model (RillGrow 2) is described and applied to
   four different soil surfaces. Results suggest that, even at this early
   stage in its development, RillGrow 2 is capable of replicating the
   successes of the earlier model and in some cases of extending them. The
   success of both models suggests that this self-organizing view of rill
   generation may capture some fundamental aspects of the operation of real
   erosional systems. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Diffuse pollution is a significant and sometimes even major component of
   surface water pollution. Diffuse inputs of pollutants to the surface
   water are related to runoff of precipitation. This means that the
   analysis of diffuse pollutant fluxes from the land surface to the
   surface water requires an analysis of water fluxes. In this paper we
   have modelled the average long-term total runoff, groundwater recharge
   index and groundwater residence times for two large European river
   basins (Rhine and Elbe). We applied and compared two independently
   developed and recently published methods. We found that with the
   available large-scale databases and methods we could simulate
   successfuly the regional patterns of the average long-term total runoff.
   The reported groundwater recharge indices and groundwater residence
   times should be interpreted as estimates based on available knowledge
   and databases. They do not represent absolute values, but illustrate the
   possible travel times and spatial patterns of the different runoff
   components that have to be taken into account for the analysis of
   diffuse pollution at large regional and temporal scales. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{A stochastic model for synthetic data generation is not available in the
   literature for daily flows of intermittent streams. Such a model is
   required in the planning and operation of structures on an intermittent
   stream for purposes where short time flow fluctuations are important. In
   this study a model is developed for such a case. The model consists of
   four steps: determination of the days on which flow occurs,
   determination of the days on which a flow increment occurs,
   determination of the magnitude of the how increment, and calculation of
   the flow decrement on days when the flow is reduced. The first two steps
   are modelled by a three-state Markov chain. In the third step, how
   increments on the rising limb of the hydrograph are assumed to be gamma
   distributed. In the last step an exponential recession is used with two
   different coefficients. Parameters of the model are estimated from the
   observed daily streamflow data for each month of the year. The model is
   applied to a daily flow series of 35 years' length. It is seen that the
   model can preserve the short-term characteristics (the ascension and
   recession curves and peaks) of the hydrograph in addition to the
   long-term characteristics (mean, variance, skewness, lag-one and higher
   lag autocorrelation coefficients, and zero flow percentage). The number
   of parameters of the model can be decreased by fitting Fourier series to
   their annual variation. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Synchronous patterns of variation in NO(3) concentration, observed in
   upland lakes and streams across gradients of climate, altitude, land use
   and nitrogen deposition over the last decade, show a strong negative
   correlation with winter values for the North Atlantic Oscillation Index

   record validate this relationship, and although mechanisms are yet
   unclear, may be linked to the length of time the soil profile remains
   frozen during the winter. These findings are of particular significance
   to our understanding of the relationship between atmospheric N
   deposition and concentrations and fluxes of NO(3) in runoff, and the
   potential response to future climatic changes. Copyright (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{This study examined the spatial and temporal variability of throughflow
   in a shallow forest soil in terms of the controls exerted by topography,
   soil properties and the shape of the water table. Hillslope outflow was
   measured at nine troughs installed at a road cut, and hydraulic head was
   measured at 37 piezometers installed to the confining till surface at
   the base of the soil. At the lowest flows, the distribution of
   throughflow across the hillslope conformed reasonably to the
   distribution of upslope contributing area computed from the topography
   of the confining basal till layer. At higher flows, however, the
   distribution of throughflow shifted, partly as a result of changes in
   the orientation in how tubes as the piezometric surface changed. At high
   flows, surface topography appeared to provide a reasonable proxy for the
   shape of the water table. Shunting of water through discrete macropores,
   however, can apparently overwhelm topographic controls on throughflow,
   at least for slope widths less than about 10 m. Effective hydraulic
   conductivities computed at the scale of the troughs varied over two
   orders of magnitude and displayed no consistent relationship with the
   thickness of the saturated layer. Estimates at the plot scale (c. 10 m
   hillslope width) were far less variable, and for higher flows displayed
   an approximately linear relationship with saturated zone thickness.

Abstract = {{The hydrochemistry of naled and upwelling water sampled from the
   forefields of Finsterwalderbreen, Svalbard, during spring are used for
   the first time to infer the hydrology of overwinter meltwaters at a
   polythermal-based glacier. Hydrochemical variations in naled are
   explained in terms of different water sources and their chemical
   alteration during freezing. Two water sources to naled are identified:
   surficially rented snowmelt and subglacial water. Naled that results
   from the freezing of the former is enriched in atmospherically derived
   ions such as Na+ and Cl-, and is believed to be formed during winter
   warm periods. Naled of subglacial origin contains relatively high
   proportions of crustally derived solute. It reflects the freezing of
   subglacial meltwaters that continue to issue from a subterranean
   upwelling during winter. An increasing dominance of SO42- Mg2+, Na+ and
   Cl- in subglacial naled with increasing distance from the upwelling
   reflects the progressive freezing of this water body and the. associated
   removal of Ca2+ and HCO3- by calcite precipitation. These spatial trends
   are accentuated by the leaching of soluble ions from the naled close to
   its source by subsequent upwelling waters. The chemistry of spring
   upwelling waters, also of subglacial origin, strongly reflects this
   process, Meltwater produced by geothermal heating of glacier basal ice
   is believed to be the principal source of water to the subglacial
   drainage system during winter. Solute acquisition by this meltwater is
   limited by a scarcity of proton suppliers. Evolution of this dilute
   meltwater carries an imprint of ion exchange processes. Some stored
   subglacial water from the end of the previous ablation season may
   supplement the basal meltwater component in early winter. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were measured and exports were
   calculated in the subtropical Richmond River catchment between July 1994
   and June 1996. A stratified sampling approach was adopted owing to the
   extreme and rapid changes in riverine discharge, which varied by up to
   10 000 times over the study period. Nutrient concentrations were lowest
   during baseflow. During storm discharge, dissolved inorganic and organic
   and particulate nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations increased two- to
   five fold, and followed hysteresis patterns that were attributed to the
   integration and/or depletion of catchment nutrient sources during an
   event. Dissolved organic nitrogen and particulate phosphorus were the
   dominant nutrient forms. Land use and antecedent conditions had a large
   influence on nutrient concentrations and exports. During the 1995-96
   year (slightly above the mean annual discharge) 96\% of nitrogen and
   98\% of phosphorus loads were transported in less than 6\% of the time.
   When averaged across the catchment, monthly riverine nutrient loads
   varied by up to 1061-fold during the study and exports were
   approximately four-fold greater during the second year relative to the
   first. The subtropical Richmond River catchment has greater intra- and
   potential interannual variability in nutrient loads and exports when
   compared with temperate catchments from other parts of the world. It is
   suggested that in tropical and subtropical Australian catchments with
   large intra- and interannual variation in discharge, the need for
   parameterizing the antecedent conditions, such as the degree of nutrient
   storage, may make it difficult to model spatial and temporal (short
   time-scale) nutrient exports. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{During past decades, a diverse system of subsistence agriculture in
   south-east Spain (annual rainfall of less than 300 mm) has been
   overturned in favour of large-scale plantations of almond trees without
   consideration for topography and related spatial patterns in soil
   hydrological properties. The objective of this paper is to investigate
   the spatial pattern in soil physical properties induced by this
   cultivation system, and to highlight its impacts on the water balance.
   Soil properties were recorded along hillslopes with shallow soils
   developed on slates and greywackes in the upper part of the Guadalentin
   drainage basin (Murcia region). Frequent tillage of these almond
   plantations covering entire hillslopes has resulted in denudation by
   tillage erosion on the topographic convexities, as well as transport of
   rock fragments and fine earth along the slopes. These processes have
   created a systematic spatial pattern of soil thickness and rock fragment
   content: shallow and stony soils on the topographic convexities and deep
   soils with a rock fragment mulch in the concavities at the foot of the
   slopes. At the same time, a negative relationship between rock fragment
   content and fine earth bulk density was observed. The impact of this
   spatial pattern in soil properties on the water balance was evaluated
   using the PATTERN one-dimensional hydrological and plant growth model,
   The model simulates the water balance of soil profiles covering the
   observed variation in soil thickness, stoniness and bulk density. The
   model results indicate that the highest rates of infiltration,
   evaporation and drainage, as well as the lowest rates of overland flow
   are restricted to shallow soils on the hilltops. In contrast, the deeper
   soils in the valley bottoms produce a more stable moisture regime than
   shallower soils, which tend to saturate and dry out quickly. These model
   results are in agreement with the spatial patterns of almond
   productivity: an asymptotic increase with soil thickness. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{In this study, laboratory rainfall simulation in an extensive area was
   used to study the infiltration, and interception and storage from
   surface runoff in points with different stone cover percentages (0, 10,
   20 and 30\%) and slopes (5 degrees, 10 degrees and 20 degrees). The
   experimental results of this study showed that the interrelationships
   among the slope, stone cover percentage, groundwater level, surface
   runoff amount, and interception and storage of the ponds were varied and
   irregular. No systematic patterns were detected for the change in the
   groundwater level, surface runoff amount, and interception and storage
   of the ponds with different stone cover percentages at different slopes
   and no threshold values were apparent. For a 5 degrees slope, if the
   stone cover percentage was increased, the amount of surface runoff was
   reduced, the infiltration and the groundwater level experienced no
   significant change, and the interception and storage of the ponds
   increased. For a 10 degrees slope, if the stone cover percentage was
   increased, the amount of surface runoff increased, the infiltration
   decreased, the groundwater level experienced no significant change or
   decreased slightly at certain points, and the interception and storage
   of the ponds increased. For a 20 degrees slope, if the stone cover
   percentage was increased, the amount of surface runoff increased, the
   infiltration decreased, the groundwater level experienced no significant
   change or decreased slightly at certain points, and the interception and
   storage of the ponds increased. With or without stone cover, when the
   hydraulic conductivity of the top material is close to that of fine sand
   or laterite, an increase in the slope gradient decreased the amount of
   surface runoff and increased the storage amount of the ponds. As for the
   stone distribution, an interlaced style showed better performance in the
   interception and storage of ponds than that of a regular style. There
   was no significant change in the groundwater level. Copyright (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Hydrological processes in high altitude mountainous regions differ from
   those in more temperate regions, primarily due to such influences as
   cold temperatures, large and rapid change in surface energy balance
   during snowmelt, a long period at low-temperature environmental
   condition and the existence of permafrost. A physically based,
   semi-distributed water balance model to quantitatively simulate the
   hydrological processes and stream flow, as well as to estimate the
   potential consequences of projected global warming on stream Row for
   such high altitude mountainous regions was constructed. Distributed
   meteorological data from the interpolation of the point measurements by
   means of a digital elevation model (DEM) of the basin, such as air
   temperature, precipitation, snowfall ratio, wind speed, etc., have been
   used as model input. Several other hydrological parameters, such as soil
   moisture content and evapotranspiration, which are essential in
   simulation of river runoff in a water balance state, were estimated by
   the combination of Landsat TM and a DEM with the utilization of the
   distributed meteorological data. The model uses only a few crucial
   parameters for calibration, and the model structure is based upon
   estimating the stream flow components. Simulated results of spatially
   distributed soil moisture content, evapotranspiration and monthly
   discharge yield reasonable agreement, both spatially and temporally, to
   the field observations or the estimated results by the other approaches.
   This physically based model has the potential to project stream flow
   under the possible climate scenarios. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Empirical characteristics of snowmelt runoff are derived from
   observations made during snowmelt in a six-year period from 1980 to 1985
   on three experimental plots and three plates located on the campus of
   the Lulea University of Technology in Lulea, Sweden. The plots had
   asphalt, gravel and grass surfaces. The plates were of different designs
   with one having the bottom cut out so that it was more like a frame.
   With the assumption that the asphalt surface of the plots was
   impervious, infiltration of meltwater into gravel and grass surfaces was
   deduced. Unlike rainfall infiltration, the graph of snowmelt
   infiltration rate resembled a flow hydrograph, with a distinct rise, a
   peak and a distinct recession. A strong linear relationship between the
   snowmelt runoff hydrograph peak and the snowmelt amount was found, which
   explained more than 90\% of the variability in the snowmelt peak. This
   is in contrast with rainfall runoff where the relationship between
   runoff peak and volume is decidedly nonlinear. Hourly snowmelt runoff
   peak and daily snowmelt amount were found to exhibit nearly constant
   skew and follow approximately a Gumbel frequency distribution. Copyright

Abstract = {{A large weighing lysimeter was installed at Yucheng Comprehensive
   Experimental Station, north China, for evapotranspiration and
   soil-water-groundwater exchanges studies. Features of the lysimeter
   include the following: (i) mass resolution equivalent to 0.016 min of
   water to accurately and simultaneously determine hourly
   evapotranspiration, surface evaporation and groundwater recharge; (ii) a
   surface area of 3.14 m(2) and a soil profile depth of 5.0 m to permit
   normal plant development, soil-water extraction, soil-water-groundwater
   exchanges, and fluctuations of groundwater level; (iii) a special
   supply-drainage system to simulate field conditions of groundwater
   within the lysimeter; (iv) a soil mass of about 30 Mg, including both
   unsaturated and saturated loam. The soil consists mainly of mealy sand
   and light loam. Monitoring the vegetated lysimeter during the growing
   period of winter wheat, from October 1998 through to June 1999,
   indicated that during the period groundwater evaporation contributed
   16.6\% of total evapotranspiration for a water-table depth from 1.6 m to
   2.4 m below ground surface. Too much irrigation reduced the amount of
   upward water flow from the groundwater table, and caused deep
   percolation to the groundwater. Data from neutron probe acid
   tensiometers suggest that soil-water-content profiles and
   soil-water-potential profiles were strongly affected by shallow
   groundwater. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Canadian research contributions to quantity, quality and ecology of
   surface waters during 1995-1998 (182 items) are summarized under six
   headings: understanding the pristine hydrological system (49); climate
   variability and hydrological systems (23); streamflow data, modelling
   and simulation (23); regional, international and flood hydrology (31);
   land use effects on the hydrological system (35); and sustainability of
   hydrological systems (21). The most encouraging developments have
   occurred in increased understanding of the inter-connectedness of
   components of the hydrological cycle and, especially, of the links
   between biosphere and hydrosphere. Canadian hydrologists also have
   played a significant role in global environmental change research and in
   applied development research. The most discouraging development has been
   the collapse of the national water monitoring programme and the decay of
   integrated experimental research areas. The overall impression is that
   hydrology in Canada is a maturing discipline; the physical, chemical and
   biological components are becoming less isolated; and anthropogenic
   impacts on surface water are more frequently considered to fall within
   the purview of hydrological science. The role of hydrology in relation
   to sustainability is increasingly actively debated. Copyright (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Approximately 42\% of Canada is covered by forests, which in turn can be
   subdivided into nine distinct forest ecozones. Many forested ecozones
   are located in northern Canada, where cold winters and cool summers
   provide forest environments that are less well-understood that those in
   more temperate locations. A number of major developments in recent years
   have stressed the need for enhanced understanding of hydrological
   processes in these forest landscapes. These include an increased
   emphasis on sustainable forest management in Canada as well as major
   scientific initiatives (e.g. BOREAS) examining water, carbon and energy
   fluxes in forest ecosystems, with a particular focus on boreal and
   subarctic forests. Recent progress in our understanding of forest
   hydrology across Canada is reviewed. Studies of hydrological processes
   across the spectrum of forest ecozones are highlighted, as well as work
   on hydrological responses to forest disturbance and recovery. Links
   between studies of hydrological processes in Canada's forests and other
   fields of research are examined, with particular attention paid to
   ongoing efforts to model hydrological impacts and interactions with the
   climate, biogeochemistry, geomorphology and ecology of forested
   landscapes. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Wetlands comprise 14\% of the land area of Canada. They have
   considerable impact on water storage and runoff, water quality,
   atmospheric exchanges of carbon, and important elements such as
   nitrogen. In less remote parts of Canada, wetlands have suffered from
   reclamation, exploitation, contamination and degradation, which have
   seriously impaired their ecological function. Public recognition of
   their environmental significance has highlighted the need for a better
   understanding of the hydrological processes, to better plan and manage
   wetland areas, restore degraded systems, and predict responses to global
   change. This paper reviews current hydrological research in all types of
   Canadian wetlands. The scope of hydrological processes discussed herein
   includes runoff, surface and groundwater flows, evaporation,
   microclimate, water balance, geochemical and solute transport
   phenomenon, carbon dynamics, isotope studies, exploitation and
   restoration. Field, laboratory and modelling studies are included.

Abstract = {{This paper provides an overview of Canadian research on snow, frozen
   soils and permafrost hydrology during the years 1995-98. There were
   significant advances in the understanding of processes and the
   development of models of snow accumulation and melt, including the
   relocation of snow by wind, snow interception in forest canopies,
   sublimation and energy balance during snowmelt. A major aspect was the
   development of physically based predictive techniques that account for
   the effects of heterogeneous topography, vegetation and snow properties,
   and complex boundary-layer development on snow accumulation,
   evaporation, melt and runoff. Another advancement is in the linkage of
   physical snow processes with chemical models to better describe ion
   accumulation and elution from snow. Snow ecology has shown the
   interactions in nutrient cycles that involve snow. Frozen ground
   research has resulted in significantly improved models of frozen soil
   infiltration, based on both field observations and thermodynamic
   principles. Research in permafrost regions includes the exfiltration of
   groundwater in the seasonally thawed zone and the occurrence of
   perennial springs discharged from below the permafrost. Groundwater
   discharge is important to features such as icings and the occurrence of
   wetlands in a polar desert. Processes governing runoff generation on
   hillslopes have been examined, both in continuous and discontinuous
   permafrost zones. In terms of future research directions, consideration
   should be given to continued intensive field studies of cold region
   hydrological processes and the incorporation of these processes into
   aquatic chemistry and hydrological models and land surface schemes used
   in atmospheric models. A better understanding of the role of
   hydrological boundaries in affecting the rates of processes is needed.
   The question of scaling processes up from the small scale at which they
   are relatively well understood, to the larger scales necessary to
   address global environmental concerns also should be addressed.

Abstract = {{River ice is present in nearly all Canadian rivers, for periods ranging
   from days to many months. Whether moving or stationary, it interacts
   with the river flow in various ways, resulting in multiple impacts on
   the economy and ecosystem, and posing a major flood threat to riverside
   communities. In the past 4 years, Canadian research and development
   efforts have been directed at a variety of problems. A strong focus on
   ice breakup and ice jam processes resulted in improved understanding of
   the salient geomorphological and hydroclimatic factors, enhanced
   modelling and prediction capabilities, and development of techniques for
   in situ measurement of ice jam properties. Key contributions in the area
   of ecological impacts of river ice and ice jams have led not only to
   solid advances in knowledge, but also to an appreciation of the vast
   scope of this subject and its numerous links to environmental science. A
   closely related topic, the flux of suspended sediment in ice-laden
   rivers was studied for the first time, in order to delineate the effects
   of the ice on sediment and associated contaminant loads. In response to
   growing concern about climate change and variability, several studies
   addressed implications to ice regime, and thence, to ecology and
   economy. Although not fully explored, the potential impacts appear to be
   numerous and significant, owing to the high sensitivity of river ice
   processes to climatic factors. In the foreseeable future, research is
   likely to continue along the above noted lines, although an increased
   emphasis on climatic and ecological aspects is probable. Insights gained
   on the mechanisms of breakup and jamming may lead to increased modelling
   applications and testing of theoretical concepts. Copyright (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Glacier variations are Signals of global change. Current estimates are
   that ice is being lost from small glaciers of the world at the rate of
   approximately 130 mm year(-1) and that the impact of this alone would be
   to change sea level upward, by 0.25 mm year(-1). The reductions in small
   glacier ice volume over the past century, which exceed 50\% in many
   areas, are likely to significantly change freshwater resources and
   wildlife habitat on land. Progress in three areas is crucial to
   understanding the links between glacier variations and the changes which
   may occur: (i) the development of a comprehensive mass balance
   assessment network; (ii) the knowledge of how winter weather determines
   snow accumulation; acid (iii) the processes of surface meltwater
   production and development of the internal hydrology that links melt to
   water yield from local streams. Almost 20\% of the mass balance records
   that exceed a 20-year time period come from Canada, but this does not
   signify the existence of a comprehensive network, particularly in view
   of the substantial loss of measurement sites that has occurred over the
   past 20 years. Snow accumulation is still understood mainly in terms of
   mass balance data that are gathered at the end of winter, but
   contributions by Canadian scientists to improving precipitation gauge
   accuracy, and the installation of automatic weather stations at glacier
   sites, offer the prospect of connecting the daily weather to the
   accumulation regime. The greatest progress has been made in relating
   summer ablation to glacier hydrology, such that Canadian scientists, in
   league with others, are now mapping the surface energy input over
   glacier surfaces and showing how meltwater generated from the energy
   passes through the internal hydrological system of the glacier to its
   snout. Although meltwater hydrology should continue to be a strong area
   of research, there is a need to bring knowledge about the accumulation
   regime up to par with that of the ablation regime and to improve the
   mass balance assessment network. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The potential of remote sensing for providing information to
   hydrologists and water resources practitioners has been recognized since
   the 1970s. The variety of satellite and airborne platforms and the
   greater ease of access to imagery now make it possible to evaluate and
   quantify an increasingly large number of watershed physical
   characteristics and state variables. Canadian scientists have been very
   active over the last 5 years creating algorithms to extract hydrological
   information from remotely sensed data and to develop new, or adapt
   existing, hydrological methods capable of making efficient use of this
   new information. Over the years, research and applications of remote
   sensing in Canadian hydrology have embraced a variety of topics and
   recent research has placed significant emphasis on radar remote sensing
   as the Canadian RADARSAT satellite was launched successfully on 4
   November 1995. This paper reviews recent (1995-99) remote sensing
   contributions in hydrology by Canadians, specifically focusing on the
   usefulness and applicability of current remote sensing technology for
   water management purposes. A very brief description of the theory
   underlying each application as well as relevant sensors is presented.

Abstract = {{This paper reports some of the achievements in hydrological research
   associated with the Mackenzie GEWEX Study (MAGS). MAGS is a multifaceted
   study of the energy and water cycle in the Mackenzie River Basin,
   north-western Canada, and emphasizes cold-region processes and
   modelling. It pursues methodologies of scaling-up process studies to a
   large river basin that has few measurement sites. This methodology
   involves new developments, adapting mid-latitude algorithms to the high
   latitude setting and promoting the use of remote sensing tools for
   scaling-up. Intensive hydrological process studies have been
   concentrated at a number of sites. These have been chosen to represent
   different biophysical facets of the Mackenzie River Basin. They include
   northern basins in open tundra and at tree-line, a western basin
   representing the hilly and mountainous western side of the basin,
   central basin sites of wetlands, Precambrian Shield terrain and the
   Mackenzie Basin counterpart of the large Laurentian Great Lakes. The
   most southerly site represents a mixed-wood boreal forest site that is
   undergoing land-use change as a result of forest harvesting. Regional
   community model analysis indicates that processes of lee cyclogenesis
   result in differential input of precipitation across the basin.
   Significant results centre on models of snow accumulation featuring the
   role of blowing snow, intercepted snow and snowmelt. These models
   emphasize the importance of snow patchiness to speed of melt. Snowmelt
   infiltration into frozen soils is important in controlling runoff, and
   tundra microlandforms play a unique role in determining the surface
   runoff characteristics. On the western margins of the basin, there is a
   very significant difference in the hydrological behaviour of slopes of
   different aspects as a result of differences in permafrost and
   vegetation. In the central basin, a deeper understanding of components
   of the water budget is being gained through stable isotope analysis of
   wetland waters. The importance of wetland-controlled spring flow, and
   its impact on spring breakup characteristics on the Mackenzie River, is
   being explored. A quite unique influence of Precambrian Shield terrain
   on the water balance results from the large storage capacity of deep
   bedrock fissures. They can substantially delay streamflow response to
   snowmelt. The large lakes of the Mackenzie Basin echo, only in part, the
   behaviour of the Laurentian Great Lakes. A surprising and rapid response
   of evaporation to warming during the 1998 El Nino warming episode
   occurred, which could serve as a surrogate for warming resulting from
   climate change. In the southern and central forested parts of the basin,
   vegetation types play a substantial role in the water balance,
   particularly in influencing interception and subsequent sublimation
   during winter. The latter is an important component of the water balance
   and a major cold-region process, the modelling of which is an important
   achievement of MAGS. Remote sensing provides passive microwave satellite
   data to help identify snow-water characteristics and calculate the
   break-up and freeze-up dates of the Mackenzie great lakes, and AVHRR
   data to help develop algorithms for evapotranspiration modelling, and to
   use in calculating the surface solar radiation budget on a basin scale.
   Ongoing research is successfully integrating a GCM model land-surface
   scheme, regional community climate model and hydrological model to
   simulate the water balance of sub-basins and of the total Mackenzie
   River Basin system. Expected achievements at the end of MAGS Phase 1 are
   outlined and some goals for future MAGS research are discussed.

Abstract = {{Canadian research on contemporary erosion and sedimentation processes
   covers a wide range of scales, processes, approaches and environmental
   problems. This review of recent research focuses on the themes of
   sediment yield, land-use impact, fine-sediment transport, bed material
   transport and river morphology and numerical modelling of fluvial
   landscape development.
   Research on sediment yield and denudation has confirmed that Canadian
   rivers are often dominated by riparian sediment sources. Studies of the
   effects of forestry on erosion, in-stream sedimentation and habitat are
   prominent, including major field experimental studies in coastal and
   central British Columbia. Studies of fine-sediment transport mechanisms
   have focused on the composition of particles and the dynamics of
   flocculation. In fluvial dynamics there have been important
   contributions to problems of turbulence-scale flow structure and
   entrainment processes, and the characteristics of bedload transport in
   gravel-bed rivers. Although much of the work has been empirical and
   field-based, results of numerical modelling of denudational processes
   and landscape development also have begun to appear.
   The nature of research in Canada is driven by the progress of the
   science internationally, but also by the nature of the Canadian
   landscape, its history and resource exploitation. Yet knowledge of
   Canadian rivers is still limited, and problems of, for example, large
   pristine rivers or rivers in cold climates, remain unexplored. Research
   on larger scale issues of sediment transfer or the effects of
   hydrological change is now hampered by reductions in national monitoring
   programmes. This also will make it difficult to test theory and assess
   modelling results. Monitoring has been replaced by project- and
   issues-based research, which has yielded some valuable information on
   river system processes and opened opportunities for fluvial scientists.
   However, future contributions will depend on our ability to continue
   with fundamental fluvial science while fulfilling the management agenda.

Abstract = {{The stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen incorporated in the water
   molecule (O-18 and H-2) have become an important tool not only in
   Isotope Hydrology, routinely applied to study the origin and dynamics of
   surface and groundwaters, but also in studies related to atmospheric
   circulation and palaeoclimatic investigations. A proper understanding of
   the behaviour of these tracers in the water cycle is required for a
   meaningful use of these tools in any of these disciplines. Our knowledge
   of the vertical distribution and the factors controlling the stable
   isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen in atmospheric moisture derives
   from a limited number of observations and vertical profiles in the
   atmosphere. An international programme jointly operated by the
   International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the World Meteorological
   Organization (WMO), and operational since 1961, has resulted in the
   development of a dedicated database to monitor isotope ratios in
   precipitation in more than 500 meteorological stations world-wide. The
   main features of the spatial and temporal variations of stable isotope
   ratios of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation and atmospheric moisture
   at the global scale are presented based on the analysis of limited data
   on water vapour, data obtained by the Global Network for Isotopes in
   Precipitation (GNIP) and the few observations at high latitudes.

Abstract = {{The isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture is determined foremost
   by the isotope fractionation that accompanies the evaporation occurring
   over the oceans. This subsequently is modified by rainout on the one
   hand, and on the other hand by the recycling of precipitation into the
   atmosphere as a result of evapotranspiration from the continents or from
   droplets beneath the cloud base. The marine part of the atmospheric
   water cycle is described by the model of Craig and Gordon, showing the
   d-excess value to reflect the humidity gradient from the saturated
   vapour over the sea (a function of both temperature and salinity) to the
   ambient humidity. Average conditions correspond to a value of d = 10\%.
   However, on the leeside of continents and over the Mediterranean Sea,
   where the humidity deficit in the dry and cold air is large, higher
   values of up to d = 30\% are engendered. Similar results are found when
   the evaporated vapour from lakes and other open water bodies mixes into
   the atmosphere. A model enabling the quantitative evaluation of the
   contribution of the evaporation flux to atmospheric humidity is
   exemplified by the case of the North American Great Lakes. A regional
   atmospheric water balance model, based on the isotopic composition of
   runoff and precipitation is presented for the Amazon basin. Copyright

Abstract = {{Natural variations of the stable isotopes oxygen-18 and deuterium in
   lakes and seas can be used in studies of their hydrological regime and
   hydroclimatic changes of their environment, as demonstrated by recent
   Caspian Sea isotopic investigations. Practical applications of this
   technique are often hampered by difficulties inherent in the
   determination of parameters defining the isotopic enrichment during the
   evaporation of the lake/sea surface water. Conventional evaporation pan
   experiments carried out to estimate these parameters often fail to
   arrive at sufficiently accurate values. A new approach in evaluating
   drying evaporation pan experiments is presented here based on the
   determination of the initial slope of the curves describing the
   enrichment of the heavy isotopes in the evaporation pan. This approach
   in connection with the use of `in-lake' evaporation pans can lead to a
   substantial reduction of uncertainties of isotope-based lake
   investigations. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The water isotopes (HDO)-O-16 and (H2O)-O-18 are widely used as tracers
   in the global hydrological cycle. The isotope composition of modern
   precipitation is strongly linked to local temperatures in high latitudes
   and, less clearly, to the amount of precipitation in low latitudes. As
   the isotopic composition of precipitation can be reconstructed from many
   palaeo-archives these isotopes serve as quantitative climate proxies for
   the past. In this report we describe the different type of models that
   have been used to understand the global distribution of the isotopic
   composition of precipitation, today and in the past. The focus of this
   paper is on the results of atmospheric general circulation models
   (AGCMs) that have been fitted with water isotope diagnostics. A good
   correspondence between simulated and observed water isotope signals is
   demonstrated on an annual time-scale. In particular the regional and
   seasonal isotope-temperature relations estimated by the AGCMs were in
   good agreement with global observations. Furthermore, we discuss the
   results of the models when they are forced with the climatic boundary
   conditions of 21 kyr BP (last glacial maximum) and of 6 kyr BP
   (mid-Holocene). These numerical experiments allow us to compare directly
   the results of the AGCMs, that is the water isotopes, with the
   corresponding palaeo-observations. We confirmed that in general the
   water isotopes are valuable proxies of temperature variations in high
   latitudes. The calibration of the `isotope- temperature thermometer',
   however, might be biased by local effects, such as the seasonal
   distribution of precipitation or the strength of the local temperature
   inversion. Moreover, comparable `small differences' in the forcing
   compared with today's climate, such as in the mid-Holocene experiment,
   produce small responses of the water isotopes, which are often strongly
   affected by atmospheric circulation changes. Finally, future
   applications of isotopic AGCMs, such as the coupling with the carbon
   cycle or the study of cloud processes, are discussed also. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The use of stable isotopes to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) fluxes
   from vegetated areas is increasing. By complementing conventional net
   flux measurements (gradient or eddy correlation techniques), isotope
   analyses can allow partitioning ET between its gross components, soil
   evaporation and leaf transpiration. Isotopic analyses of atmospheric
   water vapour above canopies can also constrain, or provide alternatives
   for estimating ET. A brief discussion of the isotope approach is aimed
   at highlighting some of the uncertainties that require further research.
   We also demonstrate first, the application of combined concentration and
   isotopic gradient analysis of atmospheric water vapour above crop fields
   in order to estimate ET fluxes and its gross components (soil
   evaporation was estimated at 1.5-3.5\% of mid-day ET flux in a mature
   wheat field). Second, we demonstrate the potential in monitoring
   delta(ss)- delta(L), the difference between predicted and measured leaf
   water delta(18)O values, as an indicator of seasonal variations in
   canopy-scale transpiration in a desert ecosystem (linear correlation
   between this indicator and conventional ET measurements was observed).
   Improving our analytical capabilities for high-precision isotopic
   analysis of very small water vapour samples was a limiting factor in the
   above applications and a method for pyrolysis and on-line O-18 analysis
   of 0.2-2 mu L water samples is described. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley

Abstract = {{The isotopes of the water molecule (tritium, deuterium and oxygen-18)
   are considered to be ideal tracers of the water cycle, an isobalance of
   accumulation and discharge from glaciated areas is therefore
   challenging. In this article we review data from the Alps concerning
   both the isotopic information of accumulated snow and ice and the
   relevant information of glacial discharge on a local to regional scale.
   In the Alps the seasonal distribution of accumulated snow is governed by
   small-scale meteorology and exposition and distribution of cold and
   temperate glaciers. From comparison with direct precipitation
   measurements it follows that uncontrolled erosive loss of parts of the
   seasonal (mainly winter) snow cover is more important for input-output
   considerations of glacial discharge, reconstruction of mean accumulation
   rates and palaeotemperatures by means of isotopes, than occasional
   melting or even rainfall events. The order of magnitude of the latter is
   controlled by laboratory and field experiments. Sublimation and
   evaporation turn out to be of minor influence if only the absolute
   values and not the deuterium excess (the relationship of both stable
   isotopes, deuterium and oxygen-18) is considered. Nevertheless, during
   warming periods a pronounced increase of deuterium excess caused by
   intensive melting and evaporation may be used as an additional climate
   indicator. The different isotopic signature of the seasonal snow cover,
   old glacier ice and groundwater stored in the glacier bed enables a
   quantitative separation of the individual water components discharging
   at a given time of the day or the season. Although several detailed
   isotope studies are reported, a complete isobalance from glaciated areas
   based on an interdisciplinary approach, including hydrology and
   glaciology, is still missing.
   The hydroclimatic imprint of the discharge from glaciated areas remains
   even on a regional scale. Snowmelt shifts the more negative isotope
   values from winter precipitation to the summer months. Interannual
   climatic variability and changes in seasonal distribution of
   precipitation (for instance reduced winter precipitation during the late
   1980s) are recorded by the stable isotopes in precipitation and
   discharge as well indicating that the modification of the isotopic
   information during glacial and post-glacial processes does not override
   climatic trends. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The stable isotope oxygen-18 is often used as a natural tracer in
   stream-flow separation studies in forested catchments. Knowledge about
   the O-18 content of throughfall and soil water is needed. The present
   study was conducted in order to assess the effect of vegetation
   structure on the stable isotope O-18 composition of rainwater input
   during its passage through the canopy and into the unsaturated zone. The
   research area was a small (0.1 km(2)) forested catchment in the
   mountainous `Black Forest' region of southern Germany. During the
   3-month periods (September to December 1995 and April to July 1996)
   several structural units were instrumented according to tree species
   (beech and spruce) and canopy density.
   Overall throughfall was enriched compared with open rainfall by +0.38
   parts per thousand and +0.36 parts per thousand for spruce and beech,
   respectively. Considerable differences existed in the results of the
   crown centre and the crown periphery sites. Throughfall in the crown
   centre showed a higher degree of enrichment, with a mean value of +0.30
   parts per thousand for beech and +0.37 parts per thousand for spruce.
   Enrichment and depletion were observed in the lower canopy density
   locations. Mean results of the crown periphery were similar to those of
   open precipitation (+ 0.15 parts per thousand for beech and -0.01 parts
   per thousand for spruce).
   Soil water was sampled at five different depths (0, 15, 60, 120 and 180
   cm). The signals of individual rainfall events could be traced down to a
   depth of 60 cm. The soil water in the upper layers followed the seasonal
   trend in the precipitation input. At a depth of 180 cm, soil water had a
   very constant delta(18)O value. The O-18 composition of the soil water
   at various depths at different locations showed a similar behaviour. No
   detectable differences could be found between the structural units in
   the different layers, except at 180 cm depth. This might be attributed
   to downslope directed flow at that depth. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley

Abstract = {{A portion of the precipitation samples collected and stored by the
   National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) an shown to be useful for
   analysis of isotopes in precipitation. The potential problems with
   evaporation are small based on deuterium excess analyses and comparisons
   with the Global Meteroic Water Line. Presented here are the delta(18)O
   values of precipitation collected from nine NADP sites during 1989, 1990
   and 1991. The trends in the isotopic (delta(18)O) characteristics of
   recent precipitation are in agreement with findings from previous
   International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) sites in the USA. The findings
   are also in agreement with several major isotope-environment
   relationships, further supporting the use of these samples for a modern
   global data base on the isotopes in precipitation being developed by
   IAEA, called GNIP (Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation) and for
   use by research groups in the hydrological modelling, palaeoclimate and
   ecological communities.
   As expected, the average delta(18)O values of precipitation that is
   derived from the Gulf of Mexico (- 3 parts per thousand) and from the
   Pacific North-west are isotopically distinct (- 7 parts per thousand).
   In addition, using the NADP network, isotopic depletion in the
   delta(18)O values of precipitation in the range of 8 parts per thousand
   was observed from coastal to inland locations either in the Pacific
   North-west or along the east side of the Rocky Mountains, from Texas to
   Eastern Montana. In central USA, especially at high elevation, there is
   a strong seasonal variation in the delta(18)O values of precipitation,
   differing by almost 25 parts per thousand between January and August,
   whereas at coastal locations the seasonal variation in the delta(18)O
   values of precipitation was minimal. Comparisons between the average
   delta(18)O values of precipitation from several NADP sites and those of
   the IAEA collected in the 1960s and 1970s are exceptionally comparable,
   differing in some cases by only 0.1 parts per thousand, further
   substantiating the quality and utility of precipitation from this
   network. The delta(18)O-temperature relationships for two of our sites
   had slopes of 0.55 (Colorado) and 0.46 (Nebraska) that are within the
   range of those reported earlier (0.29-0.7), although they are slightly
   lower, possibly owing to the large temperature variation between winter
   and summer in central USA. Further, the seasonal variation in the
   delta(18)O values of precipitation are used in a pair of ecological
   studies to articulate water sources of different plant life forms in
   riparian and prairie ecosystems, with grasses typically using summer
   rain to a much greater extent than woody species, such as willow or
   saltbush. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The delta(18)O characteristics of water masses contributing to flow in
   the Econlockhatchee River basin, a subtropical low-gradient watershed in
   central Florida, were monitored to assess the potential for applying
   hydrograph separation models in the watershed. Daily sampling for a
   2-month period in autumn 1992 revealed ranges in precipitation of - 6.64
   to - 0.17 parts per thousand, in surficial groundwater of - 3.29 to -
   2.90 parts per thousand, and in river water of - 2.68 to - 1.41 parts
   per thousand. Results indicated that river delta(18)O was consistently
   more enriched than either groundwater or precipitation by about 1 parts
   per thousand, prompting the hypothesis that evaporative enrichment
   significantly altered the delta(18)O of river water. Additional
   monitoring and mass-balance modelling of the entire basin (620 km(2))
   and a subcatchment (70 km(2)) showed that evaporative effects could
   account for the observed enrichment. Although some enrichment occurred
   in headwater swamps and wetlands, the field data and modelling results
   supported the hypothesis that evaporation from the river channel
   significantly altered the delta(18)O of river water. Enrichment
   elsewhere in the hydrological cycle, such as during throughfall or
   temporary storage in wetlands or stormwater management ponds, may have
   contributed to the observed signal of evaporation, but could not be
   distinguished from headwater or river evaporation. It appears that a
   sufficient isotopic signal exists in central Florida precipitation to
   apply hydrograph separation models, but that evaporative isotopic
   enrichment should be included as a modelling element. Copyright (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Runoff characteristics in a low-gradient central-Florida watershed were
   analysed using environmental delta(18)O and a series of
   conservative-tracer mass-balance models applied to a storm event (109 mm
   over approximately 30 h) monitored in May and June 1993 on the
   Econlockhatchee River, Florida. The assumption of steady-state
   conditions implicit in the widely used two-component mixing model was
   tested by applying steady-state and non-steady-state models for a
   subcatchment (215 km(2)) of the river. Both models indicated that about
   76\% of the resulting river flow was composed of pre-storm water. A
   third mass-balance model (steady-state) was developed to separate
   pre-storm from storm-event runoff over a discrete reach of the river,
   which had a contributing area of 135 km(2). This model indicated that
   approximately 47\% of the water entering the reach could be attributed
   to pre-storm water. The greater proportion of event water entering the
   reach was attributed to suburban development in the watershed and
   indicates that urbanization in watersheds not only affects the timing,
   peak and total runoff, but also may change flow-paths for runoff, and
   may significantly affect down-stream water quality. Copyright (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Diffuse vadose zone soil-water flux is minuscule in semi-arid
   environments. Measurements of soil suction and hydraulic conductivity
   are prone to errors and their use leads to unreliable flux estimates.
   Often, unambiguous environmental tracer profiles are available in the
   unsaturated zone soil profile. They can be used to obtain robust
   estimates of the soil-water flux by applying simple analytical models.
   Environmental tracers are very suitable because they normally occur in
   small concentrations and do not disturb the natural flow system
   significantly. They also provide integrated values of the flux over
   longer periods of time and in balance with the local vegetation or land
   use patterns. Current techniques enable small concentrations of these
   tracers to be measured reliably. In the present instance three different
   tracer profiles were used to obtain flux estimates by using very simple
   models requiring minimal input data. If tracer profiles suggest that
   diffusion dominates the transport process then the use of simple models
   is justified.
   The shape of the tracer profiles in conjunction with the water contents
   and porosity data suggest that tracer advection and dispersion was of
   minor importance. Soil-water flux was first estimated by using the
   tritium peak-migration and tritium mass-balance methods. A heat
   diffusion analogy was also used to match the observed tritium profile.
   Chloride mass balance of the profile was used to obtain another flux
   estimate. A modification of the chloride mass-balance method was also
   used to obtain advective and diffusive components of moisture flux.
   Simple piston flow models based on peak migration were used to obtain
   additional estimates from chloride and nitrate profiles. The estimates
   obtained were of the same order of magnitude and within the range
   reported for semi-arid regions in other parts of the world. Copyright

Abstract = {{The vertical distributions of O-18 and H-2 in porewater of a
   glaciolacustrine clay were simulated to explore the potential
   conservation of signals deriving from changes in the isotopic
   composition of Holocene precipitation in low-permeability deposits. The
   simulations used a groundwater velocity of zero, assuming that transport
   was solely by diffusion. As expected, distributions were highly
   sensitive to the timing of Holocene events, with recent events having
   the greatest preservation potential. Simulations show that these signals
   are confined to the area immediately below the weathered zone, where
   infiltration of modern water via fractures or fluctuations in the water
   table could threaten signal preservation in the field. Century-scale
   events with magnitudes of 6 parts per thousand or less in delta(18)O
   have little effect on the isotopic profiles if they occur more than 1000
   years ago. Longer duration events occurring more than 1000 years ago are
   preserved as slight alterations in the shape of the isotopic profiles.
   Differences in the effective diffusion coefficients for
   (HHO)-H-1-H-2-O-16 and (H2O)-H-1-O-18 result in alteration of the
   original d-excess (d = delta(2)H-8 delta(18)O). Hence this parameter is
   not conservative in groundwater environments where transport is
   dominantly by diffusion. On the other hand, simulated vertical profiles
   of d-excess amplify fluctuations in the isotopic composition of
   precipitation that are subdued in the individual profiles of delta(18)O
   and delta(2)H.
   Simulations that include Holocene events with timings, durations and
   magnitudes estimated for the Hypsithermal, Medieval Warm Period and
   Little Ice Age result in distributions that differ from the baseline by
   approximate to 0.6 parts per thousand in delta(18)O (approximate to 5
   parts per thousand in delta(2)H). That these events are preserved as a
   measurable offset in the isotopic profile suggests that some aquitards
   can be used to reconstruct or constrain mid to late Holocene
   palaeoprecipitation. The small magnitude of these positive offsets
   suggest that exclusion of Holocene events in the input functions used to
   constrain parameters by fitting measured isotopic profiles with
   simulated diffusion profiles, probably has a minimal effect on the
   parameters they are used to estimate, but could result in a slight
   overestimation of parameters such as velocity or time since
   deglaciation. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In 1991, one of Australia's longest rivers, the Darling-Barwon,
   experienced one of the world's largest recorded algal blooms. Nearly
   1000 km of river were affected. At the time of the bloom phosphorus
   originating from anthropogenic sources was believed to be the principal
   cause. In this study we have used major element chemistry to examine the
   sources of sediment and sediment-associated phosphorus delivered to the
   Darling-Barwon River. We show that the sediments are derived primarily
   from the sedimentary and granitic bedrock areas of the catchment, not
   the intensively farmed basalt areas. We also show that the sediment
   currently in transport in the Darling-Barwon does not originate from
   contemporary upland erosion, but is probably derived from lowland areas
   of the catchment that contain more weathered material. Phosphorus
   concentrations in the sediments are consistent with those in natural
   soils of the region, and evidence from two sediment cores indicates that
   phosphorus concentrations have not changed significantly in the last 200
   years. The implications of these findings for algal growth control
   strategies are discussed. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Water samples from forest soils and a shallow cave underlying them were
   collected for the hydrological year 1996-1997. The soil waters did not
   display much seasonal variability in concentrations of organic
   substances in them but the cave waters yielded distinct highest levels
   in the spring and autumn seasons. The important controls on the amount
   of organic substances reaching the cave are the seasonal fluctuation in
   volume of the percolation waters and the soil's ability to provide
   organic material for these waters. Fluorescence studies of the organic
   compounds isolated from these waters revealed shorter peak excitation
   and emission wavelengths for the cave waters than for the soil waters, a
   result of both differences in concentration and probably also of
   significant change in the proportional organic assemblages in the
   waters. Precipitation appears to affect the fluorescence in both waters,
   with the dry autumn producing the highest yields. Molecular size
   fractionation revealed how the larger hydrophobic compounds are
   preferentially removed from the water before it reaches the cave, with
   the consequence that the smaller hydrophilic compounds become the
   dominant fluorophore there. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Runoff components of the Zastler catchment (18.4 km(2), southern Black
   Forest, Germany) were analysed with hydrograph separations using stable
   oxygen isotopes and dissolved silica. It was shown that event water and
   components with low silica contributed only small amounts to total
   runoff. In addition, comparison of the two-component hydrograph
   separations showed that the low-silica components are generated by both
   event water and pre-event water fractions, depending on the state of the
   system.
   A modified three-component hydrograph separation method was introduced
   using dissolved silica and O-18. During storm events an interaction of
   three runoff components having distinct silica concentrations could be
   shown. Based on the geological and geomorphological genesis of the study
   site, it was appropriate to assign (i) the low silica component to the
   riparian zones and impermeable areas, (ii) the medium silica component
   to the periglacial debris cover and (iii) the high silica component to
   the crystalline detritus and crystalline hard rock.
   Exact quantification of the runoff components remained difficult.
   However, runoff components with medium silica concentrations reacted
   very sensitively and intensely. The contribution of this component to
   total runoff is comparatively large. This shows the important role of
   the periglacial debris to runoff generation of the study site and
   emphasizes the importance of runoff generation processes occurring in
   this reservoir. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an investigation of the time to peak of unit
   response functions for design flood studies. It is based on an empirical
   analysis of observed rainfall-runoff data for 49 basins in the UK and
   explores the relationship between unit response time to peak (t(p)) and
   flood peak magnitude (Q(p)). The results show that t(p) varies
   significantly between events but suggest a systematic relationship
   between t(p) and Q(p). The relationships which have been developed
   suggest that t(p) decreases with flood magnitude and approaches to an
   asymptotic value for very large values of Q(p). These findings confirm
   numerous physical and field investigations and also support the
   reduction in response time for probable maximum flood (PMF) recommended
   in the Soil Conservation Services method, the Flood Studies Report
   method and the Flood Estimation Handbook. The findings also suggest that
   t(p) should be modified in unit hydrograph methods of design flood
   analysis for return periods that differ from those used in deriving unit
   hydrographs. A simple correction curve has been developed for adjusting
   t(p) according to the design flood return period. Copyright (C) 2000

Abstract = {{During the filling of surface microrelief depressions the precipitation
   excess (precipitation minus infiltration and interception) is divided
   between surface storage and runoff i.e. runoff starts before the surface
   depressions are filled. Information on the division of precipitation
   excess is needed for modelling surface runoff during the filling of
   surface depressions. Furthermore, information on the surface of the area
   covered with water is needed for calculating infiltration of water
   stored in soil surface depressions. Thirty-two soil surface microreliefs
   were determined in Danish erosion study plots. The slope was c. 10\% for
   all plots. Data were treated initially by removing the slope, after
   which 20 `artificial' slopes (1-20\%) were introduced producing 640 new
   data sets. Runoff during filling of the microrelief storage was
   calculated for each of the 640 data sets using a model developed for
   calculating surface storage and runoff from grid elevation measurements.
   Runoff started immediately after the first addition of water for all
   data sets. On a field scale, however, runoff has to travel some distance
   as overland flow and storage in smaller and larger depressions below the
   runoff initiation point must be taken into consideration. The runoff
   increases by intermittent steps. Whenever a depression starts to
   overflow to the border of the plot, the runoff jumps accordingly. In
   spite of the jumps, the distribution between surface storage and runoff
   was closely related to the quotient between precipitation excess and
   depression storage capacity. Surface area covered with water was
   exponentially related to the amount of water stored in surface
   depressions. Models for calculating surface storage and runoff from grid
   elevation measurements are cumbersome and require time-consuming
   measurements of the soil surface microrelief. Therefore, estimation from
   roughness indices requiring fewer measurements is desirable. New
   improved equations for such estimations are suggested. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{This study quantifies the influence of rainfall on surface evaporation
   in the Sahel. A numerical model of the surface is used to extend the
   observations taken during the HAPEX-Sahel project, and is forced by 2
   years of rain-gauge data. The model is applied to the Southern Super
   Site (SSS), which covers an area of less than 100 km(2). The effects of
   rainfall variability (spatial and temporal) on soil moisture, vegetation
   growth and evaporation are explored. Contrasting rainfall conditions
   between the two years produce observed differences in the timing of the
   seasonal growth cycle. This correlates well with modelled root-zone
   moisture deficits, and exerts a modest influence on transpiration rates.
   The evolution of surface evaporation is dominated, however, by the bare
   soil contribution in the day or two after a storm. This component also
   exerts a strong influence on the spatial variability of fluxes across
   the SSS, particularly when rain falls only in part of the area. In these
   cases, differences in evaporation between recently wetted and dry areas
   can reach 3.5 mm day(-1). Observations indicate that during a period of
   persistent rainfall gradients across the SSS, the lower atmosphere
   maintained a `memory' of past rainfall patterns through humidity
   contrasts. These were the result of gradients in surface soil moisture,
   and therefore evaporation. The model results therefore support the
   possibility of a positive surface feedback mechanism affecting rainfall
   patterns in the region. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The antecedent soil moisture status of a catchment is an important
   factor in hydrological modelling. Traditional Hortonian infiltration
   models assume that the initial moisture content is constant across the
   whole catchment, despite the fact that even in small catchments
   antecedent soil moisture exhibits tremendous spatial heterogeneity.
   Spatial patterns of soil water distribution across three transects (two
   in a burnt area and one in an unburnt area) in a semi-arid area were
   studied. At the transect scale, when the factors affecting soil moisture
   were limited to topographical position or local topography, spatial
   patterns showed time stability, but when other factors, such as
   vegetation, were taken into account, the spatial patterns became time
   unstable. At the point scale, and in the same areas, topographical
   position was the main factor controlling time stability. Scale
   dependence of time stability was studied and local topography and
   vegetation presence were observed to play an important role for the
   correlation between consecutive measures depending on the scale.

Abstract = {{Drought parameters, namely the longest duration, largest severity and
   the intensity have been calculated in relation to the truncation levels

   and log-normal probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the drought
   variables. The drought variables taken in the investigation are the
   annual rainfall and runoff time-series evolving randomly and obeying the
   Markovian dependence. The analysis showed that the assumption of
   independence of the drought duration and intensity works well in
   deriving the expression for drought severity at various truncation
   levels. An estimate of drought intensity has been realized from the
   concept of the truncated normal distribution of the standardized form of
   the time-series of drought variables in the normalized domain.
   Furthermore the non-normality and the dependence in the time-series have
   a significant effect on the drought parameters at the truncation levels

Abstract = {{The effects of slope, cover and surface roughness on rainfall runoff,
   infiltration and erosion were determined at two sites on a hillside
   vineyard in Napa County, California, using a portable rainfall
   simulator. Rainfall simulation experiments were carried out at two
   sites, with five replications of three slope treatments (5\%, 10\% and
   15\%) in a randomized block design at each site (0.64 m(2) plots). Prior
   to initiation of the rainfall simulations, detailed assessments, not
   considered in previous vineyard studies, of soil slope, cover and
   surface roughness were conducted.
   Significant correlations (at the 95\% confidence level) between the
   physical characteristics of slope, cover and surface roughness, with
   total infiltration, runoff, sediment discharge and average sediment
   concentration were obtained. The extent of soil cracking, a physical
   characteristic not directly measured, also affected analysis of the
   rainfall-runoff-erosion process. Average cumulative runoff and
   cumulative sediment discharge from site A was 87\% and 242\% greater,
   respectively, than at site B. This difference was linked to the greater
   cover, extent of soil cracking and bulk density at site B than at site
   A. The extent of soil cover was the dominant factor limiting soil loss
   when soil cracking was not present. Field slopes within the range of
   4-16\%, although a statistically significant factor affecting soil
   losses, had only a minor impact on the amount of soil loss. The Horton
   infiltration equation fit field data better than the modified Philip's
   equation. Owing to the variability in the `treatment' parameters
   affecting the rainfall-runoff-erosion process, use of ANOVA methods were
   found to be inappropriate: multiple-factor regression analysis was more
   useful for identifying significant parameters. Overall, we obtained
   similar values for soil erosion parameters as those obtained from
   vineyard erosion studies in Europe. In addition, it appears that results
   from the small plot studies may be adequately scaled up one to two
   orders of magnitude in terms of land areas considered. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Using meteorological data collected in the summer of 1996 and 1997,
   three evapotranspiration (ET) models, the Penman-Monteith (PM), the
   modified Penman for non-saturated surface, and the two-source models
   were applied to estimate hourly ET from different land-use covers of the
   Paddle River Basin (area = 265 km(2)). By assuming closed canopy
   conditions, the PM model could estimate the ET of coniferous forest and
   agricultural land because the contribution of soil evaporation under
   these land covers is not significant. For mixed forest and pasturelands
   that are partially vegetated, however, the amount of soil evaporation is
   significant and so PM underestimated the total ET. The modified Penman
   model mainly underestimated hourly ET during daytime when the atmosphere
   is unstable, but overestimated ET during early morning and late
   afternoon (stable atmosphere), particularly for pastureland. By
   re-establishing a relationship for the relative evaporation, the ET
   simulated by the modified Penman model improved. Both PM and the
   modified Penman are assessed with respect to the comprehensive,
   two-source model's simulated ET because the latter agrees favourably
   with the ET obtained from the basin water balance. The water balance ET
   is reliable because it is based on the streamflow, surface temperature,
   net radiation and soil moisture simulated by the semi-distributed
   hydrological model, Semi-distributed Physically based Hydrologic
   Model-Remote Sensing, DPHM-RS (host to the two-source model), all of
   which have been demonstrated to agree well with the observed data.

Abstract = {{Infiltration excess overland flow has been identified as the dominant
   flow pathway in recently reclaimed surface mined watersheds as a result
   of compaction and sorting during the reclamation procedure. Therefore,
   there could be a fairly direct relationship between runoff generated
   from the hillslopes to that measured at the watershed outlet. A 3-year
   study was initiated in 1993 to determine how well surface runoff at a
   watershed scale could be predicted from 1-m(2) runoff frames placed on
   hillslopes in two reclaimed surface-mined watersheds in central Alberta.
   Runoff from the hillslope frames suggests outlet discharge should be
   high from the 3.4-ha Sandy Subsoil Watershed and much less for the
   9.8-ha West Watershed, but the opposite occurred. Most of the hillslope
   runoff from the Sandy Subsoil Watershed infiltrated once it reached the
   channel and depression storage played an insignificant role in
   determining runoff. In contrast, most of the runoff from the West
   Watershed originated from rain falling directly on the saturated channel
   (depression storage) or near-channel saturated areas, rather than the
   hillslopes. Neither watershed runoff magnitude nor timing could be
   predicted from the same parameters for hillslope runoff frames for
   either reclaimed watershed. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Topographic characteristics computed from 100- and 1000-m resolution
   digital elevation model (DEM) data are compared for 50 locations
   representing varied terrain in the conterminous USA. The topographic
   characteristics are three parameters used extensively in hydrological
   research and modelling - slope (S), specific catchment area (A(s)) and a
   wetness index computed as the logarithm of the specific catchment area
   divided by slope {[}ln(A(s)/S)]. Slope values computed from 1000-m DEMs
   are smaller than those computed from 100-m DEMs; specific catchment area
   and the wetness index are larger for the 1000-m DEMs compared with the
   100-m DEMs. Most of the differences between the 100- and 1000-m
   resolution DEMs can be attributed to terrain-discretization effects in
   the computation of the topographic characteristics and are not the
   result of smoothing or loss of terrain detail in the coarse data. In
   general, the terrain-discretization effects are greatest on flat terrain
   with long length-scale features, and the smoothing effects are greatest
   on steep terrain with short length-scale features. For the most part,
   the differences in the average values of the topographic characteristics
   computed from 100- and 1000-m resolution DEMs are predictable; that is,
   biases in the mean values for the characteristics computed from a 1000-m
   DEM can be corrected with simple linear equations. Copyright (C) 2000

Abstract = {{A non-linear least-squares (NLS) method is used without regularization
   to recover the release history of a groundwater contaminant plume from
   its current measured spatial distribution. The flow system is assumed to
   be one-dimensional, with the plume originating from a known single site.
   The solution is found to be very sensitive to noise and to the extent to
   which the plume is dissipated. Although the NLS method is extremely
   sensitive to measurement errors for the gradual release scenario, it can
   resolve the release histories for catastrophic release scenarios
   reasonably well, even in the presence of moderate measurement errors. A
   number of synthetic numerical examples are analysed. We find that for
   catastrophic contaminant releases the NLS method may be an alternative
   to the Tikhonov regularization approach. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley

Abstract = {{A process-based, spatially distributed hydrological model was developed
   to quantitatively simulate the energy and mass transfer processes and
   their interactions within arctic regions (arctic hydrological and
   thermal model, ARHYTHM). The model first determines the flow direction
   in each element, the channel drainage network and the drainage area
   based upon the digital elevation data. Then it simulates various
   physical processes: including snow ablation, subsurface flow, overland
   flow and channel flow routing, soil thawing and evapotranspiration. The
   kinematic wave method is used for conducting overland flow and channel
   flow routing. The subsurface flow is simulated using the Darcian
   approach. The energy balance scheme was the primary approach used in
   energy-related process simulations (snowmelt and evapotranspiration),
   although there are options to model snowmelt by the degree-day method
   and evapotranspiration by the Priestley-Taylor equation. This
   hydrological model simulates the dynamic interactions of each of these
   processes and can predict spatially distributed snowmelt, soil moisture
   and evapotranspiration over a watershed at each time step as well as
   discharge in any specified channel(s). The model was applied to Imnavait
   watershed (about 2.2 km(2)) and the Upper Kuparuk River basin (about 146
   km(2)) in northern Alaska. Simulated results of spatially distributed
   soil moisture content, discharge at gauging stations, snowpack ablations
   curves and other results yield reasonable agreement, both spatially and
   temporally, with available data sets such as SAR imagery-generated soil
   moisture data and field measurements of snowpack ablation, and discharge
   data at selected points. The initial timing of simulated discharge does
   not compare well with the measured data during snowmelt periods mainly
   because the effect of snow damming on runoff was not considered in the
   model. Results from the application of this model demonstrate that
   spatially distributed models have the potential for improving our
   understanding of hydrology for certain settings. Finally, a critical
   component that led to the performance of this modelling is the coupling
   of the mass and energy processes. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{An exceptional ablation event resulted in the destruction of a network
   of glacier survey stakes on the Brewster Glacier, New Zealand. Up to 5 m
   of surface lowering occurred over 26 days, releasing at least 1.6 x

   snowpack by rainfall and consequent slushflows. Slushflows permit
   surface lowering at rates greater than expected from the surface energy
   balance on snow. Resulting slushflow events may significantly influence
   glacier mass balance, and may constitute a hazard. Little is known of

Abstract = {{In this study a new method is developed to determine a flow duration
   curve (FDC) for a process in which stream flow is defined as a product
   of two variables, representing the periodic and the stochastic
   components, respectively. The cumulative frequency distribution is
   obtained via integration procedures and also given as an algorithm for
   discrete variables. Hence the exceedance probability for any given flow
   value can be calculated. The method is applied to daily flow data from
   many sites and it is found that the FDCs based on this method compare
   well with the observed FDC. Furthermore the FDCs developed in this
   method compare well with other methods in the recent literature. It was
   found that non-dimensional flow duration curves in Turkey can be
   characterized by three, or sometimes just two, parameters. Values of
   these parameters have been estimated at many sites enabling a FDC to be
   constructed at neighbouring sites for which only the drainage basin area
   is known. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Data on drop size distribution and kinetic energy load of rainstorms are
   basic for rainfall erosivity indices. A simple and relatively
   inexpensive instrument was used to asses the instantaneous intensity and
   kinetic energy load of rainstorms in Hong Kong. Both the drop size and
   the instantaneous kinetic energy load of rainfall in Hong Kong are
   greater than in temperate and subtropical climates. The high kinetic
   energy results from the large size and greater number of raindrops
   falling per unit time. A high correlation between the kinetic energy of
   rainfall and the amount of rainfall allows for a convenient estimate of
   the energy load of storms from the amount of rainfall. Of more
   significance to the erosion process is the determination that about 74\%
   of the total annual rainfall is erosive, containing about three-quarters
   of the total annual energy load of the rains. The variability of
   rainfall parameters within a rainfall and from storm to storm is shown.
   The energy-intensity relationship, seasonal and annual distributions of
   rainfall erosivity are presented. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The paper describes a parsimonious approach for generating continuous
   daily stream-flow time-series from observed daily rainfall data in a
   catchment. The key characteristic in the method is a duration curve. It
   is used to convert the daily rainfall information from source rain
   gauges into a continuous daily hydrograph at the destination river site.
   For each source rain gauge a time-series of rainfall related `current
   precipitation index' is generated and its duration curve is established.
   The current precipitation index reflects the current catchment wetness
   and is defined as a continuous function of precipitation, which
   accumulates on rainy days and exponentially decays during the periods of
   no rainfall. The process of rainfall-to-runoff conversion is based on
   the assumption that daily current precipitation index values at rainfall
   site(s) in a catchment and the destination site's daily flows correspond
   to similar probabilities on their respective duration curves. The method
   is tested in several small catchments in South Africa. The method is
   designed primarily for application at ungauged sites in data-poor
   regions where the use of more complex and information consuming
   techniques of data generation may not be justified. Copyright (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Single domain models may seriously underestimate leaching of nutrients
   and pesticides to groundwater in clay soils with shrinkage cracks.
   Various two-domain models have been developed, either empirical or
   physically based, which take into account the effects of cracks on water
   flow and solute transport. This paper presents a model concept that uses
   the clay shrinkage characteristics to derive crack volume and crack
   depth under transient field conditions. The concept has been developed
   to simulate field average behaviour of a field with cracks, rather than
   flow and transport at a small plot. Water flow and solute transport are
   described with basic physics, which allow process and scenario analysis.
   The model concept is part of the more general agrohydrological model
   SWAP, and is applied to a field experiment on a cracked clay soil, at
   which water flow and bromide transport were measured during 572 days. A
   single domain model was not able to mimic the held-average water flow
   and solute transport. Incorporation of the crack concept considerably
   improved the simulation of water content and bromide leaching to the
   groundwater. Still deviations existed between the measured and simulated
   bromide concentration profiles. The model did not reproduce the observed
   bromide retardation in the top layer and the high bromide dispersion
   resulting from water infiltration at various soil depths. A sensitivity
   analysis showed that the amounts of bromide leached were especially
   sensitive to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the top layer, the
   solute transfer from the soil matrix to crack water flow and the mean
   residence time of rapid drainage. The shrinkage characteristic and the
   soil hydraulic properties of the clay matrix showed a low sensitivity.

Abstract = {{An inexpensive, mobile field rainfall simulator and runoff plot frame
   were developed for use on hillside vineyards. The simulator framework
   and components were lightweight, readily available and easily manageable
   such that they can be handled by one person during transport, set-up and
   operation. The vineyard rainfall simulator was simpler than many of the
   machines in recent use for similar studies, yet offered equal or
   improved performance for small-plot studies. The system developed
   consistent sized 258 mm raindrops at intensities ranging from 20 to 90
   mm/h. The average distribution uniformity coefficient at an intensity of
   60 mm/h was 91.7\%, with a deviation of only 2.2\%. This coefficient was
   similar to the range reported for a more complex rotating disk
   simulator, and was notably greater than that obtained for other similar
   devices. The system water capacity of 40 l allowed for 1-h storm
   durations at 60 mm/h, usually sufficient time for commencement of
   erosion and runoff. The runoff plot frame was designed to be quickly
   installed, and to discourage sediment deposition in the routing of
   runoff to collect containers. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Relationships between gravimetric soil moisture content (w) and matric
   potential (phi(m)), and between volumetric soil moisture content
   (theta(v)) and pressure head (h) were approximated for the unsaturated
   zone on Long Island, New York. Soil samples were collected from two
   sites using a hand auger. The soil moisture content was determined using
   the filter-paper (w(f)) and gravimetric (w) methods, respectively. The
   w, was then used in an empirical equation to estimate phi(m). Each set
   of phi(m) and w was combined with a straight-line empirical model to
   obtain a w(phi(m)) relationship. Soil phi(m) was converted to h, and w
   to the volumetric moisture content theta(v), in order to produce a
   theta(v)(h) curve. Graphical and statistical comparison showed that the
   resulting theta(v)(h) curves fell within one order of magnitude of
   similar curves generated by a more sophisticated non-linear model
   developed previously. The simplicity and low cost of the filter-paper
   approach described in this study recommends it for preliminary studies

Abstract = {{The removal of chemicals in solution by overland how from agricultural
   land has the potential to be a significant source of chemical loss where
   chemicals are applied to the soil surface, as in zero tillage and
   surface-mulched farming systems. Currently, we lack detailed
   understanding of the transfer mechanism between the soil solution and
   overland flow, particularly under field conditions. A model of solute
   transfer from soil solution to overland flow was developed. The model is
   based on the hypothesis that a solute is initially distributed uniformly
   throughout the soil pore space in a thin layer at the soil surface. A
   fundamental assumption of the model is that at the time runoff
   commences, any solute at the soil surface that could be transported into
   the soil with the infiltrating water will already have been convected
   away from the area of potential exchange. Solute remaining at the soil
   surface is therefore not subject to further infiltration and may be
   approximated as a layer of tracer on a plane impermeable surface. The
   model fitted experimental data very well in all but one trial. The model
   in its present form focuses on the exchange of solute between the soil
   solution and surface water after the commencement of runoff. Future
   model development requires the relationship between the mass transfer
   parameters of the model and the time to runoff: to be defined. This
   would enable the model to be used for extrapolation beyond the specific
   experimental results of this study. The close agreement between
   experimental results and model simulations shows that the simple
   transfer equation proposed in this study has promise for estimating
   solute loss to surface runoff. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Spatial distribution of soil macroporosity was determined for a forest
   podzol from tension infiltrometer measurements at the soil surface.
   Surface-derived macroporosity values were compared with point
   infiltration characteristics obtained from soil water content and soil
   water chemistry measurements during an experimental irrigation, and with
   parameters of a kinematic wave model applied to soil water content data.
   Macroporosity estimated by the tension infiltrometer ranged from 0.00087
   to 0.0219\% of soil volume, and infiltration at these two sites was
   dominated by propagation of a well-defined wetting front through the
   soil profile and bypass flow via soil macropores, respectively.
   Infiltration at sites with intermediate macroporosities reflected a
   combination of these two processes, although results were inconclusive
   at one site owing to lateral flow at the base of the soil profile. There
   was no agreement between macroporosities estimated by the tension
   infiltrometer and the kinematic wave model. The maximum soil conductance
   parameter within the profile at a site, however, was related directly to
   the surface-derived macroporosity. The partial agreement between
   surface-derived macroporosity estimates and point infiltration
   characteristics shown here supports the use of tension infiltrometry as
   a rapid, non-destructive method of assessing spatial variations in the
   relative contribution of macropore flow to the infiltration process.

Abstract = {{Geochemical data indicate that the Springfield Plateau aquifer, a
   carbonate aquifer of the Ozark Plateaus Province in central USA, has two
   distinct hydrochemical zones. Within each hydrochemical zone, water from
   springs is geochemically and isotopically different than water from
   wells. Geochemical data indicate that spring water generally interacts
   less with the surrounding rock and has a shorter residence time,
   probably as a result of flowing along discrete fractures and solution
   openings, than water from wells.
   Water type throughout most of the aquifer was calcium bicarbonate,
   indicating that carbonate-rock dissolution is the primary geochemical
   process occurring in the aquifer. Concentrations of calcium,
   bicarbonate, dissolved oxygen and tritium indicate that most ground
   water in the aquifer recharged rapidly and is relatively young (less
   than 40 years). In general, field-measured properties, concentrations of
   many chemical constituents, and calcite saturation indices were greater
   in samples from the northern part of the aquifer (hydrochemical zone A)
   than in samples from the southern part of the aquifer (hydrochemical
   zone B). Factors affecting differences in the geochemical composition of
   ground water between the two zones are difficult to identify, but could
   be related to differences in chert content and possibly primary
   porosity, solubility of the limestone, and amount and type of
   cementation between zone A than in zone B.
   In addition, specific conductance, pH, alkalinity, concentrations of
   many chemical constituents and calcite saturation indices were greater
   in samples from wells than in samples from springs in each hydrochemical
   zone.
   In contrast, concentrations of dissolved oxygen, nitrite plus nitrate,
   and chloride generally were greater in samples from springs than in
   samples from wells. Water from springs generally flows rapidly through
   large conduits with minimum water-rock interactions. Water from wells
   flow through small fractures, which restrict how and increase water-rock
   interactions. As a result, springs tend to be more susceptible to
   surface contamination than wells. The results of this study have
   important implications for the geochemical and hydrogeological processes
   of similar carbonate aquifers in other geographical locations. Copyright

Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2000}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of the hydrological effects of vegetation changes in the
   Columbia River basin over the last century was performed using two land
   cover scenarios. The first was a reconstruction of historical land cover
   vegetation, c. 1900, as estimated by the federal Interior Columbia Basin
   Ecosystem Management Project (ICBEMP), The second was current land cover
   as estimated from remote sensing data for 1990. Simulations were
   performed using the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) hydrological
   model, applied at one-quarter degree spatial resolution (approximately
   500 km(2) grid cell area) using hydrometeorological data for a 10 year
   period starting in 1979, and the 1900 and current vegetation scenarios.
   The model represents surface hydrological fluxes and state variables,
   including snow accumulation and ablation, evapotranspiration, soil
   moisture and runoff production. Simulated daily hydrographs of
   naturalized streamflow (reservoir effects removed) were aggregated to
   monthly totals and compared for nine selected sub-basins. The results
   show that, hydrologically, the most important vegetation-related change
   has been a general tendency towards decreased vegetation maturity in the
   forested areas of the basin. This general trend represents a balance
   between the effects of logging and fire suppression. In those areas
   where forest maturity has been reduced as a result of logging,
   wintertime maximum snow accumulations, and hence snow available for
   runoff during the spring melt season, have tended to increase, and
   evapotranspiration has decreased. The reverse has occurred in areas
   where fire suppression has tended to increase vegetation maturity,
   although the logging effect appears to dominate for most of the
   sub-basins evaluated. Predicted streamflow changes were largest in the
   Mica and Corralin sub-basins in the northern and eastern headwaters
   region; in the Priest Rapids sub-basin, which drains the east slopes of
   the Cascade Mountains; and in the Ice Harbor sub-basin, which receives
   flows primarily from the Salmon and Clearwater Rivers of Idaho and
   western Montana. For these sub-basins, annual average increases in
   runoff ranged from 4.2 to 10.7\% and decreases in evapotranspiration
   ranged from 3.1 to 12.1\%. In comparison with previous studies of
   individual, smaller sized watersheds, the modelling approach used in
   this study provides predictions of hydrological fluxes that are
   spatially continuous throughout the interior Columbia River basin. It
   thus provides a broad-scale framework for assessing the vulnerability of
   watersheds to altered streamflow regimes attributable to changes in land
   cover that occur over large geographical areas and long time-frames.

Abstract = {{Extreme rainfall events occur frequently in the central Pyrenees, but
   they are responsible for mass movements and short, very intense erosion
   periods, accompanied at times by loss of human life and high costs of
   infrastructure. This paper tries to assess the existence of patterns in
   the spatial distribution of maximum precipitation. The calculation of
   return periods of the most intense rainfall demonstrates that in the
   Pyrenees it exhibits an erratic spatial and temporal distribution and
   can be extremely localized. In the case of precipitation between 150 and
   200 mm in 24 h, some influence from the surrounding relief has been
   found, but this is not the case for precipitation exceeding 200 mm,
   characterized by the absence of patterns governing their spatial
   distribution. Geomorphological approaches are, therefore, the only way
   for assessing the areas more subject to hydromorphological risks.

Abstract = {{The documentation existing on both land use and the delineation of
   pervious and impervious zones in urban areas tends to be rather
   complete. In addition, topographical information (altitudes, slopes) is
   generally available, although contours are not drawn in detail on
   urban-area maps. The development of urban databases has provided a
   convenient means of accessing this information for the purpose of
   hydrological modelling. The objective of this paper is to evaluate a
   recent model, `SURF' (semi-urbanized runoff flow), specifically
   developed for coupling with a GIS based on a digital terrain
   representation. This model was evaluated by use of an original approach
   from the field of urban hydrology. A 7-year continuous data series,
   which includes the dry periods, has been used as input to run the model.
   The principles behind the SURF model are briefly described herein. A
   sensitivity analysis is then performed in order to select the most
   influential parameters. Following the calibration stage, the model's
   validation is discussed. This validation is conducted not only by
   comparing observed and simulated hydrographs, but also by comparing the
   SURF model with a more conventional model in urban hydrology, called the
   URBAN model. It is demonstrated that the SURF model provides useful
   simulation results and does outperform the URBAN model. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Knowledge about model uncertainty is essential for erosion modelling and
   provides important information when it comes to parameterizing models.
   In this paper a sensitivity analysis of the European soil erosion model
   (EUROSEM) is carried out using Monte Carlo simulation, suitable for
   complex non-linear models, using time-dependent driving variables. The
   analysis revealed some important characteristics of the model. The
   variability of the static output parameters was generally high, with the
   hydrologic parameters being the most important ones, especially
   saturated hydraulic conductivity and net capillary drive followed by the
   percentage basal area for the hydrological and vegetation parameters and
   detachability and cohesion for the soil erosion parameters. Overall,
   sensitivity to vegetation parameters was insignificant. The coefficient
   of variation for the sedigraph was higher than for the hydrograph,
   especially from the beginning of the rainstorm and up to the peak, and
   may explain difficulties encountered when trying to match simulated
   hydrographs and sedigraphs with observed ones. The findings from this
   Monte Carlo simulation calls for improved within-storm modelling of
   erosion processes in EUROSEM. Information about model uncertainty will
   be incorporated in a new EUROSEM user interface. Copyright (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{A sensitivity analysis of the surface and catchment characteristics in
   the European soil erosion model (EUROSEM) was carried out with special
   emphasis on rills and rock fragment cover. The analysis focused on the
   use of Monte Carlo simulation but was supplemented by a simple
   sensitivity analysis where input variables were increased and decreased
   by 10\%, The study showed that rock fragments have a significant effect
   upon the static output parameters of total runoff, peak flow rate, total
   soil loss and peak sediment discharge, but with a high coefficient of
   variation. The same applied to the average hydrographs and sedigraphs
   although the peak of the graphs was associated with a low coefficient of
   variation. On average, however, the model was able to simulate the
   effect of rock fragment cover quite well. The sensitivity analysis
   through the Monte Carlo simulation showed that the model is particularly
   sensitive to changes in parameters describing rills and the length of
   the plane when no rock fragments are simulated but that the model also
   is sensitive to changes in the Fraction of non-erodible material and
   interrill slope when rock fragments were embedded in the topsoil. For
   rock fragments resting on the surface, changes in parameter values did
   not affect model output significantly. The simple sensitivity analysis
   supported the findings from the Monte Carlo simulation and illustrates
   the importance when choosing input parameters to describe both rills and
   rock fragment cover when modelling with EUROSEM, Copyright (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{A conceptual water-balance model was modified from a point application
   to be distributed for evaluating the spatial distribution of watershed
   water balance based on daily precipitation, temperature and other
   hydrological parameters. The model was calibrated by comparing simulated
   daily variation in soil moisture with field observed data and results of
   another model that simulates the vertical soil moisture flow by
   numerically solving Richards' equation. The impacts of soil and land use
   on the hydrological components of the water balance, such as
   evapotranspiration, soil moisture deficit, runoff and subsurface
   drainage, were evaluated with the calibrated model in this study. Given
   the same meteorological conditions and land use, the soil moisture
   deficit, evapotranspiration and surface runoff increase, and subsurface
   drainage decreases, as the available water capacity of soil increases.
   Among various land uses, alfalfa produced high soil moisture deficit and
   evapotranspiration and lower surface runoff and subsurface drainage,
   whereas soybeans produced an opposite trend. The simulated distribution
   of various hydrological components shows the combined effect of soil and
   land use. Simulated hydrological components compare well with observed
   data. The study demonstrated that the distributed water balance approach
   is efficient and has advantages over the use of single average value of
   hydrological variables and the application at a single point in the
   traditional practice. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The estimation of erosion and sediment delivery rates in tropical
   mountain watersheds is difficult and most of the methods widely used for
   estimating soil erosion over large areas have serious limitations. The
   Cs-137 approach has potential for quantifying soil erosion because it
   can provide retrospective estimates of long-term (since 1963) net
   sediment redistribution relatively quickly. Despite its great potential,
   Cs-137 has not yet been used in an extensive, reconnaissance level
   survey of erosion in complex tropical mountain environments. The
   objective of this study was to examine the applicability of the Cs-137
   method to estimate erosion on steep tropical agricultural lands (23 to
   80\% slopes) in the Nizao watershed, a humid, tropical mountain area of
   the Dominican Republic. In this study we (i) examine the variation of
   Cs-137 in ten reference sites - eight coffee groves and two forested
   sites - and (ii) estimate erosion from 14 cultivated fields.
   The soil pool of Cs-137 ranged from to 150 to 192 mBq cm(-2) on
   reference sites with minimal erosion. Variability among reference sites
   was less than expected for such complex mountain terrain. The
   variability within coffee and forested reference (average CV = 28\%)
   sites was similar to the variability found on grassland and forested
   reference sites in the temperate zone.
   The estimated annual soil loss from 14 sampled fields ranged from 6 to
   61 t ha(-1) year(-1) with an overall mean of 26 t ha(-1) year(-1).
   Overall, the soil erosion estimates found using the Cs-137 method were
   much lower than those often assumed for such steep tropical hillsides.
   These erosion estimates account for soil loss since 1963 only and it
   seems likely that soil losses may have been much higher in earlier
   decades immediately after initial forest clearing earlier in the 20th
   century. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Small bounded plots were used to investigate dissolved nutrient losses
   in overland flow in eucalyptus and pine forests in northern Portugal
   following understorey fires. Losses of NO(3)(-)-N, PO(4)(3-), Ca(2+),
   Mg(2+) and K(+) were measured over 19 months during the first 2-3 years
   after fire. Solute losses in overland flow increased after fire in
   eucalyptus and pine terrain due to the mineralization of litter and
   vegetation and increased overland flow. The data suggest that (i)
   elevated losses persist for at least 2 and 3 years at the pine and
   eucalyptus sites respectively and (ii) soluble losses of PO(4)(3-) and
   K(+) in a post-fire cycle may exceed those adsorbed to eroded material,
   Losses of PO(4)(3-), although relatively small, are potentially the most
   detrimental to soil fertility and forest productivity because of the
   limited opportunity for P replenishment and correspondingly high P
   losses adsorbed to eroded sediment. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The fractal dimension of an individual flee is a measure of the
   complexity of its external shape. Fractal dimensions can also be used to
   characterize flee populations, in which case the fractal dimension
   indicates how the shape of the smaller flocs relates to that of the
   larger flocs. The objective of this study is to compare the fractal
   dimensions of flee populations with those of individual flocs, and to
   evaluate how well both indicate contributions of sediment sources and
   reflect the nature and extent of flocculation in streams.
   Suspended solids were collected prior to and during snowmelt at upstream
   and downstream sites in two southern Ontario streams with contrasting
   riparian zones. An image analysis system was used to determine area,
   longest axis and perimeter of flocs. The area-perimeter relationship was
   used to calculate the fractal dimension, D-i, that characterizes the
   flee population. For each sample, the fractal dimension, D-i, of the 28
   to 30 largest individual Aocs was determined from the
   perimeter-step-length relationship. Prior to snowmelt, the mean value of
   D-i ranged from 1.19 (Cedar Creek, downstream) to 1.22 (Strawberry
   Creek, upstream and downstream). A comparison of the means using t-tests
   indicates that most samples on this day had comparable mean values of
   D-i. During snowmelt, there was no significant change in the mean value
   of Di at the Cedar Creek sites. In contrast, for Strawberry Creek the
   mean value of D-i at both sites increased significantly, from 1.22 prior
   to snowmelt to 1.34 during snowmelt. This increase reflects the
   contribution of sediment-laden overland flow to the sediment load. At
   three of the sampling sites, the increase in fractal dimensions was
   accompanied by a decreases in effective particle size, which can be
   explained by an increase in bed shear stress. A comparison of fractal
   dimensions of individual flocs in a sample with the fractal dimensions
   of the floc populations indicates that both fractal dimensions provide
   similar information about the temporal changes in sediment source
   contributions, about the contrasting effectiveness of the riparian
   buffer zones in the two basins, and about the hydraulic conditions in
   the streams. Nevertheless, determining the individual fractal dimensions
   of a set of large flocs in a sample is very time consuming. Using
   fractal dimensions of flee populations is therefore the preferred method
   to characterize suspended matter. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The interception storage capacity has been measured for a range of
   dryland plants. Interception losses over time, however, arise in rain
   events that deliver either less or more than the canopy capacity. The
   fate of water in these cases depends on the efficiency with which the
   intercepted water is returned to the atmosphere by evaporation from the
   plant canopies. Two primary methods to estimate interception losses are
   (i) calibrated process-based models of interception and evaporative loss
   and (ii) direct measurement. Models have been applied only rarely to
   dryland plant communities, and direct measurement techniques are in need
   of additional testing and refinement. Most published estimates of
   interception loss in dryland plant communities therefore appear to be
   based upon inadequate data and methods. Research needs in this area are
   highlighted. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Several sediment cores were collected from two proglacial lakes in the
   vicinity of Mittivakkat Glacier, southeast Greenland, in order to
   determine sedimentation rates, estimate sediment yields and identify the
   dominant sources of the lacustrine sediment. The presence of varves in
   the ice-dammed Icefall Lake enabled sedimentation rates to be estimated
   using a combination of X-ray photography and down-core variations in
   Cs-137 activity. Sedimentation rates for individual cores ranged between
   0.52 and 1.06 g cm(-2) year(-1), and the average sedimentation rate was
   estimated to be 0.79 g cm(-2) year(-1). Despite considerable down-core
   variability in annual sedimentation rates, there is no significant trend
   over the period 1970 to 1994. After correcting for autochthonous organic
   matter content and trap efficiency, the mean fine-grained minerogenic
   sediment yield from the 3.8 km(2) basin contributing to the lake was
   estimated to be 327 t km(-2) year(-1). Cores were also collected from
   the topset beds of two small deltas in Icefall Lake. The deposition of
   coarse-grained sediment on the delta surface was estimated to total in
   excess of 15 cm over the last c. 40 years. In the larger Lake Kuutuaq,
   which is located about 5 km from the glacier front and for which the
   glacier represents a smaller proportion of the contributing catchment,
   sedimentation rates determined for six cores collected from the centre
   of the lake, based on their Cs-137 depth profiles, were estimated to
   range between 0.05 and 0.11 g cm(-2) year(-1), and the average was 0.08
   g cm(-2) year(-1). The longer-term (c. 100-150 years) average
   sedimentation rate for one of the cores, estimated from its unsupported
   Pb-210 profile, was 0.10-0.13 g cm(-2) year(-1), suggesting that
   sedimentation rates in this lake have been essentially constant over the
   last c. 100-150 years. The average fine-grained sediment yield from the
   32.4 km(2) catchment contributing to the lake was estimated to be 13 t
   km(-2) year(-1). The Cs-137 depth profiles for cores collected from the
   topset beds of the delta of Lake Kuutuaq indicate that in excess of 27
   cm of coarse-grained sediment had accumulated on the delta surface over
   the last approximately 40 years. Caesium-137 concentrations associated
   with the most recently deposited (uppermost) hue-grained sediment in
   both Icefall Lake and Lake Kuutuaq were similar to those measured in
   fine-grained sediment collected from steep slopes in the immediate
   proglacial zone, suggesting that this material, rather than contemporary
   glacial debris, is the most likely source of the sediment deposited in
   the lakes. This finding is confirmed by the Cs-137 concentrations
   associated with suspended sediment collected from the Mittivakkat
   stream, which are very similar to those for proglacial material.

Abstract = {{Two tracer experiments have been carried out at an enclosed catchment in
   southern Norway. The catchment was brought to steady state with respect
   to rainfall and runoff prior to the tracer addition. A known
   concentration of lithium bromide was then added to the rainfall for the
   duration of each event. The tight control on tracer concentration and
   rainfall amount enabled assessment of the contribution of old and new
   water to runoff, the dominant flow pathways and soil water residence
   times during a storm event. A significant volume of `old' water
   contributes to runoff despite the hydrologically responsive nature of
   the catchment and several hours of tracer injected rainfall are required
   before `new' water becomes the dominant runoff source. After 34 h of
   tracer injection,'new' water apparently contributes c. 83\% to
   instantaneous flow and c. 55\% of the total tracer input to the
   catchment has been lost in runoff. Recovery of the tracer from soil
   water indicates that the organic soil surface layer is the dominant flow
   pathway for rainwater through the catchment and that a significant
   pathway also exists at the soil-bedrock interface. New water is retained
   in deep pockets of soil for several days. Assessment of the conservative
   behaviour of the tracer suggests that 10-14\% of the input Br- is
   retained in the soil and the tracer is not conservative. Laboratory
   experiments indicate that sorption of Br- to organic soil is the likely
   mechanism of retention. This process is probably concentration dependent
   and will have occurred predominantly during the initial period of tracer
   application. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Preferential flow pathways, such as soil pipes, are usually present in
   the soil of slopes. Subsurface flow through the soil pipes affects the
   subsurface drainage system and is responsible for sediment removal from
   slopes. However, a record of the inner structure of soil pipes has
   rarely been reported for slopes. A fibrescope examination of the
   morphology and flow phases in soil pipes in hillslopes underlain by a
   Quaternary sand-gravel formation provided the following information: the
   main pores of the soil pipes ran mostly parallel with the slope
   gradient; the cross-sections of the soil pipes were approximately
   circular; and occurred on a few occasions; with some triple junctions
   being present. In addition, both full flow and partly full-depth
   conditions occurred simultaneously in the soil pipe. The full flow
   condition has long been used in hydrological studies to model the pipe
   flow mechanism. Both the full flow condition and the partly full-depth
   condition, however, must be examined closely in order to evaluate the
   subsurface hydrology in heterogeneous soil and the hydrogeomorphological
   processes of subsurface hydraulic erosion. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley

Abstract = {{This work has been carried out within the framework of NOPEX - a
   NOrthern hemisphere climate Processes land surface EXperiment. Its
   purpose is to describe the spatial variability of groundwater levels and
   soil moisture content and their influence on runoff generation in small
   catchments in a landscape dominated by boreal forest and till soils,
   which is characteristic for the Nordic countries. Kinematic wave
   approximations have been used to describe saturated subsurface flow and
   saturation overland flow in hillslopes with a thin soil layer overlying
   a relatively impermeable bedrock. Simultaneous analyses of catchment
   runoff, groundwater-table depths and soil moisture in the unsaturated
   zone have been performed by including the kinematic wave descriptions in
   a precipitation-runoff model. The results have been compared with
   observed hydrographs and spatial patterns of groundwater levels and soil
   moisture content in two small experimental catchments. Results from this
   study indicate that is reasonable to apply the same parameter set when
   describing hydrological processes in computational elements with similar
   characteristics at a scale of about 1 km(2) in the NOPEX area. Copyright

Abstract = {{The hydrology of oxygen-18 (O-18) isotopes was monitored between 1995
   and 1998 in the Allt a' Mharcaidh catchment in the Cairngorm Mountains,
   Scotland. Precipitation (mean delta(18)O = -7.69 parts per thousand)
   exhibited strong seasonal variation in delta(18)O values over the study
   period, ranging from -2.47 parts per thousand in the summer to -20.93
   parts per thousand in the winter months. As expected, such variation was
   substantially damped in stream waters, which had a mean and range of
   delta(18)O of -9.56 parts per thousand and -8.45 to -10.44 parts per
   thousand, respectively. Despite this, oxygen-is proved a useful tracer
   and streamwater delta(18)O variations could be explained in terms of a
   two-component mixing model, involving a seasonally variable delta(18)O
   signature in storm runoff, mixing with groundwater characterized by
   relatively stable delta(18)O levels. Variations in soil water delta(18)O
   implied the routing of depleted spring snowmelt and enriched summer
   rainfall into streamwaters, probably by near-surface hydrological
   pathways in peaty soils. The relatively stable isotope composition of
   baseflows is consistent with effective mixing processes in shallow
   aquifers at the catchment scale. Examination of the seasonal variation
   in delta(18)O levels in various catchment waters provided a first
   approximation of mean residence times in the major hydrological stores.
   Preliminary estimates are 0.2-0.8 years for near-surface soil water that
   contributes to storm runoff and 2 and > 5 years for shallow and deeper
   groundwater, respectively. These O-18 data sets provide further evidence
   that the influence of groundwater on the hydrology and hydrochemistry of
   upland catchments has been underestimated. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley

Abstract = {{A rainfall interception measuring system was developed and tested for
   open-grown trees. The system includes direct measurements of gross
   precipitation, throughfall and stemflow, as well as continuous
   collection of micrometeorological data. The data were sampled every
   second and collected at 30-s time steps using pressure transducers
   monitoring water depth in collection containers coupled to Campbell CR10
   dataloggers. The system was tested on a 9-year-old broadleaf deciduous
   tree (pear, Pyrus calleryana `Bradford') and an 8-year-old broadleaf
   evergreen tree (cork oak, Quercus suber) representing trees having
   divergent canopy distributions of foliage and stems. Partitioning of
   gross precipitation into throughfall, stemflow and canopy interception
   is presented for these two mature open-grown trees during the 1996-1998
   rainy seasons. Interception losses accounted for about 15\% of gross
   precipitation for the pear tree and 27\% for the oak tree. The fraction
   of gross precipitation reaching the ground included 8\% by stemflow and
   77\% by throughfall for the pear tree, as compared with 15\% and 58\%,
   respectively, for the oak tree. The analysis of temporal patterns in
   interception indicates that it was greatest at the beginning of each
   rainfall event. Rainfall frequency is more significant than rainfall
   rate and duration in determining interception losses. Both stemflow and
   throughfall varied with rainfall intensity and wind speed. Increasing
   precipitation rates and wind speed increased stemflow but reduced
   throughfall. Analysis of rainfall interception processes at different
   time-scales indicates that canopy interception varied from 100\% at the
   beginning of the rain event to about 3\% at the maximum rain intensity
   for the oak tree. These values reflected the canopy surface water
   storage changes during the rain event. The winter domain precipitation
   at our study site in the Central Valley of California limited our
   opportunities to collect interception data during non-winter seasons.
   This precipitation pattern makes the results more specific to the
   Mediterranean climate region. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{A simple conceptual hydrological model that explicitly includes the
   lateral movement of soil water and operates efficiently at the landscape
   scale is outlined. It is applied to five areas of ecological interest in
   the UK to provide distributed mean monthly soil moisture on a 50 m grid.
   As the model's driving variables - daily rainfall and potential
   evapotranspiration - are assumed constant over each of the tracts of
   land, the variability in soil moisture is due to different soil types
   and to topographic effects. Box plots of the mean monthly simulated soil
   moisture clearly show the spread of values occasioned by modelling the
   lateral water movement down the hillslope. The general magnitude of the
   results are compared with published data wherever possible and there is
   some discussion of the form of the curve used in the model to describe
   the attenuation of evapotranspiration with decreasing soil moisture.

Abstract = {{Effectively managing groundwater relies heavily on estimating the amount
   of precipitation that may infiltrate the subsurface and supply
   groundwater. In this study, we present a novel estimation method based
   on a stochastic approach to evaluate the quantity of precipitation that
   may recharge groundwater. The precipitation recharge coefficient is also
   investigated based on an unconfined aquifer with an unbound, infinitely
   extended boundary condition. Moreover, a spectrum's relationship to the
   precipitation and groundwater level variation is also derived. The
   precipitation recharge coefficient can be obtained from the solution of
   the spectrum equation. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is performed in
   order to determine the key Variable on the precipitation recharge
   coefficient. Analysis results indicate that the location of an
   observation well affects the estimated precipitation recharge
   coefficient. If the precipitation recharge area is large enough, the
   precipitation recharge coefficient becomes insensitive to the location
   of the observation well. The spectrum's relationship between the
   precipitation recharge and groundwater level variation is also applied
   when estimating the precipitation recharge coefficient upstream of the
   Cho-Shui River alluvial fan. According to those results, the
   precipitation recharge coefficient is 0.03 and the amount of groundwater
   recharge from precipitation is 35 million tons of water annually
   upstream of the Cho-Shui River alluvial fan. Copyright (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{Headwater catchments are sources of sediments, nutrients, and biota for
   larger streams, yet the hydrologic pathways that transport these
   materials remain unclear. Dynamics of stormflow generation related to
   landform attributes and antecedent rainfall were investigated in a steep
   forested headwater catchment at Hitachi Ohta Experimental Watershed,
   Japan. Such headwater catchments are deeply incised: the narrow riparian
   corridors have limited capacities to store and transmit water to
   streams. Storm runoff was monitored at several nested scales within the
   catchment: (1) 2.48 ha first-order drainage (FB); (2) incipient 0.84 ha
   first-order drainage (FA) comprized of two zero-order basins; (3) 0.25
   ha zero-order basin (ZB); and (4) 45 m(2) hillslope segment (HS),
   including subsurface matrix flow (MF) and preferential flow (PF).
   Results from applied tracer and staining tests as well as observations
   of piezometric, tensiometric, and subsurface temperature responses were
   also employed to elucidate hydrologic pathways during storms. During the
   driest conditions, water yield from FB was only 1\%; runoff occurred as
   saturated overland flow from the small riparian zone and direct channel
   interception. For slightly wetter conditions, subsurface flow from the
   soil matrix augmented stormflow. As wetness increased, two significant
   non-linear hydrologic responses occurred: (I) threshold response in
   geomorphic hollows (zero-order basins) where runoff initiated after an
   accumulation of shallow groundwater; and (2) self-organization and
   expansion of preferential flow pathways, which facilitate subsurface
   drainage. Stormflow increases observed during periods of increasing
   antecedent wetness depend upon temporal and spatial linkages and the
   unique hydrologic behavior of three components: (1) narrow riparian
   corridors; (2) linear hillslopes; and (3) geomorphic hollows. These
   linkages form the basis for an emerging hydrogeomorphic concept of
   stormflow generation for steep forested headwaters. Knowledge of
   stormflow response is critical to the assessment of management practices
   in these headwater areas as well as the routing of water and materials
   to larger stream systems. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to evaluate the relative contribution of a zero-order
   basin to runoff generation in a headwater catchment as well as to
   elucidate internal factors affecting hydrological response. Runoff,
   piezometric heads, and soil temperatures were measured for a 0.25 ha
   zero-order basin (ZB) together with discharges from an adjacent 0.84 ha
   Ist-order basin (FA) and a larger 2.48 ha Ist-order basin (FB) which
   includes both ZB and FA. Data collected over a year showed ZB
   contributed to runoff generation in FB at three different levels. While
   continuous runoff was recorded from both FB and FA, no substantial
   runoff was measured for ZB during dry conditions when discharge from FB
   < 0.5 mm d(-1) (level 0: no contribution). For wetter conditions above
   this threshold, the ZB augmented stormflow and the discharge ratios of
   ZB to FB (on a unit area basis) increased rapidly from zero up to unity
   with increasing wetness (level 1: non-linear contribution). During the
   wettest periods when discharge from FB > 5 mm d(-1), all three basins
   generated runoff of the same order per unit area (level 2: linear
   contribution). Piezometers installed above the soil-bedrock interface
   (0.5 to 1.2 m depth) along the longitudinal axis of ZB responded only in
   the lower locations when runoff from ZB much less than discharge from
   FB. Conversely, the major runoff contribution from ZB to the discharge
   from FB generally coincided with a large piezometric rise near the head
   hollow. Soil temperatures in the head hollow fluctuated even during some
   rainstorms, indicating that such a large piezometric rise ias caused by
   a convergent subsurface flow from the further upslope. Thus, shallow
   groundwater, which developed above the trough of ZB, would not always
   extend from the base to the upslope but may appear simultaneously in the
   head hollow. This additional contribution due to upslope topography may
   create additional variability and non-linearity in runoff response from
   ZB relative to planar hillslopes. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Most physically-based hydrological models rely on either spatially
   distributed or lumped characterizations of topography and other spatial
   variations. Three disturbed hydrological models with different
   treatments of topography, namely the MIKE SHE, TOPMODEL and GB model
   (geomorphology-based hydrological model) are discussed in this paper. A
   regular square grid system is used by MIKE SHE for representation of
   catchment spatial variability and as the fundamental computation units.
   TOPMODEL characterizes the topography using a distributed topographic
   index, In(a/tan beta). The areas with the same In(a/tan beta) are
   assumed to be hydrologically similar. Then, the catchment is divided
   into a number of segments corresponding to the topographic index
   intervals. The GB model employs the catchment area function and width
   function to lump the topography and divide the catchment into a series
   of flow interval-hillslopes. The catchment spatial variations are
   averaged over each flow interval and represented by one-dimensional
   distribution functions with respect to the flow distance from the
   catchment outlet. The hillslope elements are the fundamental
   computational units in the GB model. The above three models are applied
   to the Seki River in Japan. The model structure and performance are
   compared and discussed in the paper. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{An artificial Neural Network (NN) was successfully applied, in an
   earlier study, as a prediction tool to forecast water level at Dhaka
   (Bangladesh), for up to seven lead days in advance, with a high accuracy
   level. In addition, this high accuracy degree was accompanied with a
   very short computational time. Both make NN a desirable advance warming
   forecasting tool. In a later study, a sensitivity analysis was also
   performed to retain only the most sensitive gauging stations for the
   Dhaka station. The resulting reduction of gauging stations
   insignificantly affects the prediction accuracy level.
   The work concerning the possibility of measurement failure in any of the
   gauging stations during the critical flow lever at Dhaka requires
   prediction tools which can interpret linguistic assessment of flow
   levels. A fuzzy logic approach is introduced with two or three
   membership functions, depending on necessity, for the input stations
   with five membership functions for the output station. Membership
   functions for each station are derived from their respective water revel
   frequency distributions, after the Kohonen neural network is used to
   group the data into clusters. The proposed approach in deriving
   membership function shows a number of advances over the approach
   commonly used. When prediction results are compared with measured data,
   the prediction accuracy level is comparable with that of the data driven
   neural network approach. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{With the aim of realizing a surface-subsurface-coupled fluid flow
   simulation, the authors discuss surface flow models that can be used in
   the framework of the 2-phase subsurface numerical simulation system. In
   this paper, three surface flow models, i.e., a kinematic wave model
   (KW), a diffusion wave model (DW), and a linearized diffusion wave model
   (LDW), are explained by approximating the momentum equation, and are
   transformed into a set of nonlinear functions which can be solved
   simultaneously with the 2-phase subsurface flow. By incorporating these
   into a 2-phase numerical simulation system, comparison studies are
   carried out using experimental data and a held scale model. So far as
   the results of the study are concerned, it is concluded that the DW
   model gives reasonable performance for any case, the LDW model provides
   mostly identical results with the DW model with some restrictions, while
   the KW model is not applicable for the physical modelling of continuous

Abstract = {{A dynamic-stochastic model for flood forecasting based on the Kalman
   filtering theory is described. To reduce the computational time that the
   Kalman filter involves, this model is performed using the reduced rank
   square root algorithm, which approximates the covariance matrix by a
   matrix of lower rank. By using the special banded structure of the
   Jacobian matrix of the discretization of the Saint Venant equations by
   the four points Preissman scheme, this algorithm is made computationally
   efficient for a flood routing model. The noise terms are treated as
   coloured noise processes, with one term for every grid element. An
   application to estimate the state of a one-channel reach is described.

Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{521-538}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{For the purpose of characterizing spatial variability of soil hydraulic
   properties on a forested hillslope, five differing scaling methods were
   examined using the data set for 30 undisturbed forest soils: scaling of
   water retention curves, scaling of hydraulic conductivity curves, and
   simultaneous scaring of both water retention and conductivity curves.
   For the scaling of conductivity curves and the simultaneous scaling, the
   soil-pore-tortuosity parameter in a conductivity model was either fixed
   at a constant or treated as a fitted parameter. Results showed that the
   set of scaling factors and reference parameters derived by the separate
   scaling of water retention curves was different from that derived by the
   separate scaling of conductivity curves. Moreover, the separate scaling
   methods resulted in large estimation errors in either effective
   saturation or conductivity. Optimizing the tortuosity parameter was
   effective in improving scaling results. It was concluded that the
   simultaneous scaling with a fitted pore-tortuosity parameter was the
   best among the five methods tested in this study. The obtained scaling
   factors obeyed the lognormal distribution rather than the normal
   distribution. The variance of log-transformed scaling factors at the
   forested hillslope was larger than those at many crop fields studied by
   previous studies. While a spatial dependence of soil hydraulic
   properties was suggested for the surface layer of the forested
   hillslope, hydraulic properties of the subsurface layer exhibited large
   variations even in a small distance. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The delta(18)O and delta D in 17 river waters flowing into and out of
   Lake Biwa, the lake water itself and precipitation at 11 locations in
   the Lake Biwa basin were observed from October 1996 to September 1997,
   to evaluate the origin of river waters and the effect of irrigation
   water from the lake on the river waters flowing into Lake Biwa. The
   regional difference and altitude effect of the stable isotopes in
   precipitation and river water were found in the basin. The delta(18)O in
   the rivers which are located in the eastern and the southern areas in
   the basin is heavier than that of the other rivers, due to the effect of
   irrigation for the nearby paddy fields. Evaporation from Lake Biwa and
   the inflow rate into the lake estimated from the delta(18)O balance
   agree well with the results of previous studies which used water balance
   methods. The stable isotopes can enable us to evaluate not only water
   balance but also the origin of the water and the water flow system.

Abstract = {{Lake Abashiri (surface area 32.87 km(2); maximum depth 16.2-16.5 m) is
   consistently stratified by the lower anoxic saline layer (salinity 14-20
   parts per thousand; dissolved oxygen less than 0.1\% Sat.). Behaviours
   of the lower saline water are investigated by continuously and
   vertically measuring flow velocity, salinity and water temperature, and
   by observing meteorology, river discharge, lake level, sea level and
   water properties. During the period of flow measurement (June-August
   1997), the sea level remained higher than the lake level except for a
   neap tide of 12-15 June and two large rainfall discharges of the upper
   Abashiri River of 10-15 August. Consequently, seawater intrusion from
   the lot-ver Abashiri River occurred almost daily except for these two
   periods. Longitudinal distributions of salinity, water temperature and
   turbidity in the lake indicate that a density underflow initiated from
   the seawater intrusion is bifurcated into an interflow and an underflow
   at the halocline. Meanwhile, in a shallow region on the opposite side of
   the seawater entrance, the harocline becomes unclear with the unstable
   density structure in the lower layer. This is probably due to the
   entrainment of saline water by downwelling currents in the lower saline
   layer, which coincide with wind-driven vertical circulation in the upper
   layer. Spectral analyses of flow velocity (1-6 cm s(-1)), temperature,
   and salinity in the lower layer, and of wind velocity, revealed that
   daily cyclic winds or diurnal southward winds with no nocturnal winds
   induce irrotational water motions in the lower layer with a period of
   21.3 or 25.6 hrs. It was also found that the internal seiche: of the
   first mode is dominant with periods of 6 to 7 hrs during a blowing time
   of more than 2 days by a one-directional weak wind (maximum speed of 4 m
   s(-1)) or after a blowing time of more than half a day by a relatively
   strong wind of more than 5 m s(-1). Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{A simultaneous solution for one-dimensional unsteady flow routing for a
   network of rivers has been developed, which can be used either with a
   complete distributed hydrological model, a simple rainfall-runoff model
   or as a stand alone river routing model. Either dynamic or kinematic
   solution schemes can be selected to simulate the river flows. The river
   network is either generated from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) or
   directly input to the model. The model can handle any number of upstream
   channels and computational points. A sparse matrix solution algorithm is
   used to solve the 2N x 2N matrix resulting from N nodes in the network.
   A submodule generates the initial water depth and discharge at each
   computational point from equilibrium discharge in the absence of
   observed initial conditions. The model is applied in three
   sub-catchments of the Chao Phraya river basin, Thailand, considering
   three different conditions. The simulated results show good agreement
   with observed discharges and provide insight to water level
   fluctuations, especially where tributaries join the main channel.

Abstract = {{In order to forecast the effects of global warming on the water
   environment, the relationship between meteorological conditions and lake
   water quality was investigated statistically using 17 years of
   monitoring data obtained from a shallow eutrophic lake, Lake
   Kasumigaura. The usefulness of the DPY (difference from the previous
   year) method was confirmed for removing the watershed change (e.g. land
   cover, population, etc.). From the analysis of the relationships between
   air temperature and water temperature on a monthly basis, the delay of
   time was seen to be negligible, but the gain was reduced due to the high
   frequency of change. As the amount of precipitation affected their
   relationship on a yearly basis, the slopes of 1.0-1.2 degrees C water
   temperature/degrees C air temperature were determined with the DPY
   method by excluding the combinations of the years having large
   difference in annual precipitation. The deterioration of lake water
   quality, such as increases in COD (chemical oxygen demand) and decreases
   in transparency, was quantitatively assessed as corresponding to an
   increase in air temperature. In addition, we found that higher
   precipitation led to high nitrogen concentrations on a monthly basis, as
   well as on a yearly basis, probably induced by both the runoff of
   soilwater having high concentrations and the lowering of residence times
   of lake water. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Flooded area and flood hazard assessment in Bangladesh were evaluated
   using remote sensing (RS) data with the geographical information system
   (GIS). Image data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)
   were used to analyse Bangladesh's historical flood event of 1988, which
   sets a hundred-year record for the inundated areas, with severe damage
   occurring throughout this region. Cloudy skies often occur during big
   floods, and visible and infrared rays observed by the NOAA AVHRR cannot
   penetrate cloud cover. We therefore proposed a new algorithm for
   classifying cloud covered pixels into water or non-water categories. In
   order to estimate the flooded area accurately, the images taken during
   the flood and dry season which were classified into water and non-water
   categories were superimposed. A new flood hazard map, created from the
   land cover category and elevation height data which were ranked by flood
   affected frequency, can be used to evaluate flood risk using only RS
   data and elevation height data. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Major issues of urban drainage are coping with flooding caused by
   torrential downpours and water pollution caused by washing loads from
   non-point sources. Large-scale trunk sewers and pumping stations are
   constructed in large Japanese cities. To reduce both types of damage due
   to floods and water pollution, these sewerage systems should have
   additional functions of storage and treatment of the washing loads. In
   such a case, pump operations have a key role for the reduction of
   damage. However, perfect observation of the state of the system is
   difficult since continuous observation of water levels and/or water flow
   in all the points of the sewers is necessary. Hence, we cannot use
   operation optimization techniques which require perfect observation of
   the system. In a certain condition, several stochastic optimization
   techniques only require partial state observations: systems equations
   and observation equations are both linear, the objective function is
   quadratic and the time-horizon of the problem is finite. Although there
   may be cases where these assumptions hold, it is hard to obtain an
   optimal operation policy of pumping stations in urban inner-drainage
   systems using these optimization techniques, since observation
   equations, at least, are non-linear in most situations. This paper
   focuses on this partial observability of states for pump operation
   problems in sewerage systems. A practical method to design pump
   operation optimization and an evaluation method of the performance on
   the reduction of damage by implementing another monitoring station to
   the system are introduced. A numerical example is also presented to
   illustrate how the proposed method works. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley

Abstract = {{A macro-scale hydrological analysis of the Lena River basin, located in
   eastern Siberia, Russia was carried out to understand both physical and
   biological roles in a cold region. A combined model which is composed of
   a SVAT model, runoff model and river routing model was proposed to
   explain snowmelt, evapotranspiration, thawing and freezing of
   permafrost, runoff formation and river flow. Two kinds of grid sizes
   were prepared for the combined model, in which a 1 degrees x 1 degrees
   grid is used for the SVAT model and runoff model, and a 0.1 degrees x
   0.1 degrees grid for the river routing model. Both of them were averaged
   from GLOBE (NOAA, 1997). The river network was built up using digital
   elevation data of 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees with the river discharge
   flow going to the largest difference in altitude of the surrounding
   eight grid points. Routine meteorological data at each 1 degrees x 1
   degrees grid over the basin were derived by spatial interpolation using
   observed data from forty meteorological stations. The analysed duration
   was set from October 1986 to September 1987. The results are as follows:
   The annual amount of estimated precipitation of the basin ranges from
   100 mm to 900 mm. The area of over 400 mm is distributed mainly over the
   southeastern mountain area. The estimated evapotranspiration of the
   basin presents a clear grid distribution, the annual amount is larger
   than 200 mm in the most southern part and is less than 150 mm in the
   northern part. In spite of the fact that evapotranspiration in the
   southern part is large, the southern part of the basin becomes a
   sufficient region of runoff yield due to the large annual precipitation
   compared to the northern part. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Hydrological models can benefit from satellite-derived digital elevation
   models (DEMs) only after determining the hydrological model sensitivity
   to DEM inaccuracies. This study examined how vertical errors within a
   SPOT satellite-derived DEM of the 532 km(2) Little Washita River, OK,
   watershed affected hydrological predictions in the TOPLATS
   (topographically based land-atmosphere transfer scheme) water and energy
   balance model. Model predictions based on SPOT-derived DEM inputs were
   compared with US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute level 1 and level 2
   DEM-based predictions to determine model sensitivity. Ten-year
   simulation runs using a statistical formulation of TOPLATS indicated
   that while DEM inaccuracies had little effect on basin average output,
   they had a significant effect on the upper and lower quartiles of
   predicted water table depth. In 12-day simulation runs using a spatially
   explicit formulation of TOPLATS, which used 30-m grid cells across a 600
   000 pixel model domain, elevation errors propagated into model
   predictions of soil moisture, runoff, evapotranspiration, incoming solar
   radiation and surface skin temperature. Aggregation of the 30-m pixel
   model output to scales of 0.25 km(2), however, reduced differences
   between model-predicted vadose zone hydrology. Agreement between
   model-predicted water table hydrology was achieved at much larger scales
   of 5 km(2), indicating that topography and its associated error
   structure may have a greater influence on saturated rather than
   unsaturated hydrological modelling. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

   below George Lake), the Roger's Brook Basin, Moosepit Brook, and for
   other selected locations at and near Kejimkujik National Park in Nova

   precipitation train, snow, fog), air temperature, stream discharge,
   snowpack accumulations, throughfall, soil and subsoil moisture, soil
   temperature and soil frost, at a monthly resolution. it was found that
   monthly per hectare stream discharge was essentially independent of
   catchment area from <20 km(2) to more than 1000 km(2). The forest
   hydrology model ForHyM2 was used to simulate monthly rates of stream
   discharge, throughfall and snowpack water equivalents for mature forest
   conditions. These simulations were in good agreement with the historical
   records once the contributions of fog and mist to the area-wide water
   budget were taken into account, each on a monthly basis. The resulting
   simulations establish a hydrologically consistent, continuous,
   comprehensive and partially verified record for basin-wide outcomes for

Abstract = {{Many remaining areas of tropical rainforest in south-east Asia are
   located on landscapes dominated by deep valleys and very steep slopes.
   Now that logging activities are extending into these steeplands, it is
   essential to understand how the natural rainforest system behaves if any
   kind of realistic assessment of the effects of such disturbance is to be
   made. This paper examines the hydrological behaviour of an undisturbed
   rainforest system on steep topography in the Temburong District of
   Brunei, north-west Borneo. The physical and hydrological properties of
   the regolith material are generally typical of tropical residual soils.
   The regolith has a day texture and a low dry bulk density beneath a
   superficial litter/organic horizon. The infiltration capacity of the
   surface soil was several hundred mm h(-1). That of the exposed mineral
   subsoil was an order of magnitude less, similar to the saturated
   hydraulic conductivity (K(sat)) of around 180 mm h(-1) at a depth of 150
   cm. There was no indication that K(sat) reduced with depth except very
   near the bedrock interface.
   Soil tensions were measured using a two-dimensional array of
   tensiometers on a 30 degrees slope. During dry season conditions,
   infiltrating rain-water contributes to soil moisture, and drying of the
   soil is dominated by transpiration losses, During wet season conditions,
   perched water tables quickly develop during heavy rainfall, giving rise
   to the rapid production of return flow in ephemeral channels. No
   infiltration excess or saturation overland flow was observed on
   hillslopes away from channel margins. Subsurface storm flow combined
   with return flow produce stream how hydrographs with high peak
   discharges and very short lag times. Storm event runoff coefficients are
   estimated to be as high as 40\%. It is concluded that the most
   distinctive feature of the hydrology of this `steepland rainforest' is
   the extremely `flashy' nature of the catchment runoff regime produced by
   the combination of thin but very permeable regolith on steep slopes.

Abstract = {{A method for regional assessment of the distribution of saline outbreaks
   is demonstrated for a large area (68 000 km(2)) in north Queensland,
   Australia. Soil samples were used in conjunction with a digital
   elevation model and a map of potentially saline discharge zones to
   examine the landscape distribution of soluble salts in the region. The
   hypothesis of atmospheric accession of salt was tested for the
   topographically defined catchment regions feeding into each potentially
   saline discharge area. Most catchments showed a salt distribution
   consistent with this hypothesis, i.e. \%TSS was large near the discharge
   areas and decreased rapidly with distance uphill from the discharge
   areas. In some catchments, however, local saline outbreaks were apparent
   at significant distances uphill from discharge areas. The possibility of
   geological sources of this salt was examined by comparing random point
   distributions with the location of saline points with distance downhill
   from geological units (excluding points near discharge zones). The
   distribution of some saline outbreaks was consistent with the occurrence
   of Cambro-Ordovician metasediments, Devonian limestone, Upper
   Devonian-Lower Carboniferous volcanics, and Triassic sediments.

Abstract = {{Forest transpiration models have been developed in different disciplines
   such as plant physiology, ecology, meteorology, hydrology and soil
   science. In the present study, three different types of model
   perspectives for transpiration control are used: leaf cooling, CO2
   assimilation and the combined energy and water balance. All three
   process-orientated models are calibrated on measurements in a Douglas
   fir stand in the Netherlands. The performances of these models are
   equally good, although they have different complexities, different
   numbers of calibration parameters (ranging from 1 to 6) and the models
   are calibrated on different measurements teddy correlation at canopy
   level or CO2 measurements at leaf level). The resemblance of the model
   results is caused by the calibration procedure and by the high impact of
   radiation in all three cases. Significant discrepancies become apparent
   when differences between model responses are examined and when specific
   (short) periods are selected when input variables are uncoupled. The
   main differences between the models are caused by another formulation of
   leaf area index and vapour pressure deficit (VPD). Considerable
   differences in simulated transpiration occur in the afternoon as a
   result of the diurnal hysteresis between VPD and radiation. Copyright

Abstract = {{The effects of solution pH, sediment dose, contact time, and particle
   size on the adsorption of cadmium ions on bed sediments have been
   studied for a highly polluted river in western Uttar Pradesh, India. The
   role of the coarser sediment and the clay and silt fractions has been
   examined. The optimum contact time needed to reach equilibrium is of the
   order of 30 and 60 min for 0-75 mu m and 210-250 mu m sediment size,
   respectively. The extent of cadmium adsorption increases with increasing
   pH and adsorbent doses and decreases with adsorbent particle size. The
   important geochemical phases, iron and manganese oxide, provide the
   active support material for the adsorption of cadmium. The competitive
   experiments conducted in the presence of lead and zinc ions indicate
   that both the ions suppress the ability of cadmium to adsorb on to
   sediments. The Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models were used to
   determine the mechanistic parameters associated with the adsorption
   process. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments have been conducted to study the effects of
   various rain properties on sand detachment resulting from raindrop
   impact. Splash cups were exposed to simulated rainfall intensities
   ranging between 10 and 140 mm h(-1). The detached sand was collected and
   weighed whereas rain intensity, equivalent drop diameter and fall
   velocity of raindrops were measured with an optical spectro-pluviometer
   (OSP). The properties of the simulated rain (i.e, median volume diameter
   and kinetic energy) were compared with those observed in natural
   conditions. Statistical analyses have been undertaken in order to
   evaluate which rain variable best predicts the mass of sand detached.
   Linear and non-linear correlations between the mass of detached sediment
   and the product of drop size (d) by drop velocity (v), i.e.
   (DVbeta)-V-alpha, with values of alpha varying between 1 and 6 and beta
   between 0 and 3, have been computed. The results indicate that the
   coefficient of determination (R-2) for alpha ranging between 3 and 5 and
   beta lower or equal to 2 are satisfying. Although kinetic energy
   ((DV2)-V-3) described splash detachment relatively well, the product of
   momentum by drop diameter (D-4 V) was slightly superior in describing
   splash detachment. Therefore, the momentum multiplied by the drop
   diameter is recommended as the best rain Variable to describe splash
   detachment. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Because the biogeochemical cycles of P and Si in temperate lakes are
   strongly connected by the dynamics of primary producers, it should be
   possible to influence the former cycle by causing changes in the latter.
   It is shown using the mathematical model `Rostherne' that winter levels
   of ambient Si have a major influence both on spring levels of ambient P
   and on the summer cyanobacterial maxima. Additions of Si to the lakes
   could be used for the fine regulation of the biogeochemical balance and
   may prescribe a recipe for improvement of water quality, as well as a

Abstract = {{The Ganga-Mahawa sub-basin, which has an area of 1280 km(2) forms the
   western part of the Central Ganga Plain in the Moradabad and Badaun
   districts of western Uttar Pradesh, India. The Bundelkhand granite forms
   the basement complex, overlain unconformably by the upper Vindhyan
   sequence, which is further overlain by the Neogene (Middle and Upper)
   Siwaliks and finally by Quaternary alluvium. Four geomorphological
   units, the Varanasi older alluvial plain, Aligarh older alluvial plain,
   terrace zones and the Ganga recent floodplain, abandoned channels,
   channel scars and meander scars represent various landforms. The
   hydrogeological cross-sections indicate the occurrence of a single
   aquifer down to 120 m. Some influent seepage from the River Ganga could
   be seen around Gangeswari, but the rest of the River Ganga is effluent.
   Groundwater-flow modelling was carried out to assess the degree of Ganga
   river and aquifer interaction. The River Ganga marks the western
   boundary; boundaries to the northeast and southeast are set as fixed
   heads to simulate lateral inflow into and outflow from the sub-basin
   respectively. The eastern boundary is simulated as a no-flow condition.
   The Mahawa and Badmar rivers are considered to be effluent. The area
   modelled is covered by a grid of 34 rows x 46 columns with three layers,
   viz., an unconfined aquifer, an aquitard which is underlain by a
   semi-confined to confined aquifer. The permeability distribution was
   inferred from morphometric analysis and pumping tests. Natural recharge
   due to monsoon rainfall forms the main input. The River Ganga stage data
   at Ahar, Naora and Ramghat has been used for assigning surface water
   levels and river bed elevations in the model. Abstraction from all
   existing deep and shallow tube wells has been assigned as output at
   various cells. A steady state flow simulation was carried out and
   calibrated against the June 1986 water level; subsequent transient
   conditions were calibrated up to May 1995. The computed groundwater
   balance was comparable to that estimated from field investigations. The
   aquifer modelling study has attempted to integrate all available
   information and provided a tool that could be used for predictive
   simulation. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The stream hydrograph is an integration of spatial and temporal
   variations in water input, storage and transfer processes within a
   catchment. For glacier basins in particular, inferences concerning
   catchment-scale processes have been developed from the varying form and
   magnitude of the diurnal hydrograph in the proglacial river. To date,
   however, such classifications of proglacial diurnal hydrographs have
   developed in a relatively subjective manner. This paper develops an
   objective approach to the classification of diurnal discharge hydrograph
   `shape' and `magnitude' using a combination of principal components
   analysis and cluster analysis applied to proglacial discharge
   time-series and to diurnal bulk flow indices. The procedure is applied
   to discharge time-series from two different glacier basins and four
   separate ablation seasons representing a gradient of increasing
   hydrological perturbation as a result of(i) variable water inputs
   generated by rainstorm activity and (ii) variable location and response
   of hydrological stores through a systematic decrease in catchment
   glacierized area. The potential of the technique for application in
   non-glacial hydrological contexts is discussed. Copyright (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{Eight radiation-based equations for determining evaporation were
   evaluated and expressed in five generalized forms. Five evaporation
   equations (Abtew, Hargreaves, Makkink, Priestley and Taylor and Turc),
   where each represents one generalized form, were then compared with pan
   evaporation measured at Changins station in Switzerland. The comparison
   was first made using the original constant values involved in each
   equation, and then using the recalibrated constant values. Evaluation of
   the Priestley and Taylor equation requires net radiation data as input,
   in this study, net radiation was estimated using Equation (16) owing to
   the lack of observation data. The results showed that when the original
   constant values were used, large errors resulted for most of the
   equations. When recalibrated constant values were substituted for the
   original constant values, four of the five equations improved greatly,
   and all five equations performed well for determining mean annual
   evaporation. For seasonal and monthly evaporation, the Hargreaves and
   Turc equations showed a significant bias, especially for cold months.
   With properly determined constant values, the Makkink and modified
   Priestley and Taylor equations resulted in monthly evaporation values
   that agreed most closely with pan evaporation in the study region. The
   simple Abtew equation can also be used when other meteorological data
   except radiation are not available. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) measures three-dimensional
   velocities in a small, remote sampling volume at high frequencies,
   however, these measurements incorporate errors that are intrinsic to the
   measurement technique. This paper demonstrates a new method for
   calculating the total measurement errors, including sampling errors,
   Doppler noise and errors due to velocity shear in the sampling volume
   associated with single-point ADV measurements. This procedure
   incorporates both the effects of instrument configuration and the
   distribution of errors between velocity components for any probe
   orientation. It is shown that the ADV can characterize turbulent
   velocity fluctuations at frequencies up to the maximum sampling rate and
   that Reynolds shear stress errors are very small. Copyright (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Digital elevation models (DEMs) are currently generated using satellite
   imagery, but little is known about how errors in satellite-derived DEMs
   affect hydrogeomorphological products such as relief, elevation
   contours, basin boundaries and stream networks. This study identified
   and minimized vertical errors for a SPOT-derived DEM of the 532 km(2)
   Little Washita River, OK, watershed and then assessed how elevation
   inaccuracies affected hydrogeomorphological analyses. SPOT-derived DEM
   errors were identified using a set of ground control points (GCPs) and
   by comparing the 600 000 pixels comprising the SPOT image of the study
   area to high and low accuracy US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
   airborne-derived DEMs. The comparative analysis identified a basin-wide
   error structure in the SPOT product that post-processing of the SPOT
   image then reduced from an RMSE of 8.7 to 4.5 m. Although SPOT- and
   USGS-derived topographic relief images had a poor correlation at small
   spatial scales, at larger hillslope scales nearly 90\% of the image
   pixels overlapped. For basin-scare descriptors, such as catchment area,
   stream length, stream density and Horton ratios, SPOT- and USGS-derived
   estimates differed by no more than 3\%. At smaller spatial scales,
   however, an overlay of SPOT-derived vector images of basin boundaries
   and stream networks with equivalent higher accuracy products revealed
   that the products were incongruent on average at 100 m and at most up to
   distances of 1 km. In summary, the accuracy of the SPOT-derived DEM was
   adequate for deriving estimates of basin average hydrogeomorphology but
   was unable to match equivalent products derived from USGS 7.5-minute
   DEMs at scales finer than 100 m. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{A mass balance budget of the suspended sediment in the St. Lawrence
   River was established for the sector stretching from Cornwall, Ontario,
   to Quebec City, Quebec, for the period 1989-1993. The approach consisted
   of analysing the amount of sediment contributed by the different
   tributaries, on a watershed-by-watershed basis, through `sediment
   concentration-discharge' models incorporating more than 4000 data points
   collected since 1983. Lake Ontario contributes less than 3\% of the
   particulate load at Quebec City, while St. Lawrence tributaries on the
   south and north shores contribute 19\% and 13\%, respectively, of the
   sediment load. Our findings indicate that nearly 65\% of the suspended
   sediments come from erosion of the bed and banks of the St. Lawrence
   River. This finding is broadly supported by numerous geomorphological
   and sedimentological observations and is consistent with the geological
   history of the river and the structures built on its banks in recent
   decades. Upstream-downstream mass balance studies conducted on
   individual river sectors indicate that the sources of erosion are
   located mainly in the Beauharnois Canal region, between Montreal and Les
   Greves, and further downstream, between the outlet of Lake Saint-Pierre
   and Portneuf. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The relatively high cost of commercially available raindrop
   spectrometers and disdrometers has inhibited detailed and intensive
   research on drop size distribution, kinetic energy and momentum of
   rainfall which are important for understanding and modelling soil
   erosion caused by raindrop detachment. In this study, an approach to
   find the drop size distribution, momentum and kinetic energy of rainfall
   using a relatively inexpensive device that uses a piezoelectric force
   transducer for sensing raindrop impact response is introduced. The
   instrument continuously and automatically records, on a time-scale, the
   amplitude of electrical pulses produced by the impact of raindrops on
   the surface of the transducer. The size distribution of the raindrops
   and their respective kinetic energy are calculated by analysing the
   number and amplitude of pulses recorded, and from the measured volume of
   total rainfall using a calibration curve. Simultaneous measurements of
   the instrument, a rain gauge and a dye-stain method were used to assess
   the performance of the instrument. Test results from natural and
   simulated rainfalls are presented. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The behaviour of river waves is described using a simplified
   dimensionless form of the momentum equation in conjunction with the
   continuity equation. Three dimensionless parameters were derived based
   on a quantitative linear analysis. These parameters, which depend on the
   Froude number of the steady uniform flow and the geometric
   characteristics of the river, permit quantification of the influence of
   inertia and pressure in the momentum equation. It was found that dynamic
   and diffusion waves occur mainly on gentle channel slopes and the
   transition between them is characterized by the Froude number. On the
   other hand, the kinematic wave has a wide range of applications. If the
   channel slope is greater than 1\%, the kinematic wave is particularly
   suitable for describing the hydraulics of flow. Since slopes in natural
   channel networks are often greater than 1\%, an analytical solution of
   the linearized kinematic wave equation with lateral inflow uniformly
   distributed along the channel is desirable and was therefore derived.
   The analytical solution was then implemented in a channel routing module
   of an existing simple rainfall-runoff model. The results obtained using
   the analytical solution compared well with those obtained from a
   non-linear kinematic wave model. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{This paper outlines the application of a new data-based mechanistic
   (DBM) modelling methodology to the characterization of the sediment
   transmission dynamics in a small upland reservoir, Wyresdale Park,
   Lancashire. The DBM modelling strategy exploits advanced statistical
   procedures to infer the dynamic model structure and its associated
   parameters directly from the instrumented data, producing a
   parametrically efficient, continuous time, transfer function model which
   relates suspended sediment load at the reservoir inflow to the outflow
   at the event scale. The associated differential equation model
   parameters have physical attributes which can be interpreted in terms of
   sediment transmission processes and associated reservoir trap
   efficiency. Sedigraph analysis suggests that wind-induced resuspension
   episodically supplies an additional load to the reservoir outlet. The
   stochastic nature of the DBM model makes it ideal for evaluating the
   effects of uncertainty through Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) for
   discharge and sediment transmission. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The exemplar-aided constructor of hyper-rectangles (EACH) model which

   strengthen its performance in variable stream flow extension. The
   modification is intended to resolve the contradiction between building
   hyper-rectangles and predictive accuracy in which the number of
   hyperrectangles becomes too large if higher accuracy is required. To
   explore the feasibility of the modified EACH, a mathematical function is
   simulated by the model. It is then applied to extend the 10-day stream
   flow records according to the nearby rainfall and/or stream flow gauges.
   The results show that the modified EACH achieves the goal of saving
   memory space and promoting predictive accuracy, and its performance is
   better than those of the original EACH and traditional methods. This

Title = {{Use of the recession characteristics of snowmelt hydrographs in the

Abstract = {{For a better management of water resources, the information on water
   stored in a basin in the form of snow is of immense use. Changes in the
   snow water storage with time influence the recession characteristics of
   the hydrographs. Recession is found to be slower in a basin when it
   contains higher snow water storage and becomes faster as the volume of
   stored water reduces. In other words, the recession coefficient is not
   constant throughout the melt season, it changes with time. In the
   present study, the possibility of assessing snow water storage at any
   time during the melt season using recession coefficients is examined.
   The hydrograph analyses have been made for the Glatzbach watershed in
   the Hohe Tauern region of the Austrian Alps. For this purpose, a
   relationship between snow water storage and the recession coefficients
   is developed. This study suggests a simple and useful approach to assess
   the snow water storage in a basin at any time during the snowmelt
   season. The information on the snow water storage of a basin can be
   obtained using a readily derived single parameter, the recession
   coefficient. The results are based on limited data, but they are
   sufficient to illustrate how the changes in snow water storage control
   the recession characteristics of the hydrographs. These investigations
   set the pace for further research in this area. Copyright (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{Root water uptake patterns are often studied with simulation models of
   the unsaturated soil water flow, as they are difficult to measure
   directly. Calibration of these models is not straightforward and causes
   uncertainties in simulated uptake distributions. In this paper we study
   how uncertainties in the calibration of the SWIF model affect
   uncertainty intervals in simulated uptake patterns of an Austrian pine
   stand (Pinus nigra var. nigra) on a sandy soil. After calibrating and
   validating SWIF with a large data set of more than 125 000 measured soil
   water contents over a three year period, uncertainty ranges in simulated
   soil water dynamics and root water uptake distributions were estimated
   with a Monte Carlo analysis.
   In general, uncertainties in root uptake patterns were small (typically
   <2 10(-4) m(3) m(-3) day(-1)) and were higher for trees with a shallow
   rooting system (0.8 m) than for trees with a deep rooting system (2.5
   m). Uncertainties arose mainly from uncertainties in simulated soil
   water fluxes and from variations in the reduction of uptake during
   periods of drought. Uncertainties in soil water contents were far higher
   (typically 0.01 m(3) m(-3)) than uncertainties in uptake, illustrating
   that uncertainties in uptake parameters and those in the distribution of
   water uptake hardly affect the modelling of soil water dynamics. Root
   water uptake models should therefore be validated against measured
   uptake distributions, which can be determined on sandy soils during dry
   periods with a high water use when soil fluxes are negligible to uptake.

Abstract = {{The primary objective of the study is to propose a strategy for
   rainfall-runoff model calibration at ungauged sites. This strategy
   comprises two main components: (1) development of the regional analysis

   utilization of the synthetic flow duration curves for model calibration.
   Since the regional analysis method can synthesize the flow duration
   curves at ungauged sites, the continuous rainfall-runoff model coupled
   with a global optimization method were applied in southern Taiwan using
   the synthetic flow duration curve as an objective for model calibration.
   The results reveal that the regional flow duration curve and the
   strategy for model calibration at ungauged sites have good performances

Abstract = {{Stemflow of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) represents a significant input of
   water and elements to the soil and might influence the spatial patterns
   and the rate of seepage fluxes at the stand scale. We investigated the
   soil solution chemistry at different depths and distances from the stem
   and the element fluxes with stemflow, throughfall and seepage in
   proximal and distal stem areas of a 130-year-old beech/oak forest in
   Steigerwald (northern Bavaria, Germany). The proximal stem area (in
   total 286 m(2) ha(-1)) was defined as a 1 m(2), 60 cm deep cylinder
   around the beech stem. Seepage fluxes were calculated by a soil
   hydrological model for 1996 using measured soil matrix potentials and
   tree xylem flow data for calibration. Stemflow represented 6.6\% of the
   annual soil water input. With the exception of H+ fluxes, less than 10\%
   of the total element fluxes with throughfall and stemflow reached the
   soil via stemflow. The volume-weighted concentrations of H+, K+ and
   SO42- in stemflow were higher than those in throughfall, while other
   elements had similar concentrations. Soil solution K+ concentrations
   decreased with stem distance, but the Na+, Mg2+, Cl- and SO42-
   concentrations increased. Gradients for other elements were not
   statistically significant. Stemflow had a strong influence on the
   spatial patterns of element fluxes with seepage. The water fluxes
   through the soil of the proximal stem areas at a depth of 60 cm
   contributed 13.5\% to the total seepage at the stand scale. Proximal to
   the stems about 20\% of total seepage for K+, Mn2+, Al2+, dissolved
   organic N and dissolved organic C were concentrated, but only 8-10\% for
   Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+. The loss of acid-neutralizing capacity calculated
   from the flux balance was about four times higher proximal to the stems
   compared with distal areas, indicating high rates of soil acidification
   proximal to the stems.
   Our results confirm the concept of a microsite around beech stems,
   characterized by high element and water fluxes in comparison with distal
   stem areas. Calculations of seepage fluxes and element budgets in beech
   stands have to consider the spatial heterogeneity of fluxes induced by
   stemflow. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The Dead Sea is the lowest spot on Earth. It is a closed saline lake
   located in the middle of the Jordan Rift Valley between Lake Tiberias
   and the Red Sea. Its major tributaries are the Jordan River itself and
   the Dead Sea side wadis. The Dead Sea has a unique ecosystem and its
   water has curative, industrial and recreational significance. The level
   of the Dead Sea has been continuously falling since the early 1930s at
   an average rate of 0.7 m per year. The water level, as of February 1998,
   is about 410.9 m below mean sea level. In this paper, a water balance
   model is developed for the Dead Sea by considering different
   hydrological components of this water balance, including precipitation,
   runoff, evaporation and groundwater flow. This model is calibrated based
   on historical levels of the Dead Sea. Different scenarios are
   investigated, including the proposed Dead Sea-Red Sea Canal. This
   project is supposed to halt the shrinking of the Dead Sea and restore it
   to pre-1950 levels in the next century. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{A tension infiltrometer technique was used to characterize differences
   in hydraulic conductivity (K) in two rain-fed hillsides (north-facing
   and south-facing) in central Chile. For the north-facing locations,
   smaller values of K (at a range of supply water pressure heads psi)
   compared with south-facing locations were found, with accentuated
   differences close to saturation (zero pressure head). The differences
   were attributed to differences in texture and organic matter contents
   observed for the two sites. Furthermore, K(psi) had a tendency to
   increase with increasing slope gradient. This tendency was to an extent
   explained by the deviation from requirements of measurements on level
   ground. The differences found in K(psi) between different slope
   gradients were explained by the differences in the vertical and lateral
   hydraulic conductivity and by the occurrence of surface sealing in low
   slope plots. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Hortonian runoff was measured from plots with lengths of 1.25 and 12 m,
   and at watershed level for rainstorms during the 1996 rainy season in
   cental Cote d'Ivoire, Africa. A clear reduction in runoff coefficients
   was found with increasing slope lengths, giving order of magnitude
   differences between runoff measurements at point level (1 m(2): 30-50\%
   of total rain) and watershed level (130 ha: 4\% of total rain). Runoff
   reduction from 1.25 and 12 m slopes was reproduced for each major
   runoff-producing rainstorm at two different sets of plots, but the
   reduction was erratic for rainfall events which produced little runoff.
   In addition, runoff reduction varied wildly from one rainstorm to the
   next. In the analysis, we show that the spatial variability of runoff
   parameters causes the erratic behaviour during rainstorms with little
   runoff. During the more important, larger runoff-producing events, which
   give 78\% of total runoff, the temporal dynamics of the rainfall-runoff
   process determine the reduction of runoff coefficients from longer
   slopes. A simple infiltration/runoff model was used to simulate the
   field results, thereby confirming the importance of rainfall dynamics as
   an explanatory factor for measured reduction of runoff coefficients.
