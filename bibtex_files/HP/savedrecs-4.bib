Abstract = {{Information on intensity-duration-frequency of rainfall is commonly
   required for a variety of hydrologic applications. In this study, trends
   are estimated for different durations of annual extreme rainfall using
   the regional average Mann-Kendall S trend test. The method of L-moments
   was employed to delineate homogeneous regions. The trend test was
   modified to account for observed autocorrelation, and a bootstrap
   methodology was used to account for the observed spatial correlation.
   Numerical analysis was performed on 44 rainfall stations from the
   province of Ontario, Canada, for a 20 year time frame. This was done
   using data from homogeneous regions established using the L-moments
   procedure for the annual maximum observations for the following
   durations: 5, 10, 15 and 30 min, and 1, 2, 6 and 12 h. Depending on
   different rainfall durations, four or five homogeneous regions were
   delineated.
   Based on a 5\% significance level, approximately 23\% of the regions
   tested had a significant trend, predominantly for short-duration storms.
   Serial dependency was observed in 2.3\% of data sets and spatial
   correlation was found in 18\% of the regions. The presence of serial and
   spatial correlation had a significant impact on trend determination.

Abstract = {{In recent years in North America, a number of government agencies and
   industries have begun to reinvest in meteorological networks. This
   investment must be based on sound scientific advice. Increased
   meteorological station network density can be beneficial for a number of
   purposes, including flood forecasting. This study aimed at investigating
   the impact of network density at two temporal scales, i.e. for the
   estimation of total annual precipitation and for the estimation of daily
   precipitation during specific rain events. This was done using kriging
   as a means to estimate the spatial distribution and variance of
   rainfall. Kriged precipitation from two network scenarios (sparse and
   dense) were used as input into the HSAMI hydrological model and
   simulations were compared on five drainage basins in the Mauricie area
   (Quebec, Canada).
   A comparison of the distribution of total annual precipitation
   interpolated from the two network scenarios showed that adding stations
   changed the distribution and magnitude of rainfall in the study area.
   High precipitation cells were better defined with the denser network,
   and decreases in the relative spatial variance were observed. Similarly,
   kriged daily precipitation provided a more defined spatial distribution
   of rainfall during important rain events of 1999, and variance was also
   reduced when the denser network was used.
   Finally, simulations performed with the HSAMI model were generally
   improved when the precipitation inputs were estimated using a denser
   station network for most drainage basins studied, as expressed by
   increased Nash coefficients and a decreased root-mean-square error. Peak
   flows during important summer flood events were generally better
   simulated when a denser network was used to calculate the mean daily
   precipitation used as input. Total cumulated volume estimations during
   the rain events were also generally improved with a denser network.
   This study showed that the estimation of variance remains an important
   tool for rain gauge network design. Moreover, network density was shown
   to have an important impact on the quality of flow simulations, even
   when a lumped model is used. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Fluxes of energy and water vapour were measured continuously over an
   similar to120-year-old black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.)
   forest in northern Saskatchewan, Canada, from 6 May 1999 to 5 May 2001
   using the eddy covariance technique as part of the Boreal Ecosystem
   Research and Monitoring Sites (BERMS) program. These results demonstrate
   that long-term eddy covariance fluxes can reliably be measured during
   the harsh boreal winter. Typical daytime bulk surface conductance values
   were about 5-8 mm s(-1) during the growing season. Surface conductance
   sharply declined after midday in response to increasing vapour pressure
   deficit. The monthly mean values of energy balance components showed
   that, in spring (March-June), partitioning of available energy flux was
   mainly in the form of sensible heat, which changed to almost equal
   proportions of sensible and latent heat in the summer (July-October). In
   winter (November-February), most of the net radiation was balanced by
   sensible heat flux. The monthly mean values of net radiation, sensible
   heat and latent heat flux were about -20 to 20 W m(-2), -10 to 25 W
   m(-2) and 5 to 10 W m(-2) respectively in winter. The average mid-day
   Bowen ratios were approximately 3.5, 1.7 and 5.2 in the spring. summer
   and winter seasons respectively. The maximum daily evaporation was about
   3.5 mm day(-1) in summer and 0.1-0-25 mm day(-1) in winter. Over the 2
   year period, the accumulated precipitation was 835 mm; this compared
   with 711 70 mm of evapotranspiration, which showed that more than 85\%
   of water was returned to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration. This
   study reports the first complete annual cycles of energy and water
   vapour fluxes at this black spruce site. Since black spruce is the
   dominant tree species in the North American boreal forest, these results
   have significance for regional and global energy and water cycles.

Abstract = {{Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) is increasingly used for field soil
   water estimation because the measurement is non-destructive and less
   affected by soil texture, bulk density and temperature. However, with
   the increase in instrument resolution, the influences of soil bulk
   density and temperature on TDR soil moisture measurements have been
   reported. The influence is primarily caused by changes in soil and water
   dielectric permittivity when soil compaction and temperature varies. The
   objective of this study is to quantify the influence of soil bulk
   density and temperature, and to provide the corresponding correction
   methods. Data collected from sand, sandy loam, loam and clay loam show a
   linear relationship between the square root of dielectric constant of
   dry soil and bulk density, and a bulk density correction formula has
   been developed. The dielectric permittivity of soil solids estimated
   using this formula is close to that of oxides of aluminium, silicon,
   magnesium and calcium. Data collection from sandy loam show a noticeable
   decrease in measured soil moisture with increase in temperature when the
   volumetric soil water content is above 0-30 m(3) m(-3). A
   temperature-correction equation has been developed, which could provide
   the corrected soil moisture based on soil temperature and TDR-measured
   moisture. The effect of clay content has been detected, but it is not
   statistically significant. High clay contents cause the underestimation
   of soil water content in the low moisture range and overestimation of
   soil water content in the high moisture range. Copyright (C) 2003 John

Abstract = {{The spatial variability of soil water content can be measured with the
   ground wave velocity of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) using short
   antenna offsets, but picking the correct ground wave arrival time is
   rather difficult. In applying the GPR ground wave method to soil water
   content estimation it is also important to know the effective sampling
   depth of the method. Uniform drainage experiments were conducted with
   100 and 450 MHz GPR antennas using 1.0 and 2.0 in fixed antenna
   separations on a sandy loam soil to investigate time zero picking
   methodologies and to estimate the sampling depth of the GPR method. The
   GPR water content data were compared with time-domain reflectometry
   (TDR)-measured data using six vertical TDR probes of different lengths.
   Time zero was calculated from an air calibration at a 2-0 m antenna
   separation and from wide-angle reflection and refraction data, and a
   difference was found between the two time-zero calibration methods. A
   method was analysed to determine the arrival time of the leading edge of
   the direct ground wavelet using the arrival time of the peak amplitude,
   since the arrival time of the leading edge of the ground wave can be
   difficult to pick. Regression analysis showed that the GPR (100 MHz)
   measured water content was not different from the water content measured
   with TDR at 0-0.1 in depth, implying that this may be a reasonable
   estimate of the GPR ground wave method's sampling depth. A similar
   analysis based on the differences between the 0-0.2 m TDR and the GPR
   shows that the effective sampling depth of the direct ground wave of the
   450 MHz data is less than the sampling depth of the 100 MHz data.

Abstract = {{This study examines the relationship between wetlands hidden beneath the
   forest canopy ('cryptic wetlands') and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   export to streams and lakes in forested ecosystems. In the Turkey Lakes
   Watershed (TLW), located in the Algoma Highlands of central Ontario,
   Canada, there is substantial natural variation in average annual DOC
   export (kgC ha(-1) year(-1)),ranging from 11.4 to 31.5 kgC ha(-1)
   year(-1) in catchments with no apparent wetlands. We hypothesized that
   the natural variation in DOC export was related to cryptic wetlands.
   Cryptic wetlands were derived manually from geographic coordinates that
   were surveyed with a differential global positioning system, and
   automatically from identification of topographic depressions and flat
   slopes (<1.5degrees) within a digital elevation model (DEM) in a
   geographic information system. For the TLW catchments, which are
   characterized by shallow soils over bedrock, a significant correlation
   (r(2) greater than or equal to 0-9, p < 0.001) between manual and
   automated methods was observed for scales up to 50 in when a light
   detection and ranging DEM was used for the topographic analysis.
   Regression models indicated that cryptic wetlands (\%) explained the
   majority of the natural variation in DOC export (kgC ha(-1) year(-1)),
   with r(2) = 0.88 (p < 0.001) for the model based on the manually derived
   wetlands and r(2) = 0.85 (p < 0.001) for the model based on the
   automatically derived wetlands. The strength and significance of the
   automatically derived wetlands (\%) versus DOC export (kgC ha(-1)
   year(-1)) regression model diminished when other sources of DEMs were
   used. This study emphasizes the importance of including cryptic wetlands
   in predictive models of DOC export, particularly in catchments where the
   topography includes depressions and flat areas but no apparent wetlands.

Abstract = {{In-stream experiments involving additions of phosphate were conducted to
   determine the soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) retention potential of a
   perennial first-order stream that drains a 2.7 km(2) agricultural
   catchment in southern Ontario. SRP retention was determined in relation
   to highly elevated SRP concentrations under low flow conditions. Point
   source treatments of phosphate were added to three reaches of this
   stream during two time periods when baseline SRP concentrations were
   notably different (early summer and early autumn). The reaches selected
   varied with respect to streambed shape and gradient, direction of
   groundwater flow, and channel vegetation type and density. One of the
   three experimental stream reaches was dredged between the two sampling
   periods, so that all vegetation and the top 25 cm of sediments were
   removed.
   SRP retention in the stream ranged from 0.8 to 24.1 mug m(-2) s(-1).
   Dredging the stream sediments did not alter the ability of the stream to
   remove SRP from the water column. SRP retention over the experimental
   reaches was generally 5-10\% of the elevated concentration (0.7-4.2 mg
   l(-1), a factor of 8-53 above pre-experiment conditions), although
   low-flow conditions in the stream were conducive to retention by stream
   sediments. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrological response of low relief, wetland-dominated zones of
   discontinuous permafrost is poorly understood. This poses a major
   obstacle to the development of a physically meaningful meso-scale
   hydrological model for the Mackenzie basin, one of the world's largest
   northern basins. The present study examines the runoff response of five
   representative study basins (Scotty Creek, and the Jean-Marie, Birch,
   Blackstone and Martin Rivers) in the lower Liard River valley as a
   function of their major biophysical characteristics. High-resolution (4
   m x 4 m) IKONOS satellite imagery was used in combination with aerial
   and ground verification surveys to classify the land cover, and to
   delineate the wetland area connected to the drainage system. Analysis of
   the annual hydrographs of each basin for the 4 year period 1997 to 2000,
   demonstrated that runoff was positively correlated with the drainage
   density, basin slope, and the percentage of the basin covered by channel
   fens, and was negatively correlated with the percentage of the basin
   covered by flat bogs. The detailed analysis of the water-level response
   to summer rainstorms at several nodes along the main drainage network in
   the Scotty Creek basin showed that the storm water was slowly routed
   through channel fens with an average flood-wave velocity of 0.23 km
   h(-1). The flood-wave velocity appears to be controlled by channel slope
   and hydraulic roughness in a manner consistent with the Manning formula,
   suggesting that a roughness-based routing algorithm might be useful in
   large-scale hydrological models. Copyright (C) 2003 Crown in the right

Abstract = {{Ice jamming during the spring breakup of the ice cover in the lower
   reaches of the Peace River has been identified as the main agent of
   flooding and replenishment of the Peace-Athabasca delta (PAD)
   ecosystems. The relative rarity of major ice jams in the lower Peace
   River following construction of the Bennett Dam has resulted in serious
   habitat degradation and risk to local ecology, and concern has been
   raised over potential climate change impacts. This issue is under active
   study that encompasses use of various types of model, field data
   collection, and analysis of archived records. An important component of
   the study aims at determination of threshold flows that can result in
   significant flooding when a jam is in place in the PAD reach of the
   Peace. This question is investigated by means of RIVJAM, a numerical
   model that computes the water surface and thickness profiles of a jam in
   a given river reach. First, the model is calibrated using field data
   obtained during the 1996 and 1997 ice-jam floods. Calibration
   coefficients are shown to be the same for both events and consistent
   with default values determined from previous applications in other
   rivers. A by-product of the calibration process is the quantification of
   the flow reversals occurring under high-stage conditions in the three
   major tributaries of the lower Peace. Next, the model is applied with
   increasing flow values and the resulting water surface profiles are
   compared with bank elevations. These comparisons indicate that an
   incoming flow of at least 4000 m(3) s(-1) is required to produce
   significant flooding of the delta. The calibrated model can also be used
   to examine the efficacy of controlled water releases at the Bennett Dam
   as a means of enhancing flooding potential. Copyright (C) 2003 Crown in

Abstract = {{Climate change is projected to significantly affect future hydrologic
   processes over many regions of the world. This is of particular
   importance for alpine systems that provide critical water supplies to
   lower-elevation regions. The western cordillera of Canada is a prime
   example where changes to temperature and precipitation could have
   profound hydro-climatic impacts not only for the cordillera itself, but
   also for downstream river systems and the drought-prone Canadian
   Prairies. At present, impact researchers primarily rely on global
   climate models (GCMs) for future climate projections. The main objective
   of this study is to assess several GCMs in their ability to simulate the
   magnitude and spatial variability of current (1961-90) temperature and
   precipitation over the western cordillera of Canada. In addition,
   several gridded data sets of observed climate for the study region are
   evaluated. Results reveal a close correspondence among the four gridded
   data sets of observed climate, particularly for temperature. There is,
   however, considerable variability regarding the various GCM simulations
   of this observed climate. The British, Canadian, German, Australian, and
   US GFDL models are superior at simulating the magnitude and spatial
   variability of mean temperature. The Japanese GCM is of intermediate
   ability, and the US NCAR model is least representative of temperature in
   this region. Nearly all the models substantially overestimate the
   magnitude of total precipitation, both annually and on a seasonal basis.
   An exception involves the British (Hadley) model, which best represents
   the observed magnitude and spatial variability of precipitation. This
   study improves our understanding regarding the accuracy of GCM climate
   simulations over the western cordillera of Canada. The findings may
   assist in producing more reliable future scenarios of hydro-climatic
   conditions over various regions of the country. Copyright (C) 2003 Crown

Abstract = {{Most often, flood frequency analysis describes a flood event only by its
   peak. However, the true flood severity is also defined by its volume and
   duration. This paper presents an approach allowing flood events to be
   considered in a more complete way: the flood-duration-frequency (QdF)
   approach. In a similar manner to the rainfall
   intensity-duration-frequency analysis, averaged discharges are computed
   over different fixed durations d. For each duration a frequency
   distribution of maximum averaged discharges is studied. Finally, a
   continuous formulation is fitted, as a function of the return period T
   and the duration d over which discharges have been averaged. The
   proposed model has been tested for 169 catchments in the provinces of
   Quebec and Ontario, Canada. The shapes of the QdF curves enabled us to
   define different types of flood behaviour and to identify the
   corresponding geographic regions. This mapping of flood behaviour was
   the basis for the delineation of seven homogeneous geographical regions,
   containing catchments having the same hydrological behaviour as is
   required for regional flood frequency analysis. Copyright (C) 2003 John

Abstract = {{The majority of hydrologic engineering applications deal with ungauged
   watersheds. Various empirical methods are available for synthesizing
   unit hydrographs for ungauged watersheds from information obtained from
   maps or field inspection of the watershed. An alternative to the
   employment of generalized synthetic unit hydrographs is to develop a
   regional dimensionless hydrograph to characterize the local
   rainfall-runoff processes better. The derivation of such a dimensionless
   hydrograph is described for Alberta foothills, based on the analysis of
   31 basins and 61 rainfall-runoff events. The analysis shows that it is
   possible to derive a representative dimensionless hydrograph for the
   region with reasonable accuracy by averaging the observed direct runoff
   hydrographs converted into a dimensionless form. However, considerable
   uncertainty is associated with the estimation of the excess rainfall
   duration and the lag time of the events analysed. The lag time is the
   key parameter needed to convert the regional dimensionless hydrograph
   into an ungauged watershed unit hydrograph. Possible reasons for
   unexplained lag time variations are discussed. The regional
   dimensionless hydrograph developed and lag time curve were used to
   regenerate the original 61 hydrographs. Results were compared with the
   generalized Soil Conservation Service dimensionless unit hydrograph
   which tended to produce larger errors in predicted peak flows. Error
   analysis indicates the limits of accuracy that may be expected from the
   method. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Each spring in Alberta, Canada, the potential snowmelt runoff is
   forecast for several basins to assess the water supply situation. Water
   managers need this forecast to plan water allocations for the following
   summer season. The Lodge Creek and Middle Creek basins, located in
   southeastern Alberta, are two basins that require this type of late
   winter forecast of potential spring runoff. Historically, the forecast
   has been based upon a combination of regression equations. These results
   are then interpreted by a forecaster and are modified based on the
   forecaster's heuristic knowledge of the basin. Unfortunately, this
   approach has had limited success in the past, in terms of the accuracy
   of these forecasts, and consequently an alternative methodology is
   needed.
   In this study, the applicability of fuzzy logic modelling techniques for
   forecasting water supply was investigated. Fuzzy logic has been applied
   successfully in several fields where the relationship between cause and
   effect (variable and results) are vague. Fuzzy variables were used to
   organize knowledge that is expressed `linguistically' into a formal
   analysis. For example, `high snowpack', `average snowpack' and `low
   snowpack' became variables. By applying fuzzy logic, a water supply
   forecast was created that classified potential runoff into three
   forecast zones: `low', `average' and `high'. Spring runoff forecasts
   from the fuzzy expert systems were found to be considerably more
   reliable than the regression models in forecasting the appropriate
   runoff zone, especially in terms of identifying low or average runoff
   years. Based on the modelling results in these two basins, it is
   concluded that fuzzy logic has a promising potential for providing
   reliable water supply forecasts. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{Digital elevation models (DEMs) are useful and popular tools from which
   topographic parameters can be quickly and efficiently extracted for
   various hydrologic applications. DEMs coupled with automated methods for
   extracting topographic information provide a powerful means of
   parameterizing hydrologic models over a wide range of scales. However,
   choosing appropriate DEM scales for particular hydrologic modelling
   applications is limited by a lack of understanding of the effects of
   scale and grid resolution on land-surface representation. The scale
   effects of aggregation on square-grid DEMs of two continental-scale
   basins are examined. Base DEMs of the Mackenzie and Missouri River
   basins are extracted from the HYDRO1k DEM of North America. Successively
   coarser grids of 2, 4, 8,... 64 km were generated from the `base' DEMs
   using simple linear averaging. TOPAZ (Topographic Parameterization) was
   applied to the base and aggregated DEMs using constant critical source
   area and minimum source channel length values to extract topographic
   variables at varying scales or resolutions. The effects of changing DEM
   resolution are examined by considering changes in the spatial
   distribution and statistical properties of selected topographic
   variables of hydrological importance. The effects of increasing grid
   size on basin and drainage network delineation, and derived topographic
   variables, tends to be non-linear. In particular, changes in overall
   basin extent and drainage network configuration make it impractical to
   apply a simple scaling function to estimate variable values for
   fine-resolution DEMs from those derived from coarse-resolution DEMs.
   Results also suggest the resolution to which a DEM can be reduced by
   aggregation and still provide useful topographic information for
   continental-scale hydrologic modelling is that at which the mean
   hydraulic slope falls to approximately 1\%. In this study, that
   generally occurred at a resolution of about 10 km. Copyright (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Meteorological predictions, such as precipitation and temperature, are
   commonly used to improve real-time hydrologic forecasting, despite their
   inherent uncertainty and their absence in the model calibration stage.
   In this study, we quantify the effect of meteorological prediction
   errors on the accuracy of daily spring reservoir inflow forecasts using
   weather predictions in both the model calibration and testing phases.
   Different modelling experiments are compared using an operational
   conceptual model and nonlinear empirical models to assess the effects of
   using daily numerical weather predictions as opposed to the use of
   historical observations. It is found that, even with large prediction
   errors, meteorological forecasts can provide significant improvement of
   spring flow forecast for up to 7 days lead time, particularly for low
   flows. Spring flow prediction errors associated with the type of
   hydrological model used are significantly larger than those related to
   the meteorological predictions, particularly for 1 to 4 days ahead
   forecasts. The experimental results also indicate that multiple
   model-based forecasting using an iterative prediction approach appears
   to be the most effective method for an adequate use of weather
   predictions. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Pages = {{3387-3409}},

Abstract = {{In the absence of actual suspended sediment concentration (SSC)
   measurements, hydrologists have used sediment rating (sediment
   transport) curves to estimate (predict) SSCs for subsequent flux
   calculations. Various evaluations of the sediment rating-curve method
   were made using data from long-term, daily sediment-measuring sites
   within large ( > 1000 000 km(2)), medium ( < 1000 000 to > 1000 km(2)),
   and small ( < 1000 km(2)) river basins in the USA and Europe relative to
   the estimation of suspended sediment fluxes. The evaluations address
   such issues as the accuracy of flux estimations for various levels of
   temporal resolution as well as the impact of sampling frequency on the
   magnitude of flux estimation errors.
   The sediment rating-curve method tends to underpredict high, and
   overpredict low SSCs. As such, the range of errors associated with
   concomitant flux estimates for relatively short time-frames (e.g. daily,
   weekly) are likely to be substantially larger than those associated with
   longer time-frames (e.g. quarterly, annually) because the over- and
   underpredictions do not have sufficient time to balance each other.
   Hence, when error limits must be kept under +/-20\%, temporal resolution
   probably should be limited to quarterly or greater.
   The evaluations indicate that over periods of 20 or more years, errors
   of < 1\% can be achieved using a single sediment rating curve based on
   data spanning the entire period. However, somewhat better estimates for
   the entire period, and markedly better annual estimates within the
   period, can be obtained if individual annual sediment rating curves are
   used instead. Relatively accurate (errors < +/-20\%) annual suspended
   sediment fluxes can be obtained from hydrologically based monthly
   measurements/samples. For 5-year periods or longer, similar results can
   be obtained from measurements/samples collected once every 2 months. In
   either case, hydrologically based sampling, as opposed to calendar-based
   sampling is likely to limit the magnitude of flux estimation errors.

Abstract = {{At-a-station diurnal variations in carbonate hydrochemistry were
   measured during four observation periods at Davys Creek, a
   tufa-depositing stream in central NSW, Australia. Major ion
   concentrations and continuously logged measurements of specific
   conductivity, PH and temperature showed that changes in the amount of
   CaCO3 deposited upstream of the study reach were directly related to
   changes in diurnal water temperatures, which control the rate of CO2
   efflux to the atmosphere. The greatest upstream losses occurred during
   the mid-afternoon water temperature peak, whereas the lowest upstream
   losses occurred at sunrise, when water temperatures were at their
   lowest. Cloudy days at all times of the year produced small diurnal
   water temperatures ranges (c. 2-5degreesC) and, consequently, relatively
   small changes in upstream CaCO3 loss (23-50 mg L-1) through the day.
   Clear sunny days, especially during summer months, produced large
   diurnal water temperature changes (up to c. 11degreesC), which in turn
   triggered diurnal changes in upstream CaCO3 loss of up to 100 mg L-1. By
   implication, the active reach of tufa deposition must advance downstream
   and increase in length during the evening and vice versa during the day.
   Given that the temperature of Davys Creek waters are a function of
   insolation, changes in the reach of tufa deposition under baseflow
   conditions are a direct function of the prevailing weather. This has
   implications for the palaeoclimatic interpretation of fossil tufa
   deposits. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Bank erosion was measured at 91 stream banks located in 15 Danish rural
   1st and 2nd order streams over a 2-year period. Our aims were firstly to
   examine factors controlling spatial variation in bank erosion, secondly
   to estimate sediment and phosphorus (P) loss via bank erosion. The
   overall mean bank erosion rate was 11 mm year(-1). Bank erosion rate
   over the 2-year period was significantly related to a number of
   site-specific characteristics, including bank angle, bank vegetation
   cover, overhanging bank and estimated stream power. An empirical model
   for bank erosion based on these descriptive variables yielded a 55\%
   explanation of the observed spatial variation in bank erosion rate. Bank
   erosion was higher at the lower 50-cm bank section (20 mm year(-1)) than
   at the upper bank (6 mm year(-1)). Cattle fencing in grazed areas and
   buffer zones with riparian woodland lowered bank erosion rates. We found
   that total P content of bank material was high (0.64 g P kg(-1)) and at
   the same level as found in agricultural topsoil along the streams. The
   overall annual catchment loss of bank-derived clay-silt sediment and
   total P to streams amounted to 58-72 kg sediment ha(-1) and 0.23-0.28 kg
   P ha(-1), respectively. In comparison, the mean annual suspended
   sediment (SS) and total P losses from 14 similar sized Danish
   agricultural catchments were 122 kg SS ha(-1) and 0.58 kg P ha(-1) over
   the 2-year study period. Thus, bank erosion seems to be a major
   contributor of suspended sediment and P in this type of small
   channelized lowland stream. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional thermodynamic model for simulating lake-ice phenology
   is presented and evaluated. The model can be driven with observed daily
   or hourly atmospheric forcing of air temperature, relative humidity,
   wind speed, cloud amount and snowfall. In addition to computing the
   energy balance components, key model output includes the temperature
   profile at an arbitrary number of levels within the ice/snow (or the
   water temperature if there is no ice) and ice thickness (clear ice and
   snow-ice) on a daily basis, as well as freeze-up and break-up dates. The
   lake-ice model is used to simulate ice-growth processes on shallow lakes
   in arctic, sub-arctic, and high-boreal forest environments. Model output
   is compared with field and remote sensing observations gathered over
   several ice seasons. Simulated ice thickness, including snow-ice
   formation, compares favourably with field measurements. Ice-on and
   ice-off dates are also well simulated when compared with field and
   satellite observations, with a mean absolute difference of 2 days. Model
   simulations and observations illustrate the key role that snow cover
   plays on the seasonal evolution of ice thickness and the timing of
   spring break-up. It is also shown that lake morphometry, depth in
   particular, is a determinant of ice-off dates for shallow lakes at high
   latitudes. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Natural and agricultural wetlands are considered to be the major sources
   of global atmospheric methane (CH4). A one-dimensional model was
   developed to simulate methane emission and used to examine the influence
   of various physical processes on the rate of methane emission. Three
   processes involved in the methane emission are implemented in the model:
   production, reoxidation and transport. Three transport pathways were
   considered: diffusion across water-air or soil-air interfaces,
   ebullition and diffusion through plants. These pathways are influenced
   by soil properties, plant growth, water-table conditions, temperature
   and external inputs (e.g. fertilizer). The model was used to examine the
   seasonal variation of the methane emission at a rice field in Hunan,
   China, which was observed during a field experiment for consecutive
   (early and late) rice seasons in 1992. The observed seasonal variations
   of methane emission, and role of plants in transporting methane to the
   atmosphere, are captured by the model simulation. Further model
   applications were conducted to simulate effects of fertilizer and
   water-level condition on the methane emission. The results indicate that
   unfermented organic fertilizer produces a higher methane emission rate
   than mineral fertilizer. The simulations with treatments of a deep-water
   covering and constant moisture reduced the methane emission. The rice
   field study provides a framework for further development of the model
   towards simulations based on spatially distributed variables (e.g. water
   table, soil temperature and vegetation) at a regional scale. Copyright

Abstract = {{The magnitude and spatial distribution of snow on sea ice are both
   integral components of the ocean-sea-ice-atmosphere system. Although
   there exists a number of algorithms to estimate the snow water
   equivalent (SWE) on terrestrial surfaces, to date there is no precise
   method to estimate SWE on sea ice. Physical snow properties and in situ
   microwave radiometry at 19, 37 and 85 GHz, V and H polarization were
   collected for a 10-day period over 20 first-year sea ice sites.
   We present and compare the in situ physical, electrical and microwave
   emission properties of snow over smooth Arctic first-year sea ice for 19
   of the 20 sites sampled. Physical processes creating the observed
   vertical patterns in the physical and electrical properties are
   discussed. An algorithm is then developed from the relationship between
   the SWE and the brightness temperature measured at 37 GHz (55degrees) H
   polarization and the air temperature. The multiple regression between
   these variables is able to account for over 90\% of the variability in
   the measured SWE. This algorithm is validated with a small in situ data
   set collected during the 1999 field experiment. We then compare our data
   against the NASA snow thickness algorithm, designed as part of the NASA
   Earth Enterprise Program. The results indicated a lack of agreement
   between the NASA algorithm and the algorithm developed here. This lack
   of agreement is attributed to differences in scale between the Special
   Sensor Microwave/Imager and surface radiometers and to differences in
   the Antarctic versus Arctic snow physical and electrical properties.

Abstract = {{A LUCIFS model variant is presented that represents the influence of
   climate and land use change on fluvial systems. The study considers
   trends of climatic characteristics (air temperature, annual
   precipitation totals, rainfall erosion index, aridity and continentality
   coefficients) for the steppe and partially wooded steppe watersheds of
   the south of East Siberia (the Yenisey River macro-watershed). It also
   describes the influence of these characteristics on erosion processes,
   one indicator of which is the suspended sediment yield. Changes in the
   river network structure (the order of rivers, lengths, etc.) as a result
   of agricultural activity during the 20th century are investigated by
   means of analysis of maps of different dates for one of the watersheds,
   that of the Selenga River, the biggest tributary of Lake Baikal. The
   study reveals an increase of erosion process intensity in the first
   two-thirds of the century in the Selenga River watershed and a reduction
   of this intensity in the last third of the century, both in the Selenga
   River watershed and in most of the other watersheds of the study area.

Abstract = {{Only a few studies have attempted to link climate variability to
   glaciofluvial sediment transport, and none has incorporated atmospheric
   circulation changes quantitatively. This is the first attempt to do
   this. Using a statistical approach for three Icelandic basins, we
   establish some hypothesized interactions forming a chain of causality
   running from recent atmospheric circulation changes in the North
   Atlantic, through regional climate implications in southern Iceland,
   likely glaciological, nival and geomorphological impacts, hydrological
   responses, and finally to influences on suspended sediment fluxes.
   Furthermore, to provide some form of experimental control, the three
   glacierized basins chosen (the Jokulsa a Solheimasandi, the Holmsa and
   the Skoga in southern Iceland) exhibit minimal anthropogenic disturbance
   and negligible land-use change over the study period (1973-92). This
   helps to avoid the problem of disentangling the effects on sediment
   loads of concurrent land-use change and climate change, which often
   affect this type of study. We develop the study beyond the annual and
   seasonal patterns and focus on subseasonal (monthly) and daily event
   time scales, for which useful instrumental records are available.
   Suspended sediment loads in the Jokulsa a Solheimasandi and Holmsa
   basins are high, but have declined significantly at a semi-logarithmic
   rate over the 1973-92 period, typically from 14.6 to 7.6 kg s(-1) and
   from 40 to 10 kg s(-1) respectively. Decreases are most notable in
   spring and autumn. Declines are related to significant river flow
   reductions driven by significant cooling in spring and decreases in
   heavy daily precipitation events in autumn, which are only modestly
   offset by increases in flow and suspended sediment transport in summer
   and January. The annual melt-season thus appears to be starting later
   and becoming more compressed. In particular, spring cooling through the
   1973-92 period (e.g. April air temperatures decline at 0.99degreesC
   decade(-1)) is linked to a switch to a positive North Atlantic
   oscillation (NAO) index since the early 1970s and a slight tendency for
   a weakening of the southwesterly circulation over Iceland. This is
   likely to subdue rates of ablation, glacial drainage network expansion
   and debris melt-out in spring. Summer warming is significant (e.g. June
   air temperatures rise by 0.45degreesC decade(-1)), as is the tendency
   for January to become warmer and wetter, with higher discharges.
   Suspended sediment loads and discharge seem to be sensitive to subtle
   shifts in climatic seasonality influenced by circulation changes.
   However, it is shown that flow and sediment transport responses to
   climatic variability and change are highly complex and demand at least a
   subseasonal analysis. The results, therefore, provide useful insights
   into the workings of glaciofluvial sediment transport environments in
   the presence of climate and circulation variability but in the absence
   of land-use change. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to estimate the potential effects of
   changes in climate and land use on the mobilization of fine sediment and
   the net transport of wash load from the upstream basin to the lower
   Rhine delta. For this purpose, a suite of geographical information
   system-embedded models was developed that simulates the production, and
   transport of wash load through the drainage network and deposition on
   floodplains along the lower river reaches. The model results indicate
   that if climate changes in accordance with the UKHI climate-change
   scenario, in combination with land use changes, erosion rates will
   increase in the Alps and decrease in the German part of the basin.
   Averaged over the entire basin, erosion will increase by about 12\%.
   However, due to inefficient sediment delivery, increasing erosion in the
   Alps will have little effect on the sediment load further downstream. In
   the delta area, sediment loads are expected to decrease by 13\%. When
   changes in river discharge are accounted for, it appears that, although
   very high discharges are expected to occur more frequently,
   sedimentation on floodplains tends to decrease. This is caused mainly by
   reduced sediment loads at discharges during which the floodplains are
   just inundated and trapping efficiencies are high. Copyright (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Sediment cores (collected from nine headwater lakes and reservoirs in
   their catchments and adjacent areas and from ten floodplain sites in the
   middle and lower reaches of the two river systems) have been used to
   reconstruct changes in suspended sediment yields, rates of sedimentation
   and suspended sediment sources for the Ouse and Tweed catchments in the
   UK over the last ca 100-150 years in response to recent environmental
   change. For the small lake/reservoir catchments in or adjacent to the
   Ouse basin, average sediment yields for the recent period (1963-95) were
   generally found to exceed those for the period prior to 1963, by up to
   94\%, suggesting that sediment yields have increased over time. For the
   equivalent lake/reservoir catchments in and adjacent to the Tweed basin,
   sediment yields were generally lower in the period since 1963. In both
   basins, sediment yields over the past 100-150 years were characterized
   by considerable temporal variability, which was seen to reflect, at
   least in part, the significant changes in land use and land management
   that occurred within their catchments. No clear links between the
   variability of sediment yields and changes in climate were apparent.
   Changes in sediment source reconstructed for one of the lakes appeared
   primarily to reflect catchment disturbance during afforestation in the
   1940s. Average rates of overbank sedimentation for the ten floodplain
   sites varied considerably between sites. For those cores collected from
   the Ouse basin there was no consistent temporal trend, and average
   sedimentation rates for the period extending from ca 1895 to 1963 were
   broadly similar to those for the period since 1963. For the Tweed basin,
   sedimentation rates for all three cores were higher prior to 1963,
   reflecting the increased soil erosion and sediment yields associated
   with the conversion of pasture to arable land in the immediate
   post-World War II period and the ditching and planting operations
   associated with afforestation in the 1940s. Substantial downcore
   variability in the source of the overbank sediment, considered in terms
   of both source type and spatial location, was found in both river
   basins. This was seen to reflect land-use change, including land
   drainage, the conversion of pasture to arable land, afforestation, and
   increased cereal production. The evidence provided by the floodplain
   cores again showed little indication of any influence linked to climate
   change.
   Although the detailed patterns of temporal variation of sediment yield,
   overbank sedimentation rate and sediment source reconstructed from the
   sediment cores collected from the lake/reservoirs and floodplain
   locations are site specific, there is a general consistency between the
   changes in sediment dynamics reconstructed for the headwater catchments
   (based on the cores collected from the lakes and reservoirs) and the
   equivalent evidence for the middle and lowland reaches of the catchments
   (provided by overbank floodplain deposits). Despite significant changes
   in climate, and, more particularly, land use over this time period, the
   general lack of evidence of substantial changes in downstream sediment
   yield and rates of overbank sedimentation over the last ca 100-150 years
   in the Ouse and Tweed basins suggests that their sediment dynamics have
   been generally insensitive to recent environmental change. This finding
   has important implications when considering the likely response of
   these, and similar, UK river basins to future environmental change.

Abstract = {{Using evidence from aerial photographs, supported by field checks,
   changes in the fluvial systems of three catchments in the Kondoa Irangi
   Hills, Kondoa District, central Tanzania were mapped. This area is known
   for its severely eroded landscape and, today, also for the drastic
   measures introduced to deal with the soil erosion problem. In the early
   stages these included mechanical construction of contour bunds, but
   later emphasis was placed on tree planting and planting of elephant
   grass on sand fans and dry, sandy riverbeds. Restrictions were
   introduced on clearing land for cultivation and on felling of trees for
   construction material and fuel wood. The most dramatic conservation
   measure was the eviction, in 1979, of all livestock from 19 villages to
   halt the severe overgrazing.
   Since the different conservation measures have now been in effect for
   more than 20 years, their impact can be assessed. The sand rivers,
   conspicuous features of the study area, have in many places decreased in
   width. Their total surface area in the three catchments decreased by
   about two-thirds between 1960 and 1987. Previously unvegetated sand fans
   have been converted to crop production. Natural vegetation is now
   establishing itself on formerly barren areas. However, the badlands,
   which cover some 25\% of the study area and which take a very long time
   to recover, still seem to be relatively unaffected by the conservation
   efforts, although they decreased in extent by about 10\% between 1960
   and 1987. In the present report, the biophysical landscape changes and
   their implications for the drainage system in parts of the Kondoa Irangi
   Hills are discussed. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A wide range of environmental records is integrated in order to
   reconstruct the mechanisms of flooding and sediment transport within the
   170 km(2) Petit Lac catchment, Annecy, France, over time scales of
   10(-1) to 10(2) years. These records include sequential lake sediment
   trap samples and cores, floodplain stratigraphies, dated landform
   assemblages, hydro-meteorological records, and documented histories of
   river channel and land-use change. Mineral magnetic measurements are
   used as the basis for classifying catchment sediment sources and tracing
   sediment movements through time. Records of magnetic susceptibility for
   monthly sediment trap samples (1998-99) track seasonal discharge,
   peaking in winter and spring. Magnetic records in lake sediment cores
   are compared against and tuned to precipitation records to provide dated
   proxy records for past discharge spanning sub-annual to decadal time
   scales back to 1826. Calculated sediment accumulation rates in lake
   sediment cores are used as proxies for time-averaged catchment sediment
   load. Analysis of the results reveals that climate and land-use controls
   on the hydrological and sediment system are complex and vary according
   to the time scale of observation. In general, cycles of agricultural
   expansion and deforestation appear to have been the major cause of
   shifts in the sediment system through the late Holocene. Deforestation
   in the 18th century may have caused a number of high-magnitude flood and
   erosion events. As the time scale of observation becomes shorter,
   changes in climate and hydro-meteorological conditions become
   progressively more important. Since the mid-19th century, smoothed
   records of discharge roughly follow annual precipitation; this is in
   contrast to sediment load, which follows the trend of declining land-use
   pressures. Episodic erosion events during this recent period seem to be
   linked to geomorphic evidence for slope instability in the montane and
   sub-alpine zones, triggered by intense summer rainfall. At the annual
   scale, changes in seasonal rainfall become paramount in determining
   sediment movement to downstream locations. The study demonstrates that
   the connections between forcings and responses span a four-dimensional
   array of temporal and spatial scales, with strong evidence for
   dominantly nonlinear forcing-response mechanisms. Copyright (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Since European settlement began 180 years ago, the sediment flux in the
   upper Murrumbidgee River, NSW, Australia, has changed as a result of
   grazing, historical climate variations, and dam closures. Of these, the
   introduction of grazing stock, which triggered widespread gully erosion,
   has had the largest effect, increasing the sediment flux by a factor of
   more than 150. In comparison, multi-decadal variations in rainfall cause
   less than a twofold increase in the sediment transport capacity of the
   river, and the effects of dam closures are significant only in some
   reaches. At the time of settlement, vegetated shallow valley floor
   depressions were common and many of the creeks, and streams consisted of
   deep pools linked by shallow vegetated zones. Much of the main channel
   of the river was cobble and gravel bedded. The sediment flux out of this
   10 500 km(2) catchment prior to settlement is estimated to have been
   very low, similar to2400 t year(-1). Degradation of the vegetated valley
   bottoms by introduced stock in the 1840s and 1850s triggered a massive
   phase of gully erosion. Over the next 40 to 50 years the erosion rates
   in the headwater areas increased by a factor of nearly 245, and similar
   to43 000 000 t of sediment was generated. We estimate that, during this
   period, gully erosion increased the sediment flux out of the catchment
   by a factor of about 200 to similar to480 000 t year(-1). As the gully
   networks reached maximum extension, sediment yield from the headwater
   areas declined by a factor of similar to40 and are now estimated to be
   about six times the pre-European rates. Interestingly, sediment yield
   from the whole catchment declined only by a factor of two to similar
   to100 times the pre-European rates (250 000 t year(-1)). We attribute
   this difference to an increase in the efficiency of sediment delivery
   through the stream network. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The Rhine river system can look back on a long history of human impact.
   Whereas significant anthropogenic changes to the river channel started
   only 200 years ago, the impacts of land use have been felt for more than
   7500 years. Here, we review results from several case studies and show
   how land-use change and climate impacts have transformed the fluvial
   system. We focus on changes in sediment delivery pathways and
   slope-channel coupling, and show that these vary in time and depend on
   the magnitude of a rainfall event. These changes must be accounted for
   when trying to use sediments as archives of land-use change and climatic
   impacts on fluvial systems. For example, human impact is recorded in
   slope deposits only as long as rainfall intensity and runoff generation
   do not exceed the threshold for gullying. Similarly, climatic impacts
   are only recorded in alluvium when both the landscape is rendered
   sensitive by human activities (e.g. deforestation) and rainfall
   thresholds for gullying are exceeded. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley

Abstract = {{During the 1970s and 1980s the techniques of tillage and the area of
   cultivation on the Russian Plain remained virtually unchanged.
   Therefore, it is possible to assess both the rate and forms of erosion
   and sedimentation over almost all of the plain for this period of
   several decades. Using the SHI model and USLE, with coefficients derived
   for Russian conditions, observed gully density, area and volume, and a
   morphogenetic classification of streams, it has been possible to produce
   an assessment of the current state of erosion and sedimentation. The
   geographic patterns of both the rates and types of erosion and
   sedimentation are presented and partially explained. This assessment
   will be of considerable value as a `baseline' against which to assess
   future changes as the area of cultivation and the methods of farming
   change, as well as to assess historical erosion and deposition.

Abstract = {{The processes of sheet, rill and gully erosion on the slopes of the
   Russian Plain are controlled by the same factors as elsewhere: cover,
   erodibility, erosivity and landform. The combination of land-use history
   and variations in these bio-physical factors produced a history of
   erosion that is unique to this area. The most eroded soils occur in the
   Non-Black Earth area, especially where there are soddy-podzolic soils.
   Over the entire Russian Plain, 99 x 10(9) m(3) of soil have been lost
   from the slopes since AD 1696. On the arable land, a layer <10 cm thick
   has been lost from 82\% of the area, a layer 10-20 cm thick has been
   removed from 11\% of the area, and on about 1\% of the area >40 cm has
   been eroded. About 2 x 10(6) gullies more than 300 m in length have
   formed during the last 300 years, mobilizing about 4 x 109 m(3) of
   sediment. About 97\% of this vast amount of soil has been redeposited on
   the plain rather than transported to the oceans. The effect of the
   sediment on stream channels has been greatest in the headwaters, where
   large numbers of low-order channels have been completely infilled. Up to
   5.6 m of sediment has accumulated in some of these small valleys.

Abstract = {{Analysis of the sedimentary record has been used to determine the
   historical sedimentation rate in the lower Yellow River and the
   historical literature has been studied to obtain information on climate
   change and human activities. Based on the data obtained, the temporal
   variation in the sedimentation rate in the lower Yellow River over the
   past 2300 years has been studied in relation to climate change and the
   impact of human activities. The results indicate that the response of
   the sedimentation zone of Yellow River system to changes in the erosion
   zone are consistent with existing understanding. Changes in vegetation
   and land use, both related to climate change and human activities, are
   two major controls responsible for the increase in sedimentation rates.
   Additionally, the changing strategies for harnessing of the lower Yellow
   River are also responsible for such acceleration. With the trend of
   accelerated sedimentation in the past 2300 years, the period from the
   7th to 10th centuries and the period since the mid-19th century have
   been identified as two periods in which abrupt changes occurred.

Abstract = {{The process of water delivery to a headwater stream in a hypermaritime
   rainforest was examined using a variety of physical techniques and
   tracing with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the stable isotopes of
   water. Headwater swamps, often the major discharge zones for water
   draining off steep forest slopes, strongly affect the physical and
   chemical character of streamflow in the region. The headwater swamp
   selected for detailed investigation was sustained by relatively constant
   groundwater input from the steep colluvial slopes that maintained the
   water table above the ground surface. During significant storm events
   the water table rose quickly and the swamp expanded to engulf marginal
   pools that developed rapidly on the adjacent ground surfaces. The
   corresponding release of surface water directly to the stream typically
   comprised up to 95\% of total stream discharge. The proportion of
   groundwater seepage to the stream by matrix flow (<1\%) and via
   macropore-fed springs (up to 73\%) increased during the recession
   period, but could not be sustained over the longer term. In more
   protracted drying periods, deep groundwater contributions to the stream
   were routed first to the headwater swamp.
   Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the stream, measured daily or more
   frequently during storm events, was found to be directly proportional to
   discharge, owing to the domination of DOC-rich headwater-swamp water
   sources. Although delta(18)O and delta(2)H composition of rainwater,
   groundwater and stream flow were found to be similar, deuterium excess
   (d = delta(2)H - 8delta(18)O) of water components was often found to be
   distinct, and suggested short water residence times of roughly 12 days
   for one event. Overall, observations of a typical headwater swamp reveal
   that the groundwater regime is dominated by rapid infiltration and
   short, emergent flow paths. With a relatively short turnover time,
   potential disturbances to the system by harvesting of upslope areas can
   be expected to occur rapidly. Forest managers can mitigate some of the
   harmful effects of logging operations by respecting the integrity of
   headwater wetland systems. The nature and magnitude of such
   perturbations will require further study. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley

Abstract = {{The effect of drought on groundwater heads and discharge is often
   complex and poorly understood. Therefore the propagation of a drought
   from groundwater recharge to discharge and the influence of aquifer
   characteristics on the propagation was analysed by tracking a drought in
   recharge through a linear reservoir. The recharge was defined as a
   sinusoid function with a period of 1 year. The decrease in recharge
   owing to drought was simulated by multiplying the recharge during 1 year
   with a drought fraction between 0 and 1, which represents a decrease in
   the recharge of 100 to 0\%, respectively. The droughts were identified
   using the threshold level approach, with a threshold that is constant in
   time. For this case analytical formulations were derived, which express
   the drought duration and deficit in the groundwater discharge in terms
   of the decrease in recharge, the reservoir coefficient that
   characterizes aquifer properties and the height of the threshold level.
   The results showed that the delay in the groundwater system caused a
   shift of the main part of the decrease in recharge from the high-flow to
   the low-flow period. This resulted in an increase in drought deficit for
   discharge compared with the drought deficit for recharge. Also the
   development of multiyear droughts caused an increase in drought deficit.
   The attenuation in the groundwater system caused a decrease in drought
   deficit. In most cases the net effect of these processes was an increase
   of drought deficit as a result of the propagation through groundwater.
   Only for small droughts the deficit decreased from recharge to
   discharge. The amount of increase or decrease depends on the reservoir
   coefficient and the severity of the drought. Under most conditions a
   maximum in the drought deficit occurred for a reservoir coefficient of
   around 200 days. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

   0-2(.)5 and 0-5(.)0 cm, surface temperature, and temperatures at 1, 5
   and 10 cm depths are analysed. The relationship between the soil
   moisture and the temperature variability in time is examined as a
   function of vegetation type and location. Results from these experiments
   show that, during drydown, surface temperature shows an increase that
   corresponds to a decrease in the soil moisture. Linear models for
   prediction of soil moisture (at both depths) using surface temperature

Abstract = {{In this study. a generalized contaminant retardation factor applicable
   to a multiphase system where various types of colloids exist
   simultaneously with contaminants is derived and incorporated into an
   equilibrium model which is successfully applied to experimental data for
   which phenanthrene was used as hydrophobic organic contaminants and
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) or bacteria as mobile carriers. Based on
   the parameter values for the experimental data regarding the association
   of phenanthrene with solid matrix, DOM and various bacterial isolates,
   numerical experiments are performed to examine the transport behaviour
   of hydrophobic organic contaminants in various types of the multiphase
   system. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the extent of contaminant
   transport enhancement depends on the adsorption affinity of the colloid,
   its concentration and its mobility, and that the importance of a third
   phase to contaminant transport needs to be evaluated carefully with
   respect to the relevance of experimental conditions applied to realistic
   environmental conditions. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The nature of the water-air temperature relationship, and its moderation
   by discharge, were investigated for catchments ranging in size from 2.1
   to 601 km(2) in the Exe basin, Devon, UK and for data relating to
   hourly, daily and weekly time bases. The sensitivity and explanatory
   power of simple water-air temperature regression models based on hourly
   data were improved by incorporation of a lag, which increased with
   catchment size, although relationships became more sensitive and less
   scattered as the time base of data increased from hourly to weekly mean
   values. Significant departures from linearity in water-air temperature
   relationships were evident for hourly, but not for daily mean or weekly
   mean, data. A clear tendency for relationships between water and air
   temperatures to be stronger and more sensitive for flows below median
   levels was apparent, and multiple regression analysis also revealed
   water temperature to be inversely related to discharge for all
   catchments and time-scales. However, discharge had a greater impact in
   accounting for water temperature variation at shorter time-scales and in
   larger catchments. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the applicability of neural network (NN) modelling
   for forecasting and filtering problems. The multilayer feedforward
   (MLFF) network was first constructed to forecast the tidal-level
   variations at the mouth of the River Chao Phraya in Thailand. Unlike the
   well-known conventional harmonic analysis, the NN model uses a set of
   previous data for learning and then forecasting directly the time-series
   of tidal levels. It was found that lead time of I to 24 hourly tidal
   levels can be predicted successfully using only a short-time hourly
   learning data. The MLFF network was further used to establish a
   stage-discharge relationship for the tidal river. The results show a
   considerably better performance of the NN model over the conventional
   models. In addition, the stage-discharge relationship obtained by the NN
   model can indicate reasonably well the important behaviour of the tidal
   influences. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The suspended sediment yield and the transfer of polluted sediment are
   investigated for the Puyango river basin in southern Ecuador. This river
   system receives metal (Cd, Cu, Hg, Ph and Zn) and cyanide pollution
   generated by mining. and is associated with large-scale hydrological
   variability, which is partly governed by El Ni (n) over tildeo events.
   Field sampling and statistical modelling methods are used to quantify
   the amount of mine tailings that is discharged into the basin. Annual
   suspended sediment yields are estimated using a novel combination of the
   suspended sediment rating method and Monte Carlo simulations, which
   allow for propagation of the uncertainties of the calculations that lead
   to final load estimates. Geochemical analysis of suspended and river bed
   sediment is used to assess the dispersion and long-term fate of
   contaminated sediment within the river catchment. Knowledge of the
   inter- and intra-annual variation in suspended sediment yield is shown
   to be crucial for judging the importance of mining discharges, and the
   extent to which the resultant pollution is diluted by river flows. In
   wet years, polluted sediments represent only a very small proportion of
   the yield estimates, but in dry years the proportion can be significant.
   Evidence shows that metal contaminated sediments are stored in the
   Puyango river bed during low flows. Large flood events flush this
   sediment periodically, both on an annual cycle associated with the rainy
   season, and also related to El Ni (n) over tildeo events. Therefore,
   environmental impacts of mining-related discharges are more likely to be
   severe during dry years compared with wet years, and in the dry season
   rather than the wet season. The hydrological consequences of El Ni (n)
   over tildeo events are shown to depend upon the extent to which these
   events penetrate inland. It is, thus, shown that the general conclusion
   that El Ni (n) over tildeo events can significantly affect suspended
   sediment yields needs evaluation with respect to the particular way in
   which those events affect a given catchment. Copyright (C) 2003 John

Abstract = {{Both water and heat balances were studied in a conifer plantation
   watershed in south-west Japan, within the warm-temperate East Asia
   monsoon area. Forest cover in the watershed consists mainly of Japanese
   cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) and Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa)
   plantations. Precipitation and runoff have been observed since 1991, so
   evapotranspiration can be compared with the water balance. Two
   meteorological observation towers were built to monitor
   evapotranspiration in the watershed. The annual average precipitation,
   amount of runoff and losses were 2166, 1243 and 923 mm, respectively.
   The evapotranspiration (latent heat flux) agreed well with the water
   balance losses. The average annual evapotranspiration at the tower built
   in the centre of the watershed was 902 mm; evapotranspiration at the
   other tower, further upslope, was 875 mm. The observed
   evapotranspiration was 39\% to 40\% of the average precipitation (2166
   mm). The mean net radiation was c. 2.6 GJ m(-2) year(-1), and is
   considered a representative value of the net radiation (Rn) in
   coniferous plantations in this region. This region is classified in the
   humid zone based on the ratio of net radiation (Rn) to the energy
   required to evaporate the rainfall (lambdaR). The mean annual
   evaporation of canopy-intercepted water was 356 mm or about 15\% of the
   average precipitation. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A simulation and optimization model was developed and applied to an
   irrigated area in Delta, Utah to optimize the economic benefit, simulate
   the water demand, and search the related crop area percentages with
   specified water supply and planted area constraints. The user inter-face
   model begins with the weather generation submodel, which produces daily
   weather data, which is based on long-term monthly average and standard
   deviation data from Delta, Utah. To simulate the daily crop water demand
   and relative crop yield for seven crops in two command areas, the
   information provided by this submodel was applied to the on-farm
   irrigation scheduling submodel. Furthermore, to optimize the project
   benefit by searching for the best allocation of planted crop areas given
   the constraints of projected water supply, the results were employed in
   the genetic algorithm submodel. Optimal planning for the 394.6-ha area
   of the Delta irrigation project is projected to produce the maximum
   economic benefit. That is, projected profit equals U\$\$113 826 and
   projected water demand equals 3(.)03 x 10(6) m(3). Also, area
   percentages of crops within UCA\#2 command area are 70(.)1\%, 19\% and
   10(.)9\% for alfalfa, barley and corn, respectively, and within UCA\#4
   command area are 41.5\%, 38(.)9\%, 14(.)4\% and 5(.)2\% for alfalfa,
   barley, corn and wheat, respectively. As this model can plan irrigation
   application depths and allocate crop areas for optimal economic benefit,
   it can thus be applied to many irrigation projects. Copyright (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Hydrological and water resources issues appear very differently in
   different regions, and are strongly affected by geographical conditions.
   Hydrological knowledge and methodologies obtained in a specific region
   cannot necessarily be adapted to other regions. The purpose of this
   paper is to clarify one way to address adequately the regional
   characteristics of hydrology and water resources in monsoon Asia,
   especially the `too much water' problems in the region. For this
   purpose, geomorphological factors, climatic factors and human
   intervention in the natural environment are taken into consideration as
   the three major factors governing the regional characteristics of the
   hydrology-water resources system. To identify geomorphological features
   macroscopically between the Asia Pacific region and other continental
   regions, the concepts `tectonic zone' and `stable region', which are two
   major subdivisions of continental masses in the world, are introduced.
   Also, a new climatic subdivision termed `warm-humid' is proposed to
   express the abundant precipitation due to the Asian monsoon. Then,
   hydrological characteristics common or similar in `warm-humid tectonic
   zones' in the Asia Pacific region, contrasted with those in stable
   regions, are enumerated together with the human intervention
   corresponding to these characteristics, and research targets peculiar to
   warm-humid tectonic zones are discussed. Finally, the establishment of a
   standing research community called `Asia Pacific Association of
   Hydrology and Water Resources' is proposed to promote the exchange of
   operational knowledge and experience in water resources management,
   cooperative research activities, and professional education in the Asia
   Pacific region. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated Water Resources Management is an approach aimed at achieving
   sustainable development with a focus on water resources. This management
   concept is characterized by its catchment approach, inter-sectoral and
   interdisciplinary approach and multiple management objectives. There is
   an effort to widen the management scope to include multiple resources
   and environmental considerations in the river basin management schemes.
   In order to achieve river basin management objectives and multiple
   global environmental benefits, an ecosystem approach to river basin
   management is promoted. The Ecosystem-based River Basin Management aims
   to maximize and optimize the total value of the ecosystem functions
   relevant to classified ecosystems within a river basin by conserving and
   even enhancing these functions for the next generations. A procedure to
   incorporate such ecosystem functions into policy framework is presented
   in this paper. Based on this policy framework of the Ecosystem-based
   River Basin Management, a case study is introduced to apply the concept
   to the Yangtze River basin. According to the United Nations Environment
   Programme (UNEP) assessment report, this basin suffers from frequent
   floods of large magnitudes, which are due to the degradation of
   ecosystem functions in the basin. In this case, the government of the
   People's Republic of China introduced Ecosystem Function Conservation
   Areas to conserve ecosystem functions related to flood events and
   magnitude, such as soil conservation, agricultural practices and
   forestry, while producing economic benefits for the local population.

Abstract = {{The Numata Dam, planned for the Tone River basin of Gunma Prefecture,
   was the largest dam construction project ever considered in Japan. This
   dam construction project, however, did not materialize. The proposal for
   the Numata Dam was first launched in 1959, at a time when the Tokyo
   Metropolitan area was mushrooming, both in population and industrial
   activity. The Numata Dam was supposed to be a prioritized dam
   construction project to alleviate the then anticipated water shortage in
   the Tokyo Metropolitan area. The Numata Dam plan experienced fierce
   opposition from those who would have been obliged to resettle, whereas
   those in Tokyo and the surrounding metropolitan area welcomed the plan.
   The major concern of the planned Numata Dam was the number of
   resettlers, which was then estimated to be around 3000 families. The
   resettlement plan developed for the Numata Dam included some innovative
   concepts, which may be applicable even today, for dam construction
   projects in the developing world. The plan included such ideas as (a)
   having resettlers share existing farmland with the present owners
   provided improvements were made to increase productivity, (b) paying
   `rent' to resettlers, and (c) establishing the Tone River Development
   Agency. After more than a decade of debate, both at national and local
   levels, the Numata Dam project was finally discarded through a decision
   of the Prime Minister in 1972. The resettlement schemes elaborated for
   the Numata Dam still appear to be innovative. Such schemes may be
   applied to projects in the developing world, in particular, in nations
   that are about to `take off' with economic development. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The World Commission on Dams (WCD) published `Dams and Development' as
   its only and final report in November 2000. Identifying `core values'
   and `strategic priorities', the report proposed `internationally
   acceptable criteria and standards'. Despite the fact that the WCD itself
   did not intend that the report be used as a blueprint, many
   non-governmental organizations strongly support the report and the
   criteria and guidelines recommended in the report, and demand that they
   be adopted in their current form by funding organizations. The WCD
   criteria and guidelines were found to have several `methodological'
   problems, and it appears impossible to apply the recommended criteria
   and guidelines as they stand. This study examines the applicability of
   the WCD criteria and guidelines for public financing institutes involved
   in overseas development assistance and proposes necessary measures to
   increase their applicability in order to realize core values and
   strategic priorities. The character of and relationships among key
   decision points, strategic priorities, criteria, and guidelines should
   be clarified. Then, this study examines the applicability of the WCD
   recommendations for Japanese public financial institutions, as Japan has
   nearly become the sole bilateral donor providing financial assistance
   (loans) for large dam construction projects. The public financial
   institution can only be mandated to check the legal status of the
   decisions made regarding Stages I and 2 which are the first two of the
   five successive stages from the planning to the operation of the dam
   project. Needs assessment and alternative selection are expected to be
   conducted at Stage I and 2 respectively. The Japan Bank for
   International Cooperation (JBIC), which deals with the Japanese
   concessional yen loan, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency
   (JICA), which is in charge of technical assistance, are featured in this
   study. As for the Japanese concessional yen loan assistance, there are
   other inherent problems for adopting the recommendations. First, it is
   not clear which government agency officially and substantially carries
   the decision-making responsibility. Second, JBIC may be involved only
   when Stage 2 has been completed, and it should be decided and clarified
   to what extent the Japanese government, as well as JIBC and JICA, should
   be involved in Stages I and 2 (2A: intensive studies on alternatives) of
   a project for which funding is requested. These issues need to be solved
   if the Japanese government wishes to adopt the recommendations.

Abstract = {{One of the fundamental tenets of the sustainable development concept is
   the maintenance of a homeostatic equilibrium within the ecosystem.
   Overexploitation of the ecosystem or degradation of its biotic structure
   alters ecosystem processes to the point whereby the ability of the
   ecosystem to produce desired resources is seriously diminished. Water is
   the medium for all ecological processes, from molecular to global scale.
   The physical quantification of ecological processes in terms of energy
   and molecular dimension is fundamental for scientific investigation and
   sound ecosystem management. As a consequence, the water mesocycle within
   the basin and connected processes (i.e. those which can be measured)
   should be considered as the basic unit for the analysis of
   energy-water-biota interactions.
   The degradation of freshwater ecosystems can be characterized in terms
   of two dimensions: first, pollution, which can be reduced to a
   significant extent by technologies; and second, the degradation of
   established water and nutrient cycles within the ecosystem as a whole.
   This second dimension is much more complex. A new approach for solving
   both of these problems is the application of ecohydrology and
   phytotechnology. Our progressive understanding of the range of
   anthropogenic degradation of hydrological, biogeochemical and biological
   processes within water basins indicates the need to control and regulate
   nutrients and water dynamics by increasing plant biomass and diversity.
   Thus, phytotechnologies, applied within the context of ecohydrological
   principles, can provide an approach for increasing ecosystem carrying
   capacity and enhancing the resilience and functionality of ecosystems at
   the basin scale.
   The application of these interdisciplinary, holistic approaches, based
   on an understanding of the role of plant biomass in the control of water
   and biogeochemical cycles (i.e. `green feedback'), can lead to an
   improvement of water resources quality, as well as the enhancement of
   system biodiversity, agricultural production, and bioenergy generation,
   with the potential for increased employment opportunities. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Many factors influence water quality within a reservoir. Deforestation,
   excessive erosion, introduction of new species, domestic and industrial
   waste disposal and agricultural runoff are only a few examples.
   It is well known by specialists in water resources management that water
   levels in a reservoir may also affect its quality. But how these
   processes occur and how appropriate water levels can be maintained are
   very hard questions to answer. This is because of the physical and
   biological processes occurring inside the water body, and also due to
   the various demands from society concerning water uses.
   Nowadays, through the use of models, knowledge of some of the conditions
   can enable us to predict future conditions. In many cases, reservoir
   models, such as physical models for water quality, may predict the
   future water quality situation. These models have been used successfully
   to enhance knowledge about the interactions among the different parts
   inherent to the water systems.
   Through the combination of water quality and optimization models, this
   study proposes a suitable methodology for the assessment of planning
   operations of a storage reservoir. The purpose of this paper is to
   consider a multipurpose reservoir, under different water demands and
   uses from societies, concerning reservoir water quality.
   The proposed optimization is realized through the use of dynamic
   programming combined with stochastic techniques that can handle the
   probabilistic characteristics of inflow quantity and quality. For the
   water quality assessment, the UNEP/ILEC one-dimensional model with two
   layers called PAMOLARE is applied. Finally, sensitivity analysis is
   carried out using a genetic algorithm model. Copyright (C) 2003 John

Abstract = {{The seasonal variation of the quality of stream water in a snowy
   temperate area, where rain or temporary warming can cause frequent
   melting at the surface of snow cover, even in mid-winter, was studied.
   Monthly runoff is highest in the snowmelt seasons March and April, and
   lowest in November. Since floods in the rainy season or in the autumn
   rainy period take place irregularly, they contribute little to monthly
   runoff. In winter, as with the snowmelt season, the proportion of HCO3-
   in stream water is relatively low, while the proportions of Cl-, NO3-
   and SO42- are relatively high. In mid-winter and during the snowmelt
   season, the amount of each ion clearly indicates that stream water
   quality is strongly influenced by snow meltwater. Copyright (C) 2003

Abstract = {{A spatially distributed Xinanjiang model (DXAJ) has been developed to
   simulate the hourly hydrological process of a storm event caused by
   Typhoon No. I I during the period of the 22-23 August 2001 in the
   Kamafusa Lake catchment, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. The catchment is
   divided into 50 x 50 m 2 grid cells, and the runoff generation component
   of the Xinanjiang rainfall-runoff model is applied to each grid cell. An
   optimal routing order approach is used to implement the distributed
   routing, i.e. the runoff generated in each grid cell is routed together
   with upstream inflow from upstream grid cells to downstream grid cells
   according to the optimal routing order, which is derived from a
   simulated stream network. One process-based soil erosion model is
   coupled onto this distributed hydrological model to simulate suspended
   solids generation in each grid cell and generated suspended solids are
   routed together with runoff from upstream grid cells to downstream grid
   cells. The simulation results are in good agreement with the observed
   hydrograph and pollutograph. The soil erosion simulation was improved
   through the consideration of rainfall intensity in the soil erosion

Abstract = {{Estimates of the amount of recession flow can be derived from streamflow
   records. Such estimates are critical in the assessment of low flow
   characteristics for the Blue Nile River, from which about two-thirds of
   the irrigation requirements in Sudan are satisfied. The recession flow

   outflow model using an iterative algorithm. An analytical model to
   forecast the Blue Nile recession flow is developed and the performance
   of the model is compared to the previous Blue Nile recession flow model.
   In the proposed model, a simple linear regression equation is introduced
   to illustrate the effect of antecedent flow on the recession parameter.
   Results indicate that the model can provide a simple and reliable method
   to predict the recession flow of the Blue Nile River. Copyright (C) 2003

Abstract = {{In order to gain an insight into the effects of air temperature on river
   water quality, data were statistically analysed using meteorological and
   river water quality data. Two types of data set were used for river
   water temperature. One type involved five sampling points within
   different rivers where water temperature data were obtained daily, and
   the other involved 82 sampling points located within 27 rivers where
   water temperature and other water quality data were obtained monthly.
   Influential factors for different time scales were investigated. From
   the analyses, the gradient of water temperature to air temperature
   considered on a daily scale was 0.1-0.5 degreesC degreesC(-1) and was
   influenced by the hydrological scale of the river basin. The gradient
   observed using an annual scale was 0.5-1.5 degrees'C degreesC(-1) and
   was supposed to be influenced by solar radiation. Under the condition
   that solar radiation is constant, the gradient on an annual scale was
   predicted to be less than unity (0.5-0.85 degreesC degreesC(-1)). As for
   the other indices, from the analysis on an annual scale, an increase in
   air temperature resulted in an increase in biological oxygen demand and
   suspended solids, and a decrease in dissolved oxygen in almost all
   rivers. Based on the results, it was suggested that global warming has a
   deteriorating effect on river water quality. Copyright (C) 2003 John

Abstract = {{Continental scale hydrological models are important for improving the
   land surface scheme of the General Circulation Model (GCM) and for
   downscaling applications of GCM predictions for regional water resources
   assessment. A grid-based distributed hydrological modelling approach
   cannot be applied at a continental scale by simply increasing the grid
   size due to factors such as the spatial heterogeneity and nonlinear
   nature of soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer processes. Sub-grid
   parameterization is required to capture the spatial variability of
   hydrological behaviour within a large grid. On the other hand, water
   resources management is usually implemented at the basin scale. The
   methodology presented in this study expands a grid-based distributed
   hydrological model to the continental scale, and addresses both sub-grid
   hydrological parameterization and basin-based water resources
   assessment. A continental scale model with a 0.5degrees spatial
   resolution is developed based on a number of available global data sets.
   The model performance is examined through application to the Asian
   Continent. The regional and temporal variability of hydrological
   characteristics and water resources is discussed in this paper.

Abstract = {{Hydrometeorological cycles over and and semi-arid regions in
   mid-latitude Eurasia (the Silk Road region) were investigated using
   meteorological reanalysis data for the period 1979-93, available from
   the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).
   Results show that seasonal changes of moisture balance in Turkey and
   central Asia, hereafter referred to as the western region, differ from
   those in the Taklimakan Desert and Loess Plateau, hereafter referred to
   as the eastern region. Here, we equate evaporation minus precipitation
   with the divergence field of the vertically integrated water vapour
   flux. In the western region, precipitation and positive convergence C of
   moisture primarily occurs during October-March. In contrast, the eastern
   region receives precipitation and has its positive C occurring during
   June-August. As a result, the eastern region has nearly simultaneous
   seasonal peaks in precipitation P and evapotranspiration E, whereas the
   western region has minimum P and maximum E in summer.
   The main annual moisture route for the Silk Road region is from the west
   to east; however, moisture also comes from the north in July. Over
   Turkey, moisture arrives from the west and south. In central Asia,
   however, most of the moisture comes from the west, the convergence peaks
   in March, and moisture from the south and west is also greater during
   this month. In the Loess Plateau, moisture enters from the west, the
   north, and the south, and exits to the east. In July, the peak
   precipitation and convergence season, all moisture flows are greater for
   the entire region, and a large influx of moisture from the south occurs
   during the summer season. The moisture from the south, the monsoonal
   flow, has a large interannual variability. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley

Abstract = {{This paper outlines specifications and gives preliminary results of
   aircraft observations made during the Intensive Observation Period in
   2000 (IOP2000) over the Yakutsk area of eastern Siberia. The
   observations were part of the GAME-Siberia project. Spatial and seasonal
   variation in the fluxes of sensible heat, latent heat, and carbon
   dioxide were determined using a Russian aircraft equipped with
   turbulence sensors. Two flight paths covered 12 x 32 kin 2 grids over
   heterogeneous forest and grass surfaces on the left- and right-hand
   banks of the Lena River. The spatial flux distributions were consistent
   with the underlying vegetation cover. A video camera recorded aerial
   images of the land, while a spectrometer observed the spectral
   reflectance of the land surface. These data helped describe the
   relationship between the atmosphere and the land surface. The vertical
   structure of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) was also observed on
   long flight paths between the left and right banks of the Lena River.
   Thermally induced internal boundary layers (TIBLs) developed in the ABL
   under different thermal and dynamic conditions near the Lena River. The
   horizontal and vertical distributions of sensible and latent heats in
   the ABL were consistent with the generation of cumulus, which appeared
   over the forested area, but not over the Lena River lowland. Copyright

Abstract = {{A GIS-based RUSLE model is employed to study the global soil erosion
   potential for viewing the present situation, analysing changes over the
   past century, and projecting future trends with reference to global
   changes in land use and climate. Scenarios considered in the study
   include historical, present and future conditions of cropland and
   climate. This research gives the first overview of the global situation
   of soil erosion potential considering the previous century as well as
   the present and future. Present soil erosion potential is estimated to
   be about 0.38 mm year(-1) for the globe, with Southeast Asia found to be
   the most seriously affected region in the world. It is estimated that
   nearly 60\% of present soil erosions are induced by human activity. With
   development of cropland in the last century, soil erosion potential is
   estimated to have increased by about 17\%. Global warming might
   significantly increase the potential for soil erosion, and the regions
   with the same increasing trend of precipitation and population might
   face much more serious problems related to soil erosion in the future.

Abstract = {{Arid and semi-arid regions are very vulnerable to environmental changes.
   Climate change studies indicate that the environment in such areas will
   steadily deteriorate with global warming; inland lakes will shrink and
   desert areas will expand. Mongolia is a landlocked country in
   north-central Asia that contains a unique ecological system consisting
   of taiga, steppe, and desert from north to south. The Selenge River
   basin (280000 km(2)) in northern Mongolia is a semi-arid region
   underlain by permafrost, between latitudes 46 and 52degreesN, and
   longitudes 96 and 109degreesE. The issue of sustainable development of
   the basin is very important owing to its limited natural resources,
   including fresh water, forest, and rangeland. To examine the water cycle
   processes in the basin, a hydrological analysis was carried out using a
   simple scheme for the interaction between the land surface and
   atmosphere (big-leaf model) coupled to a hydrological model for the
   period 1988-92 to estimate the hydrological regime of the basin. Annual
   precipitation in this period averaged 298 mm, ranging from 212 to 352 mm
   at a 1degrees x 1degrees resolution based on data from 10 gauges, and
   the estimated annual evapotranspiration averaged 241 turn, ranging
   between 153 and 300 mm. This indicates that evapotranspiration accounts
   for the overwhelming majority of the annual precipitation, averaging
   81\% and ranging between 64 and 96\%. The annual potential
   evapotranspiration in the basin averaged 2009 mm; the ratio of
   evapotranspiration (actual to potential evapotranspiration) was 0.12 and
   the wetness index (annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration)
   was 0.15. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The formation process of three gyres in Lake Biwa, as observed using an
   acoustic Doppler current profiler, is simulated using three different
   SGS models: Smagorinsky Model, Dynamic Mixed Model (DMM) and Mixed
   Scaling Formulation Model (MSFM) based on very large eddy simulation
   (VLES). The driving force of gyre formation is assumed to be
   differential heating due to heat volume differences between the middle
   lake and shoreline areas. This condition is created in the simulation by
   setting the initial temperature distribution in the lake based on field
   observation data. The significant patterns of gyre formation are
   calculated both by DNM and MSFM. Owing to the huge disproportion of
   horizontal and vertical grid spacing, the isotropic subgrid scale (SGS)
   model (such as the Smagorinsky model) does not perform well when using
   normal grid spacing. According to the comparison between field
   observation data and numerical simulation, it is concluded that the
   surface heat transfer process is one of the main driving forces for gyre
   formation in Lake Biwa. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The main goal of this study is to evaluate the eutrophication status
   under different management approaches in a basin, by combining the
   Biwa3D model (three-dimensional eutrophication analysis model) with
   several nutrient-reduction cases to calculate their effects on the water
   quality in Lake Biwa, Japan, and by applying the model to evaluate the
   cost-effectiveness between different scenarios designed to control
   eutrophication. A non-hydrostatic hydrodynamic model featuring very
   large eddy simulation (VLES) concepts, combined with ecological
   components that consider three types of phytoplankton species, one
   zooplankton, and nutrient cycling in each grid, is developed as the
   basic component of the research. Nitrogen and phosphorus loads from I I
   I sub-basins that supply Lake Biwa are set as the boundary condition for
   the numerical simulation. The chlorophyll a concentration calculated
   near the water intake, weighted in proportion to the intake discharge,
   is set as the water quality index. Transferable discharge permits are
   introduced for estimating the total reduction cost for achieving the
   objective water quality. Two types of scenario are tested: one considers
   the difference in location of nutrient reduction in the north and south
   basins, and the other ignores this difference. Initially, the effect of
   nutrient loads on the water quality of Lake Biwa was calculated using
   the Biwa3D model, using estimated nitrogen and phosphorus loads from the
   basin as the boundary condition. Transferable discharge permits were
   then designed according to the impact factor on each basin calculated by
   the model in order to compare the cost-effectiveness of the reduction
   scenarios. It is concluded that consideration of the characteristics of
   each basin and the distribution of effluent in designing transferable
   discharge permits reduces the total costs by around 4-25\% of that
   required for achieving the target concentration of chlorophyll a.

Abstract = {{Hydraulic fracturing or hydraulic stimulation is one of the most
   effective methods of enhancing hot dry rock (HDR) geothermal system
   productivity. The 3D structure of the fractured rock is approximated by
   the network models of `fractal geometry'. The models of fracture
   networks are generated by distributing fractures randomly in space and
   assuming the fractal correlation N-r = Cr-D that incorporates the number
   of fractures N-r, fractal length r, fractal dimension D and fracture
   density within the rock mass C. This procedure makes it possible to
   characterize the geothermal reservoirs using parameters measured from
   field data. Based on this approach, a mathematical model of the
   hydraulic rock fracturing is proposed. The model incorporates
   approximations of the fracture mechanical behaviour drawn from the rock
   mechanics literature, a very simplified analysis of the operative
   physical processes and mapping of the connectivity of fracture network
   to a cubic regular grid. Along with the fractal-type distribution of the
   fracture lengths, the fracture surfaces are also assumed to follow
   fractal geometry. The latter allows numerical simulation of the natural
   rock fracture dilation caused by fracture shear offset. The other
   problem that can be resolved by fracture surface modelling is the
   apparent limitation on the number of fractures that can be analysed
   experimentally. In this respect, the suggested mathematical model can be
   used to simulate fractal surfaces identical to fractures found in the
   natural rocks. Taken together, these tools permit the approximate
   engineering resolution of the multi-parametric, highly complex
   mechanical problem. The reliability of the developed model was validated
   by comparisons with the experimentally determined data for the Hijiori
   deep reservoir. This implicitly justifies the numerical results and
   conclusions drawn in the present research. In particular, a series of
   computations indicate that the connectivity of the fracture network is
   greatly affected by the fractal dimension of the fracture network. The
   strong effect of the fractal dimension on the reservoir's size is also
   observed. The numerical results illustrate the controlling effect of the
   pressure and flow rate in the stimulating well for reservoir growth.

Abstract = {{A terrestrial hydrological model, developed to simulate the
   high-latitude water cycle, is described, along with comparisons with
   observed data across the pan-Arctic drainage basin. Gridded fields of
   plant rooting depth, soil characteristics (texture, organic content),
   vegetation, and daily time series of precipitation and air temperature
   provide the primary inputs used to derive simulated runoff at a grid
   resolution of 25 kin across the pan-Arctic. The pan-Arctic water balance
   model (P/WBM) includes a simple scheme for simulating daily changes in
   soil frozen and liquid water amounts, with the thaw-freeze model (TFM)
   driven by air temperature, modelled soil moisture content, and
   physiographic data. Climate time series (precipitation and air
   temperature) are from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction
   (NCEP) reanalysis project for the period 1980-2001.
   P/WBM-generated maximum summer active-layer thickness estimates differ
   from a set of observed data by an average of 12 cm at 27 sites in
   Alaska, with many of the differences within the variability (1sigma)
   seen in field samples. Simulated long-term annual runoffs are in the
   range 100 to 400 mm year(-1). The highest runoffs are found across
   northeastern Canada, southern Alaska, and Norway, and lower estimates
   are noted along the highest latitudes of the terrestrial Arctic in North
   America and Asia. Good agreement exists between simulated and observed
   long-term seasonal (winter, spring, summer-fall) runoff to the ten
   Arctic sea basins (r = 0.84). Model water budgets are most sensitive to
   changes in precipitation and air temperature, whereas less affect is
   noted when other model parameters are altered. Increasing daily
   precipitation by 25\% amplifies annual runoff by 50 to 80\% for the
   largest Arctic drainage basins. Ignoring soil ice by eliminating the TFM
   sub-model leads to runoffs that are 7 to 27\% lower than the control
   run. The results of these model sensitivity experiments, along with
   other uncertainties in both observed validation data and model inputs,
   emphasize the need to develop improved spatial data sets of key
   geophysical quantities (particularly climate time series) to estimate
   terrestrial Arctic hydrological budgets better. Copyright (C) 2003 John

Abstract = {{Due to the occurrence of ponding during the period of rice growth, the
   analyses of rainfall-runoff in paddy fields are different from those in
   general lands. The diffusive tank model has been successfully applied in
   rainfall-runoff simulations in paddy fields because it can well describe
   the features of the local water flow. In most of the applications of
   this model, although the determination of the related model parameters
   is important, detailed investigations on each individual parameter are
   definitely needed to improve the accuracy of the results.
   In the study, an improved procedure is proposed to determine certain
   variables involved in the diffusive tank model and the application is
   conducted in a field area in Taiwan. In the application, the roughness
   of the river channel was assessed according to the actual field
   conditions. Instead of using the observed water levels in each rainfall
   event, the notch width of the rectangular contracted weir per unit area
   was evaluated by direct field measurements to calibrate the discharge
   coefficient. Test results from the selected field in six rainfall events
   showed that the local average value of the notch width of the
   rectangular contracted weir per unit area was 1.025 m/ha. Compared to
   the results of field measurements, the relative errors of the
   predictions were within 3\% in all tests of rainfall events. In
   addition, for different types of catchment partitions, it was found that
   the corresponding weir discharge coefficients remained roughly
   unchanged. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In desert shrubland ecosystems water and nutrients are concentrated
   beneath shrub canopies in `resource islands'. Rain falling on to these
   islands reaches the ground as either stemflow or throughfall and then
   either infiltrates into the soil or runs off as overland flow. This
   study investigates the partitioning of rainwater between stemflow and
   throughfall in the first instance and between infiltration and runoff in
   the second.
   Two series of 40 rainfall simulation experiments were performed on 16
   creosotebush shrubs in the Jornada Basin, New Mexico. The first series
   of experiments was designed to measure the surface runoff and was
   performed with each shrub in its growth position. The second series was
   designed to measure stemflow reaching the shrub base and was conducted
   with the shrub suspended above the ground. The experimental data show
   that once equilibrium is achieved, 16\% of the rainfall intercepted by
   the canopy or 6.7\% of the rain falling inside the shrub area (i.e. the
   area inside the shrub's circumscribing ellipse) is funnelled to the
   shrub base as stemflow. This redistribution of the rainfall by stemflow
   is a function of the ratio of canopy area (i.e. the area covered by the
   shrub canopy) to collar area (i.e. a circular area centred on the shrub
   base), with stemflow rate being positively correlated and throughfall
   rate being negatively correlated with this ratio.
   The surface runoff rate expressed as a proportion of the rate at which
   rainwater arrives at a point (i.e. stemflow rate plus throughfall rate)
   is the runoff coefficient. A multiple regression reveals that 75\% of
   the variance in the runoff coefficient can be explained by three
   independent variables: the rainfall rate, the ratio of the canopy area
   to the collar area, and the presence or absence of subcanopy vegetation.
   Although the last variable is a dummy variable, it accounts for 66.4\%
   of the variance in the runoff coefficient. This suggests that the
   density and extent of the subcanopy vegetation is the single most
   important control of the partitioning of rainwater between runoff and
   infiltration beneath creosotebush. Although these findings pertain to
   creosotebush, similar findings might be expected for other desert shrubs
   that generate significant stemflow and have subcanopy vegetation.

Abstract = {{The estimation of the spatial distribution of soil wetness within a
   catchment is one of the most important issues in hydrological and
   erosion modelling. So far, such models have been based on soil surface
   topographic information only. However, soil hydrology is also controlled
   by subsurface flow pathways that may not be explained only by surface
   terrain features. This study examined how the topography of the lower
   limit of the soil cover could improve quantitative modelling for the
   spatial prediction of soil wetness. The study was conducted in an
   agricultural catchment of the Armorican Massif (western France)
   characterized by impermeable granitic saprolites. Two digital elevation
   models (DEMs) with a 10-m grid mesh and with a 0.3 m vertical resolution
   were generated from field investigations throughout the catchment. One
   DEM was a numerical representation of the soil surface and the other
   described the topography of the boundary between the soil cover and the
   underlying impermeable saprolite. Soil wetness (theta) was surveyed
   systematically from 1996 to 1997 along a hillslope. The sampling scheme
   consisted of 149 nodes of a 10-m grid where theta at 0-10 cm was
   estimated using time-domain reflectometry. The value of theta at depths
   of 20-30, 50-60 and 110-120 cm was estimated for a subset of 112 data
   points using a gravimetric method. For both surface and subsurface DEMs,
   soil wetness at all depths significantly correlated with the topographic
   attributes, namely the distance to the stream bank, the elevation above
   the stream bank (E), the downslope gradient, the revised compound
   topographic index (CTI), and the specific monodirectional and
   multidirectional catchment areas. The best correlations were observed
   between theta(10) of winter 1996 and the physically based attributes E
   and CTI estimated by using the subsurface DEM (r = 0.83 and 0.86,
   respectively). Two multiple non-linear regression models for theta(10)
   spatial prediction were generated using non-autocorrelated topographic
   attributes estimated from both surface and subsurface topography. Model
   validation using a new set of 41 data points showed root mean square
   errors (RMSE) lower than 10\% of the theta(10) range. The model based on
   subsurface topography decreased RMSE by 43\%. Prediction errors were not
   spatially distributed. Finally, theses results are discussed in respect
   of processes involved in hillslope hydrology. Copyright (C) 2003 John

Abstract = {{Appropriate spatial scales of dominant variables are determined and
   integrated into an appropriate model scale. This is done in the context
   of the impact of climate change on flooding in the River Meuse in
   Western Europe. The objective is achieved by using observed elevation,
   soil type, land use type and daily precipitation data from several
   sources and employing different relationships between scales, variable
   statistics and outputs. The appropriate spatial scale of a key variable
   is assumed to be equal to a fraction of the spatial correlation length
   of that variable. This fraction was determined on the basis of
   relationships between statistics and scale and an accepted error in the
   estimation of the statistic of 10\%. This procedure resulted in an
   appropriate spatial scale for precipitation of about 20 km in an earlier
   study. The application to river basin variables revealed appropriate
   spatial scales for elevation, soil and land use of respectively 0.1, 5.3
   and 3.3 km. The appropriate model scale is determined by multiplying the
   appropriate variable scales with their associated weights. The weights
   are based on SCS curve number method relationships between the peak
   discharge and some specific parameters like slope and curve number. The
   values of these parameters are dependent on the scale of each key
   variable. The resulting appropriate model scale is about 10 km, implying
   225-250 model cells in an appropriate model of the Meuse basin meant to
   assess the impact of climate change on river flooding. The usefulness of
   the appropriateness procedure is in its ability to assess the
   appropriate scales of the individual key variables before model
   construction and integrate them in a balanced way into an appropriate
   model scale. Another use of the procedure is that it provides a
   framework for decisions about the reduction or expansion of data
   networks and needs. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Afforestation has been suggested as a means of improving soil and water
   conservation in north-western China, especially on the Loess Plateau.
   Understanding of the hydrological responses to afforestation will help
   us develop sustainable watershed management strategies. A study was
   conducted during the period of 1956 to 1980 to evaluate runoff responses
   to afforestation in a watershed on the Loess Plateau with an area of
   1.15 km(2), using a paired watershed approach. Deciduous trees,
   including locust (locusta L.), apricot (praecox L.) and elm (ulmus L.),
   were planted on about 80\% of a treated watershed, while a natural
   grassland watershed remained unchanged. It was estimated that cumulative
   runoff yield in the treated watershed was reduced by 32\% as a result of
   afforestation. A significant trend was also observed that shows annual
   runoff reduction increases with the age of the trees planted. Reduction
   in monthly runoff occurred mainly from June to September, which was
   ascribed to greater rainfall and utilization by trees during this
   period. Afforestation also resulted in reduction in the volume and peak
   flow of storm runoff events in the treated watershed with greater
   reduction in peak flow. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The UK Meteorological Office Surface Exchange Scheme (MOSES), which is
   currently implemented within Version 3 of the Hadley Centre GCM, was
   tested for an arctic peatland site in northern Finland (Kevo). This
   implementation of MOSES incorporated a new depth-dependent
   parameterization of the thermal and hydraulic properties of peat with
   parameter values derived from measurements reported in the literature.
   The effect of increasing the number of model soil layers from four to 13
   shallower layers was also investigated. Driving data were used that were
   collected during June, when the peat was still frozen below about 80 mm,
   to September 1997.
   Best model performance was given by the 13-layer, depth-dependent
   parameter description for both surface heat fluxes and soil
   temperatures. The simulated heat fluxes compared well with measurements,
   but simulated surface temperatures were too high. In preliminary runs
   the simulated distribution of unfrozen water in the soil was also
   unrealistic. In particular the model was unable to predict the rapid
   transition to above-freezing conditions that occurred throughout the
   soil profile about the second week in July. Adjusting a parameter (k) of
   the soil-freezing curve, which for peat can be used as a fitting
   parameter, produced a big improvement in the soil temperature profiles.
   A more accurate simulation of the freezing and thawing behaviour of
   organic soils requires that the processes that are hidden in the
   modified value of k are explicitly represented. Copyright (C) 2003 John

Abstract = {{Fourteen popular, representative infiltration models, some physically
   based, some semi-empirical and some empirical, were selected for a
   comparative evaluation. Using the Nash and Sutcliffe efficiency
   criterion, the models were evaluated and compared for 243 sets of
   infiltration data collected from field and laboratory tests conducted in
   India and the USA on soils ranging from coarse sand to fine clay. Based
   on a relative grading scale, the semi-empirical Singh-Yu general model,
   Holtan model and Horton model were graded respectively as 6.52, 5.57 and
   5.48 out of 10. The empirical Huggins and Monke model, modified
   Kostiakov and Kostiakov model were graded as 5.57, 5.30 and 5.22,
   respectively. The physically based non-linear and linear models of
   Smith-Parlange were graded as 5.48 and 5.22, respectively. Other models
   were ranked lower than these models. All the models generally performed
   poorly in field tests on Georgia's sandy soils, except the Robertsdale
   loamy sand. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new index is proposed for the selection of the best
   regional frequency analysis method. First, based on the theory of
   reliability, the new selective index is developed. The variances of
   three regional T-year event estimators are then derived. The proposed
   methodology is applied to an actual watershed. For each regional method,
   the reliability of various T-year regional estimates is computed.
   Finally, the reliability-based selective index graph is constructed from
   which the best regional method can be determined. In addition, the
   selection result is compared with that based on the traditional index,
   root mean square error. The proposed new index is recommended as an
   alternative to the existing indices such as root mean square error,
   because the influence of uncertainty and the accuracy of estimates are
   considered. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The relative significance of primary and secondary suspended sediment
   sources has been identified in a small (15 km(2)) agricultural catchment
   through the application of a linear unmixing model using mineral
   magnetic, geochemical and radionuclide signatures of fine sediments.
   Roads appear to be important as a secondary source of suspended sediment
   and in the conveyance of topsoils to the river channel. Roads also alter
   the source signatures of sediment in transport, especially that derived
   from agricultural topsoils. Modelling Suggests that c. 30\% of the
   suspended sediment collected from suspended sediment traps in the River
   Leadon were derived from, or transported via, roads. Relative
   contributions from primary sources of c. 43\% and c. 27\% were estimated
   from a combined (subsoil and channel bank) subsurface source, and a
   combined (arable and grassland) topsoil source, respectively. Copyright

Abstract = {{In this paper the groundwater quality of the southern part of Korinthos
   region (north-east Peloponnese) is discussed. The geology is
   characterized by a thick sequence of Neogene marls alternating with
   sandstones, overlain by superficial Quaternary deposits. The latter
   consist of a mixture of loose materials such as conglomerates, marly
   sandstones, sands and clay to silty sands. The area is crossed by a
   fault system parallel to the coastline, and the Quaternary sediments
   have formed extended Tyrrhenian marine terraces. Two aquifers have been
   identified in the area. The first is unconfined and occurs within the
   Quaternary sediments whereas the other is a deep confined aquifer
   occurring within the underlying Neogene marl series. Analysis of
   hydrochemical evolution over the past 30 years has indicated significant
   deterioration of quality owing to seawater intrusion and nitrate
   pollution. The various sources of pollution have rendered, to a large
   extent, shallow groundwater unsuitable not only for potable water supply
   but also for irrigation purposes. However, this is not the case for the
   deeper confined aquifer. Statistical analysis was used to explore the
   evolution of salinization during the years 1968 and 1998. In view of the
   alarming conditions caused by the documented groundwater quality
   deterioration, the need for integrated water resources management is
   stressed to maintain the socio-economic growth of the region studied.

Abstract = {{Due to the geological time scales required for observation of catchment
   evolution, surrogates or analogues of field data are necessary to
   understand long-term processes. To investigate long-term catchment
   behaviour, two experimental model catchments that developed without
   rigid boundaries under controlled conditions are examined and a
   qualitative and quantitative analysis of their evolution is presented.
   Qualitatively, the experimental catchments have the visual appearance of
   field scale data. Observation demonstrates that changes in catchment
   shape and network form are conservative. Quantitative analysis suggests
   that the catchments reach an equilibrium form while a reduction in the
   channel network occurs. While the catchments are laboratory scale
   models, the results provide insights into field scale behaviour.

   Sanshui hydrographic gauge stations, located at the lower reaches of the
   two main tributaries of the Zhujiang River, i.e. the Xijiang and the
   Beijing Rivers respectively. Organic carbon and nitrogen were also
   analysed using a conventional element analyser. The results demonstrate
   that the chemical composition of the riverine suspended sediment show
   obvious variability in different hydrological phases, which closely
   correlate to the organic matter content in suspended sediment.
   Intensified erosion in the flood phase results in lower concentration of
   the organic matter than that in the lower water level phase. The
   riverine suspended sediment with rich organic matter in the lower water
   level phase adsorbs some metal elements from the river water. Copyright

Abstract = {{For 2 years, water flow-patterns in the Garonne floodplain of
   south-westem France were studied in the field and through hydrodynamic
   modelling (MARTHE Hydrodynamic Software developed by BRGM). Water
   flow-paths and the transport of dissolved elements between river and
   aquifer have been investigated and modelled. In order to quantify the
   buffer function of the alluvial floodplain, we focused our work on the
   effect of a major flood on the water flow-direction, and on nitrate
   transport. Thus, we showed that the effect of a large flood in the river
   was rapidly lost with increasing distance from the river. During the
   observation period, a hydrologically active strip only 300 m wide on
   either side of the riverbed played a buffering role in absorbing the
   flood crest. It was also found that meanders favour the exchange between
   river and alluvial aquifer, shown by the creation of bypasses between
   the upstream and downstream parts of meanders. This, in turn,
   contributes to a dilution of nitrates in the phreatic aquifer, which
   here has higher nitrate content than the surface water; such dilution
   may result in an overestimation of the denitrification process in the
   wooded riverbanks. The coupling of chemical measurements-especially of
   chlorides and nitrate-with modelling of the dissolved-element transport
   allows us to establish the water balance for the riparian wetland, and
   to separate the effect of dilution and denitrification on nitrate
   concentration. This indicated the existence of areas in the riparian
   wetlands where denitrification is particularly strong, leading to
   reductions in nitrate concentrations of 10 to 30 mg/l NO3- during the
   flood. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In-lake retention of inorganic nitrogen species (nitrate and ammonium)
   was estimated from mass balances in five acid-sensitive lakes in
   southern Norway and eight in southern Ontario, Canada, to evaluate an
   empirical in-lake N retention (R-N) model. This model is included in the
   First-order Acidity Balance (FAB) model, which currently is used for
   calculation of critical acid loads and exceedances in many countries. To
   estimate in-lake RN, the FAB model uses a recommended mass transfer
   coefficient (S-N) of 5 m year(-1), which mainly is derived from NO3-
   mass balances in Canadian lakes. To date, the in-lake RN model has not
   been evaluated for large parts of Europe. At the Norwegian study sites
   receiving the highest N deposition (>120 meq m(-2) year(-1)) the net
   in-lake retention of inorganic N (TIN) exceeded the corresponding
   terrestrial retention by a factor of 1.1-2.6. Despite differences in N
   loading and hydrology at the Norwegian and Canadian sites, both the mean
   mass transfer coefficients for NO3- (SNO3; 6.5 versus 5.6 m year(-1))
   and TIN (S-TIN ; 7.9 versus 7.0 m year(-1)) were of comparable
   magnitude. Both mean values and ranges of SNO3 suggest that the default
   SN value presently recommended for FAB model applications seems valid
   over a large range in N inputs and areal water loads (q(s)). However,
   owing to the relatively few data available for lakes with high q(s)
   values (15-150 m year(-1)), it is recommended that more lakes within
   this range be included in future studies to obtain a more precise
   prediction of in-lake N retention over a wide q(s\textbackslash{})
   gradient. Also, when considering that the FAB model treats all inorganic
   N leaching from a catchment as NO3-, it seems reasonable to use a
   default STIN value instead of just SNO3 when estimating in-lake R-N. In
   that case, the in-lake R-N presently calculated by the FAB model might
   be slightly underestimated. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study of water fluxes from roofs in a residential area
   has quantified water fluxes from different types of roof and identified
   the major controls on the process. Roofs with pitches of 0degrees,
   22degrees and 50degrees and orientations of 15degrees (from true north)
   (NNE) and 103degrees (ESE) were selected. A novel automatic system for
   monitoring has been developed. Noticeable differences in rainfall,
   runoff and evaporation were found for different roof slopes, aspects and
   heights. Depending on height, flat roofs collected 90 to 99\% of
   rainfall recorded at ground level. Roofs with a 22degrees slope; facing
   south-south-west (i.e. facing the prevailing wind) captured most rain,
   whereas east-south-east facing roofs with slopes of 50degrees received
   the least. Depending on the roof slope, the average rainfall captured
   ranged from 62 to 93\% of that at ground level. For the same slope, the
   results indicated that from roofs orientated normal to the prevailing
   wind; (i) captured rainfall was higher, (ii) evaporation was higher and
   (iii) runoff was less than that from roofs having other aspects. Monthly
   variations in the runoff-rainfall ratio followed the rainfall
   distribution, being lowest in summer and highest in winter. The highest
   mean ratio (0.91) was associated with the steeper roof slope; the lowest
   ratio (0.61) was for roofs facing the prevailing wind direction. For the
   same amount of rainfall, the runoff generated from a steeper roof was
   significantly higher than that generated by a moderate roof slope, but
   the lowest runoff was from roofs facing the prevailing wind. The results
   have also shown that the amount of runoff collected (under UK climatic
   condition) was sufficient to supply an average household in the studied
   area with the major part of its annual water requirements. The use of
   this water not only represents a financial gain for house owners but
   also will help protect the environment by reducing demand on water
   resources through the reduction of groundwater abstraction, construction
   of new reservoirs, and a reduction of the flood risk as its in situ use
   is considered a preventive measure known as a source control. Copyright

Abstract = {{Lack of accurate data has led some hydrologists and city planners to
   assume that urban infiltration is zero and runoff is 100\% of the
   rainfall. These assumptions lead to an over estimation of road runoff
   volume and an underestimation of direct recharge to groundwater, which
   is already rising under some UK cities. This study investigates in
   filtration and runoff processes and quantifies the percentage of
   rainfall that contributes to storm drainage, and that which infiltrates
   through different types of road surface. Access tubes were installed for
   measuring soil water content using a neutron probe in three car parks, a
   road and a grass site at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Crowmarsh
   Gifford, Wallingford. Storm drainage was recorded at the exit of the
   Thamesmead Estate in Crowmarsh Gifford, just before the drain joins the
   River Thames at Wallingford. Rainfall and water table depth were also
   recorded. Weekly measurements of soil moisture content indicated that
   the top 40 cm layer is not influenced by water-table fluctuations and,
   therefore, positive changes in soil moisture could be attributed to
   infiltration of rainfall through the surface. Depending on the nature of
   the surface, subsurface layers, level of traffic, etc., between 6 and
   9\% of rainfall was found to infiltrate through the road surfaces
   studied. The storm drainage generated by road runoff revealed a flow
   pattern similar to that of the receiving watercourse (River Thames) and
   increased with the increase of infiltration and soil water content below
   the road surface. The ratio of runoff to rainfall was 0.7, 0.9 and 0.5
   for annual, winter (October-March) and summer (April-September)
   respectively. As the results of the infiltration indicated that 6 to 9\%
   of annual rainfall infiltrates through the road surface, this means that
   evaporation represents, 21-24\% of annual rainfall, with more
   evaporation taking place during summer than winter. Copyright (C) 2003

Abstract = {{As part of an effort to demonstrate the use of climate predictions for
   water resources management, the El Nio (n) over tilde /Southem
   Oscillation (ENSO) influences on stream flow in the Kelani River in Sri
   Lanka were investigated using correlation analysis, composite analysis
   and contingency tables. El Ni (n) over tildeo (warm phase of ENSO) was
   associated with decreased annual stream flow and La Ni (n) over tildea
   (cold phase of ENSO) with increased annual flows. The annual stream flow
   had a negative correlation with the simultaneous ENSO index of NINO3.4
   that was significant at the 95\% level. This negative correlation is
   enhanced to a 99\% level if the aggregate January to September or the
   April to September stream flow alone were considered. Although, there is
   little correlation between ENSO indices and stream flow during the
   October to December period, there is a high correlation between rainfall
   and NINO3.4 (r = 0.51, significant at the 99\% level). Therefore ENSO
   based rainfall predictions can be used along with a hydrological model
   to predict the October to December stream flow. This study demonstrates
   the viability of using ENSO based predictors for January to September or
   April to September stream flow predictions in the Kelani River. The
   October to December stream flow may be predicted by exploiting the
   strong relationship between ENSO and rainfall during that period.

   twice, once with the underlying trends constrained to be identical for
   each river and once with the trends unconstrained. Statistical
   properties are assessed by simulation methods that allow for the

Abstract = {{In the Lainbach catchment, unconsolidated Pleistocene moraine sediments
   are widely distributed. Because of the great natural risk of floods,
   together with extreme loads of sediments, investigations of runoff
   production processes have been conducted in this area. At hillslope
   scale three test sites with different states of soil development and
   vegetation cover were instrumented with V-shaped weirs, precipitation
   gauges and measurement devices for electrical conductivity (EC) of
   discharge water. The EC has been used as a geochemical tracer for
   hydrograph separation, since the statistical relationship between
   content of dissolved Ca2+, Mg2+ cations and EC is highly significant for
   different stages of runoff. This method allows hydrograph separation at
   high temporal resolution for both the rising and falling limb of the
   hydrograph. The following results of the investigations can be resumed.
   If relief conditions are similar, the effectiveness of runoff production
   decreases with an increasing density of vegetation cover. The runoff
   delivery ratio decreases as well as the peaks of runoff. In contrast,
   concentration times of hillslope catchments are equal, even if
   vegetation cover is of great density and soils are well developed. As a
   reason for the short reaction times, different runoff production
   processes have been detected. On bare ground, infiltration excess
   overland flow intensified by surface sealing processes is the main
   source for quick runoff. On hillslopes well covered by vegetation,
   translatory flow processes indicated by soil water with high solute
   contents force a rapid runoff reaction only a few minutes after rainfall
   has begun. It is to be assumed that translatory flow is a runoff
   production process typical for hillslopes covered by vegetation in a
   steep alpine relief. By means of the areal distribution of the
   topographic index, concentration of runoff production on a small part of
   the catchment has been demonstrated for hillslopes densely covered by
   vegetation. The investigations have shown that there is a lack of
   studies on runoff production processes in steep alpine relief, as well
   as a deficit of methods to quantify hydraulic properties of
   coarse-grained soils with a wide grain size distribution. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this study was to examine the hydrogeochemical
   factors leading to nitrate contamination of shallow groundwater in an
   agricultural area. Another purpose was to identify relationships between
   variations in organic matter levels (as estimated by the BOD and COD
   parameters) of groundwater that transports effluent from small-scale
   livestock holdings. Major cations, anions, BOD and COD of organic matter
   and total coliforms were analysed. It was found that groundwaters
   beneath cultivated areas and areas carrying livestock had higher
   concentrations of calcium, nitrate and chloride than did freshwater.
   Above all, the nitrification process increased concentrations of
   nitrate. Nitrate levels were depressed in some places where the
   groundwater was low in dissolved oxygen. Groundwaters affected by
   livestock activities showed high concentrations of organic matter (BOD,
   COD) and high microbial concentrations (as indicated by total
   coliforms). The COD/BOD ratio increased in the downward direction. It
   was inferred that this was due to the faster loss of easily
   biodegradable organic matter compared with non-biodegradable organic
   matter proceeding away from a discharge. Accordingly, it is possible to
   trace effluent in a small area back to a point source by monitoring the
   COD/BOD ratio of groundwater. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{When estimating the dry-canopy evaporation rate of coniferous stands
   using the Penman-Monteith equation, it is crucial to determine the
   reference value of surface conductance G,. This paper examines the
   relationship between canopy height and the reference value of G, based
   on the maximum value of G(s) with a vapour pressure deficit greater than
   or equal to 1.0 kPa, (G) over cap (S) (max).There is a clear correlation
   between canopy height and (G) over cap (S) (max) when the projected leaf
   area index greater than or equal to 3.0. This suggests that using this
   relationship will enable more accurate determination of the reference
   value of G(s) for closed stands. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{This paper presents an overview of the `downward approach' to hydrologic
   prediction and attempts to provide a context for the papers appearing in
   this special issue. The downward approach is seen as a necessary
   counterpoint to the mechanistic `reductionist' approach that dominates
   current hydrological model development. It provides a systematic
   framework to learning from data, including the testing of hypotheses at
   every step of analysis. It can also be applied in a hierarchical manner:
   starting from exploring first-order controls in the modelling of
   catchment response, the model complexity can then be increased in
   response to deficiencies in reproducing observations at different
   levels. The remaining contributions of this special issue present a
   number of applications of the downward approach, including development
   of parsimonious water balance models with changing time scales by
   learning from signatures extracted from observed streamflow data at
   different time scales, regionalization of model parameters,
   parameterization of effects of sub-grid variability, and standardized
   statistical approaches to analyse data and to develop model structures.
   This review demonstrates that the downward approach is not a rigid
   methodology, but represents a generic framework. It needs to play an
   increasing role in the future in the development of hydrological models
   at the catchment scale. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Discharge hydrographs of rivers carry the cumulated information on the
   various hydrological processes in catchments and the influences imposed
   on them. From the analysis of observed baseflow recessions, direct and
   groundwater flow can be separated and time series of the main components
   of the underlying groundwater balance, namely discharge,
   evapotranspiration losses, abstractions, storage and recharge, can be
   derived. This inverse, or downward, approach was applied to daily
   streamflow data of rivers in different climate zones (Germany, Western
   Australia, Turkey) under different influences. The mostly shallow,
   unconfined aquifers were found to react as nonlinear reservoirs and an
   appropriate recession function was used instead of the traditional
   exponential function of the linear reservoir. However, though the actual
   storage-discharge relationships of aquifers will hardly change, flow
   recession properties are subject to seasonal variation and changes due
   to evapotranspiration and other fluxes and abstractions from the
   groundwater. As demonstrated in the case studies, recession analysis and
   baseflow separation permits the detection and quantification of these
   changes. In a separate application, the method is used to identify
   groundwater flow intruded into leaky sewer lines. Copyright (C) 2003

Abstract = {{This paper is addressed towards the problem of extracting appropriate
   model structures by systematic analysis of rainfall-runoff relationships
   in gauged catchments. The Upper Enns catchment in the Austrian Alps is
   selected as the basis of this study. The downward approach championed by
   Klemes is followed, which involves stepwise adjustment of model
   structure to capture the observed streamflow variability progressively
   at the annual, monthly, and then on to daily time scales. Throughout, we
   focus on emergent properties of the hydrological system at the various
   time scales, as detected in key signature plots and hydrographs, and
   model complexity is always kept to the minimum required. Any further
   alteration or calibration of parameter values is avoided, either with
   change of scales or in response to inadequate predictions. The downward
   approach presented leads to parsimonious water balance models with
   excellent performance and the minimum set of parameters, with a good
   balance being achieved between model performance and complexity.

Abstract = {{A 2600 m(3) free-draining lysimeter constructed in a Pinus sylvestris
   plantation forest in Colbitz, Germany, has been monitored daily since
   1974, with the intent of improving the understanding the effect of
   afforestation upon groundwater recharge (drainage). The objective of
   this research was to employ a downward approach in the development of a
   conceptual water balance model applicable to the site. Observed annual
   and inter-annual trends were successfully replicated by a simple
   capacitance model using a simplified representation of vegetation
   growth. An important limitation of the capacitance approach in
   simulating the timing of drainage at sub-annual time scales was
   identified, which could not be overcome by adding complexity to the
   model basis. Given the a priori use of capacitance approaches for
   simulating drainage in many hydrological models, the findings of this
   study suggest that (a) these approaches are sufficient where the
   prediction of annual and inter-annual drainage behaviour is the primary
   objective, and that (b) an alternative basis accounting for the time
   delay between precipitation inputs and drainage generation is required
   for modelling if the prediction of drainage at sub-annual time scales is
   a priority. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We present a systematic approach to achieving accurate hourly streamflow
   predictions at locations internal to a catchment, potentially with
   minimal calibration. Each step in this approach is meant to provide
   insight into the relative importance of catchment and climatic
   properties (rainfall, soil, vegetation, topography), their spatial
   variability, and their influence on the spatial and temporal variability
   of streamflows. This has been made possible through the use of a simple
   conceptual model design requiring minimal calibration and with
   physically meaningful catchment parameters estimated mostly a priori
   from landscape data, and climatic variables. Eight model types
   originating from this simple conceptual model design, with complexity
   ranging from lumped to fully distributed, were tested over summer and
   winter periods at the Mahurangi Catchment, New Zealand, and the
   preferred model identified using statistical assessment criteria.
   Results of the simulations suggest that, although the required model
   complexity was found to be a function of the season (summer versus
   winter), a fully distributed representation is most appropriate for
   accurate predictions under all seasonal climate conditions. Using this
   model, the success of hourly flow predictions in space-time was assessed
   and sensitivity analysis used to identify the dominant controls on the
   timing and magnitude of hourly flow predictions and to investigate the
   adequacy of the assumption of homogeneity for a number of catchment
   properties. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Regionalization approaches to daily streamflow prediction are
   investigated for 13 catchments in the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory
   using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model of low complexity (six
   parameters). Model parameters are considered to represent the dynamic
   response characteristics (DRCs) of a catchment. It is demonstrated that
   all catchments within the region cannot be assumed to have a similar
   hydrological behaviour, and thence a regionalization approach
   considering differences in physical catchment descriptors (PCDs) is
   required. Such a regionalization approach can be regarded as a top-down
   method, in the sense that factors controlling parameter variability are
   identified first within the entire region under study, and then such
   information is exploited to predict runoff in a smaller sub-region.
   Regionalization results reveal that consideration of interrelations
   between dependent variables, which here are the parameters of the
   rainfall-runoff model, can improve performance of regression as a
   regionalization method. Breaking the parameter correlation structure
   inherent in the model, and exploiting merely relationships between model
   parameters and PCDs (no matter how weakly related they are), can result
   in a significant decrease in regionalization performance. Also, high
   significance of regression between values of PCDs and DRCs does not
   guarantee a set of parameters with a good predictive power. When there
   is a reason to believe that, in the sense of hydrological behaviour, a
   gauged catchment resembles the ungauged catchment, then it may be
   worthwhile to adopt the entire set of calibrated parameters from the
   gauged catchment instead of deriving quantitative relationships between
   catchment descriptors and model parameters. Copyright (C) 2003 John

Abstract = {{An intensive field monitoring programme was conducted in 1998 and 1999
   in an 84 ha catchment located on the North Island of New Zealand. The
   data collected includes six soil moisture patterns, 12 soil moisture
   time-series, flow at the outlets of two subcatchments of 56 ha and 28
   ha, rainfall and other meteorological data. This data set was used in a
   downward approach to constrain the conceptualisations and the parameters
   of a terrain-based distributed model, aiming to simulate the spatial and
   temporal variability of the soil moisture and the flow response observed
   in the two subcatchments. The principal mechanism producing runoff was
   assessed by a preliminary data analysis, involving rainfall, flow and
   soil moisture time-series as well as the simulation of infiltration
   processes at the point scale. Runoff was identified as being mainly
   produced by saturation excess across the entire monitoring period,
   despite the high intensity rainfall observed in that area. The model
   soil-water-retention parameters were determined from the soil moisture
   patterns. The other soil parameters controlling the soil transmissivity
   were determined by calibration against the observed flow in 1999 in the
   56 ha subcatchment, accumulated at the daily scale. The analysis of the
   flow data at the hourly scale illustrated the need for a more complex
   subsurface transmissivity function in order to produce lateral storm
   flow with a larger range of celerity. A simple solution was to modify
   the decay of the lateral transmissivity with the soil moisture content
   by adding a second component activated only for soil moisture close to
   saturation. The additional parameters were calibrated against the
   observed hourly flow in 1999 in the 56 ha subcatchment. The remaining
   data were used for validation purposes. This data-driven, downward
   approach to identifying the model conceptualisation and parameters
   resulted in a model capable of reproducing the observed catchment
   behaviour while minimising model complexity. Copyright (C) 2003 John

Abstract = {{The current tendency in `physically based' soil-vegetation-atmosphere
   transfer (SVAT) schemes is to use increasingly complex process
   descriptions to predict evaporative fluxes at both patch and landscape
   scales. This approach does not take proper account of the
   heterogeneities that are evident in any landscape. A top-down approach
   to sub-grid-scale land surface parameterization would suggest that the
   current complexity may not be supported by the calibration data
   available. By comparing three SVAT schemes of differing complexity
   within the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation framework, we
   demonstrate the utility of simpler rather than more complex models when
   calibrated against flux data from various intensive field campaigns. A
   more robust calibration is achieved for a simple evaporative fraction
   approach allowing the feasible parameter ranges to be more strongly
   conditioned by the available data. It is argued that a top-down
   (dominant mode) predictive model based on a database of such robustly
   estimated parameter values would result in no greater uncertainty at the
   scales of application than trying to form parameter sets for complex
   models from a variety of sources. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{Simple models of groundwater flow have limited capability of
   representing spatial waterlogging/salinization due to the mismatch in
   scale between model cell size/process conceptualization and actual
   process scale. This paper presents a method for utilizing increasingly
   available high-resolution digital elevation data to develop a sub-grid
   parameterization for groundwater discharge and surface waterlogging.
   This enables simple groundwater models to represent the actual area of
   waterlogging/salinization better. The approach utilizes a
   `zero-piezometric surface' (i.e. a planar surface that passes through
   the lowest point of each element in a groundwater model). The difference
   in elevation between the zero-piezometric surface and a high-resolution
   digital elevation model (DEM) provides a distribution of depth to the
   zero-piezometric surface (at the DEM scale) for each element in the
   model. Traditional methods for evaluating surface discharge can then be
   applied at the DEM cell scale to the distribution of depth to
   zero-piezometric surface to derive a relationship between depth to
   piezometric surface and net recharge/discharge, for each element in the
   model. A simple one dimensional groundwater flow model, FLOWTUBE, is
   used to demonstrate the approach. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to assess the extent that information can
   be transferred between hydrogeologically similar catchments, by
   investigating in detail one set of similar catchments. In particular,
   five examples of a class of deeply weathered, fractured rock aquifers
   were used as the basis for this assessment. This catchment type was
   chosen because of its prominence in salinized regions in southeastern
   Australia. The catchments chosen encompass a wide variety of scales.
   gradients, and climatic zones. The five catchments were modelled using
   FLOWTUBE. Catchment parameter values, catchment response to incremental
   reductions in recharge and the similarity of the catchments were
   compared. The results suggest that there is a considerable range in
   parameter values, but that this is smaller than the range for all
   aquifer types. However, given the sensitivity of the models to
   transmissivity and specific yield, the range of values was too high to
   allow the transfer of `averaged' values to other hydrogeologically
   similar catchments with confidence. Evaluation of a dimensionless
   similarity parameter G for each of the five catchments indicates that
   the parameters of transmissivity, specific yield, length and head may be
   interrelated. The implications of this are: (1) that the range in
   catchment responses might not be as great as suggested by standard
   sensitivity studies; (2) surrogate parameters may exist, which would
   enable aquifer parameters to be transferred to other hydrogeologically
   similar catchments with greater confidence. Copyright (C) 2003 John

   hillslope erosion channel networks. Eight erosion channel networks were
   studied on mine spoil sites in Kemmerer, Wyoming. We analysed these
   networks using well-known geomorphological relationships such as
   Horton's laws and Melton's law. An analysis of the erosion channel
   hydraulic geometry described by a series of power functions was also
   conducted. We found that the network geometry resembles larger river

   channels exhibit statistical characteristics of their larger river

Abstract = {{Annual rainfall records from the island of Crete in Greece were used
   with the aid of a geographical information system (GIS) to study the
   temporal and spatial rainfall characteristics. The GIS was used to
   produce a digital elevation model, delineate watersheds and estimate the
   areal rainfall from a network of raingauges by using different
   interpolation schemes. The rainfall-elevation correlation was
   significant, suggesting an orographic type of precipitation for the
   island. The rainfall records for the majority of the stations were found
   to fit the normal distribution. Deviation from normal for the rest of
   the records was attributed to the wettest year of 1977-1978. The year
   1989-1990 was the driest, and most rainfall records showed a decrease in
   rainfall over 30 years with higher negative rainfall gradients at the
   higher elevations. Frequency analysis of the rainfall records was used
   to estimate areal rainfall for the island of Crete and its main
   watersheds for return periods of 2, 5 and 10 years. Copyright (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Water quality data collected on a fortnightly or monthly basis are
   inadequate for assessment and modelling of many water quality problems
   as storm event samples are underrepresented or missed. This paper
   examines the stormflow dynamics of heavy metals (Pb, Cu, Cd and Zn) in
   the Nant-y-Fendrod stream, South Wales, which has been affected by 250
   years of metal smelting, followed by 35 years of landscape
   rehabilitation measures. For storm events of contrasting (very dry and
   very wet) antecedent conditions in May 2000 and February 2001,
   respectively, temporal changes in streamwater heavy metal concentrations
   above and below an in-line flood detention lake are analysed. At the
   upstream site, peaks in total metal concentration were recorded on the
   rising limb for Pb (0-150 mg l(-1)) and Cu (0-038 mg l(-1)) but on the
   falling limb for Zn (1-660 mg l(-1)) and Cd (0-006 mg l(-1)) in the
   summer 2000 storm event, yielding clockwise and anticlockwise hysteretic
   loops respectively. In contrast, metal concentrations, although high
   throughout the winter storm event, were diluted somewhat during the
   storm peak itself. The Pb and Cu appear to be supplied by quickflow
   processes and transported in close association with fine sediment,
   whereas Zn and Cd are delivered to the channel and lake by slower
   subsurface seepage in dissolved form. In the winter 2001 event,
   antecedent soil moisture and shallow groundwater levels were anomalously
   high and seepage sources of dissolved metals dominated. Downstream of
   the lake, Pb and Cu levels and suspended sediment were high in the
   summer storm, but low in the winter storm, suggesting retention with
   deposition of fine sediment in the lake during the latter. In the winter
   storm, Zn and Cd levels were higher downstream than upstream of the
   lake, perhaps because of additional seepage inputs from the surrounding
   slopes, which failed to have an impact during summer. An understanding
   of the complex interplay of antecedent soil moisture and the dynamics of
   subsurface seepage pathways in relation to the three-dimensional
   distribution of sources is important in modelling heavy metal fluxes and
   levels in contaminated urban catchments. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley

   effects of the hydrological cycle. We introduce the concept of renewal
   time to express the rate of water replacement in a specific reach of a

   used to estimate renewal times for several reaches in the middle and

   reveal the following trends: (i) renewal times are shortest during the
   May-October period and (ii) annual renewal times tend to decrease when

Abstract = {{Measurements of suspended particulate matter concentration and turbidity
   point towards the possibility of a site-specific algorithm (SPM),
   relating SPM to nephelometric turbidity units (NTU). In this paper
   regression models are presented that account for changes in the
   relationship of SPM and NTU as a result of changes in particle
   properties. The models have been developed by the use of daily
   measurements of SPM concentration and a continuous record of turbidity
   for the period from June 1996 to February 2001 in the River Elbe, a
   major river in the eastern part of Germany.
   The effect of changes in the particle properties with increasing water
   discharge was taken into account by varying the slope of a linear
   regression equation according to a logistic function. Water discharge,
   Q, was defined to be the only variable of this function-as an adequate
   substitute of the parameter bottom shear stress, which cannot be
   measured directly. Measurements of flow velocity in the River Elbe show
   that bottom shear stress is related almost linearly to water discharge
   up to bankful discharges.
   Regression models with slopes varying continuously with hydraulic
   parameters may account for the effects resulting from changes of
   particle characteristics and thus may have some advantages compared with
   models with a constant slope or models calibrated for different seasons.

Abstract = {{New methods for obtaining and quantifying spatially distributed
   subsurface moisture are a high research priority in process hydrology.
   We use simple linear regression analyses to compare terrain electrical
   conductivity measurements (EC) derived from multiple electromagnetic
   induction (EMI) frequencies to a distributed grid of water-table depth
   and soil-moisture measurements in a highly instrumented 50 by 50 m
   hillslope in Putnam County, New York. Two null hypotheses were tested:
   H0((1)), there is no relationship between water table depth and EC;
   H0((2)), there is no relationship between soil moisture levels and EC.
   We reject both these hypotheses. Regression analysis indicates that EC
   measurements from the low frequency EM31 meter with a vertical dipole
   orientation could explain over 80\% of the variation in water-table
   depth across the test hillslope. Despite zeroing and sensitivity
   problems encountered with the high frequency EM38, EC measurements could
   explain over 70\% of the gravimetrically determined soil-moisture
   variance. The use of simple moisture retrieval algorithms, which
   combined EC measurements from the EM31 and EM38 meters in both their
   vertical and horizontal orientations, helped increase the r(2)
   coefficients slightly. This first hillslope hydrological analysis of EMI
   technology in this way suggests that it may be a promising method for
   the collection of a large number of distributed soilwater and
   groundwater depth measurements with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

Abstract = {{Airborne scanning laser altimetry (LiDAR) is an important new data
   source that can provide two-dimensional river flood models with
   spatially distributed floodplain topography for model bathymetry,
   together with vegetation heights for parameterization of model friction.
   Methods are described for improving such models by decomposing the
   model's finite-element mesh to reflect floodplain vegetation features
   such as hedges and trees having different frictional properties to their
   surroundings, and significant floodplain topographic features having
   high height curvatures. The decomposition is achieved using an image
   segmentation system that converts the LiDAR height image into separate
   images of surface topography and vegetation height at each point. The
   vegetation height map is used to estimate a friction factor at each mesh
   node. The spatially distributed friction model has the advantage that it
   is physically based, and removes the need for a model calibration
   exercise in which free parameters specifying friction in the channel and
   floodplain are adjusted to achieve best fit between modelled and
   observed flood extents. The scheme was tested in a modelling study of a
   flood that occurred on the River Severn, UK, in 1998. A satellite
   synthetic aperture radar image of flood extent was used to validate the
   model predictions. The simulated hydraulics using the decomposed mesh
   gave a better representation of the observed flood extent than the more
   simplistic but computationally efficient approach of sampling topography
   and vegetation friction factors on to larger floodplain elements in an
   undecomposed mesh, as well as the traditional approach using no
   LiDAR-derived data but simply using a constant floodplain friction
   factor. Use of the decomposed mesh also allowed velocity variations to
   be predicted in the neighbourhood of vegetation features such as hedges.
   These variations could be of use in predicting localized erosion and
   deposition patterns that might result in the event of a flood. Copyright

Abstract = {{Fog precipitation occurs when fog droplets are filtered by the forest
   canopy and coalesce on the vegetative surfaces to form larger water
   droplets that drip to the forest floor. This study examines the quantity
   of throughfall compared with incident precipitation produced by the
   canopy of a lower montane rain forest (2100 m) and an upper montane
   cloud forest (2550 m) in the Sierra de las Minas Biosphere Reserve,
   Guatemala. Fog precipitation was measured with throughfall and
   precipitation gauges from 23 July 1995 to 7 June 1996. Fog precipitation
   occurred during sampling periods when throughfall exceeded incident
   precipitation. Fog precipitation contributed <1\% of total water inputs
   in the cloud forest at 2100 m during the 44-week period, whereas fog
   precipitation contributed 7.4\% at 2550 m during the same period. The
   depth equivalent of fog precipitation was greater at 2550 m (203.4 mm)
   than at 2100 m (23.4 mm). The calculation of fog precipitation in this
   study is underestimated. The degree of underestimation may be evident in
   the difference in apparent rainfall interception between 2100 m (35\%)
   and 2550 m (4\%). Because the apparent interception rate at 2550 m is
   significantly lower than 2100 m, the canopy probably is saturated for
   longer periods as a result of cloud water contributions. Data show a
   seasonal pattern of fog precipitation most evident at the 2550 m site.
   Fog precipitation represented a larger proportion of total water inputs
   during the dry season (November to May). Because cloud forests generate
   greater than I mm day(-1) of fog precipitation in higher elevations of
   the Sierra de las Minas, the conservation of the cloud forest may be
   important to meet the water demands of a growing population in the
   surrounding and lowlands. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Rapidly depleting unconfined aquifers are the primary source of water
   for irrigation on the North China Plain. Yet, despite its critical
   importance, groundwater recharge to the Plain remains an enigma. We
   introduce a one-dimensional soil-water-balance model to estimate
   precipitation- and irrigation-generated areal recharge from commonly
   available crop and soil characteristics and climate data. To limit input
   data needs and to simplify calculations, the model assumes that water
   flows vertically downward under a unit gradient; infiltration and
   evapotranspiration are separate, sequential processes;
   evapotranspiration is allocated to evaporation and transpiration as a
   function of leaf-area index and is limited by soil-moisture content; and
   evaporation and transpiration are distributed through the soil profile
   as exponential functions of soil and root depth, respectively. For
   calibration, model-calculated water contents of I I soil-depth intervals
   from 0 to 200 cm were compared with measured water contents of loam soil
   at four sites in Luancheng County, Hebei Province, over 3 years
   (1998-2001). Each 50-m(2) site was identically cropped with winter wheat
   and summer maize, but received a different irrigation treatment. Average
   root mean-squared error between measured and model-calculated water
   content of the top 180 cm was 4.2 cm, or 9.3\% of average total water
   content. In addition, model-calculated evapotranspiration compared well
   with that measured by a large-scale lysimeter. To test the model, 12
   additional sites were simulated successfully. Model results demonstrate
   that drainage from the soil profile is not a constant fraction of
   precipitation and irrigation inputs, but rather the fraction increases
   as the inputs increase. Because this drainage recharges the underlying
   aquifer, improving irrigation efficiency by reducing seepage will not
   reverse water-table declines. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A coupled deterministic hydrological and water temperature model,
   CEQUEAU, was modified to include soil temperature and crown closure in
   its calculation of local advective terms in the heat budget. The
   modified model was than tested to verify its sensitivity to these
   modifications. An analysis of the heat budget of a small forested
   catchment in eastern Canada revealed that the advective term related to
   interflow plays a significant role in the daily water heat budget,
   providing on average 28\% of the local advective budget (which also
   includes advective heat terms from surface runoff and groundwater) and
   nearly 14\% of the total heat budget (which includes all radiative terms
   at the water surface, convection and evaporation, as well as the local
   advective terms).
   Relative sensitivity indices (RSIs) were used to verify the impact of
   the newly introduced parameters and variables. Among them, parameters
   related to the forest cover (crown closure and leaf area index) have a
   maximum RSI of -0.6; i.e. a 100\% increase in value produces a 60\%
   decrease in the local advective term. Parameters with the greatest
   influence are the volume of water contributing to interflow and the
   amplitude of the net radiative flux at the soil surface, which, if
   doubled, would double the contribution of the local interflow advective
   term to the heat budget. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Contaminated sediments deposited within urban water bodies commonly
   exert a significant negative effect on overlying water quality. However,
   our understanding of the processes operating within such anthropogenic
   sediments is currently poor. This paper describes the nature of the
   sediment and early diagenetic reactions in a highly polluted major urban
   water body (the Salford Quays of the Manchester Ship Canal) that has
   undergone remediation focused on the water column.
   The style of sedimentation within Salford Quays has been significantly
   changed as a result of remediation of the water column. Pre-remediation
   sediments are composed of a range of natural detrital grains,
   predominantly quartz and clay, and anthropogenic detrital material
   dominated by industrial furnace-derived metal-rich slag grains.
   Post-remediation sediments are composed of predominantly autochthonous
   material, including siliceous algal remains and clays. At the top of the
   pre-remediation sediments and immediately beneath the post-remediation
   sediments is a layer significantly enriched in furnace-derived slag
   grains, input into the basin as a result of site clearance prior to
   water-column remediation. These grains contain a high level of metals,
   resulting in a significantly enhanced metal concentration in the
   sediments at this depth.
   Porewater analysis reveals the importance of both bacterial organic
   matter oxidation reactions and the dissolution of industrial grains upon
   the mobility of nutrient and chemical species within Salford Quays.
   Minor release of iron and manganese at shallow depths is likely to be
   taking place as a result of bacterial Fe(III) and Mn(IV) reduction.
   Petrographic analysis reveals that the abundant authigenic mineral
   within the sediment is manganese-rich vivianite, and thus Fe(II) and
   Mn(II) released by bacterial reactions may be being taken up through the
   precipitation of this mineral. Significant porewater peaks in iron,
   manganese and silicon deeper in the sediment column are most probably
   the result of dissolution of furnace-derived grains in the sediments.
   These species have subsequently diffused into porewater above and below
   the metal-enriched layer.
   This study illustrates that the remediation of water quality in
   anthropogenic water bodies can significantly impact upon the physical
   and chemical nature of sedimentation. Additionally, it also highlights
   how diagenetic processes in sediments derived from anthropogenic grains
   can be markedly different from those in sediments derived from natural
   detrital material. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study uses 2 years of data from a detailed weekly water sampling
   programme in a 11.4 km(2) upland peat catchment in the Northern
   Pennines, UK. The sampling comprised precipitation, soil-water samples
   and a number of streams, including the basin outlet. Samples were
   analysed for: pH, conductivity, alkalinity, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, Total
   N, SO4, Cl and colour. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to
   identify end-members and compositional trends in order to identify
   controls on the development of water composition. The study showed that
   the direct use of PCA had several advantages over the use of end-member
   mixing analysis (EMMA) as it combines an analysis of mixing and evolving
   waters without the assumption of having to know the compositional
   sources of the water. In its application to an upland peat catchment,
   the study supports the view that shallow throughflow at the
   catotelm/acrotelm boundary is responsible for storm runoff generation
   and shows that baseflow is controlled by cation exchange in the catotelm
   and mixing with a base-rich groundwater. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley

Title = {{Determining long time-scale hyporheic zone flow paths in Antarctic
   streams}},

Abstract = {{In the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, glaciers are the source of
   meltwater during the austral summer, and the streams and adjacent
   hyporheic zones constitute the entire physical watershed; there are no
   hillslope processes in these systems. Hyporheic zones can extend several
   metres from each side of the stream, and are up to 70 cm deep,
   corresponding to a lateral cross-section as large as 12 m(2), and water
   resides in the subsurface year around. In this study, we differentiate
   between the near-stream hyporheic zone, which can be characterized with
   stream tracer experiments, and the extended hyporheic zone, which has a
   longer time-scale of exchange. We sampled stream water from Green Creek
   and from the adjacent saturated alluvium for stable isotopes of D and
   (18)O to assess the significance and extent of stream-water exchange
   between the streams and extended hyporheic zones over long time-scales
   (days to weeks). Our results show that water residing in the extended
   hyporheic zone is much more isotopically enriched (up to 11parts per
   thousand D and 2-2parts per thousand (18)O) than stream water. This
   result suggests a long residence time within the extended hyporheic
   zone, during which fractionation has occurred owing to summer
   evaporation and winter sublimation of hyporheic water. We found less
   enriched water in the extended hyporheic zone later in the flow season,
   suggesting that stream water may be exchanged into and out of this zone,
   on the time-scale of weeks to months. The transient storage model OTIS
   was used to characterize the exchange of stream water with the extended
   hyporheic zone. Model results yield exchange rates (a) generally an
   order magnitude lower (10(-5) s(-1)) than those determined using
   stream-tracer techniques on the same stream. In light of previous
   studies in these streams, these results suggest that the hyporheic zones
   in Antarctic streams have near-stream zones of rapid stream-water
   exchange, where `fast' biogeochemical reactions may influence water
   chemistry, and extended hyporheic zones, in which slower biogeochemical
   reaction rates may affect stream-water chemistry at longer time-scales.

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2-D) hydraulic models are currently at the forefront of
   research into river flood inundation prediction. Airborne scanning laser
   altimetry is an important new data source that can provide such models
   with spatially distributed floodplain topography together with
   vegetation heights for parameterization of model friction. The paper
   investigates how vegetation height data can be used to realize the
   currently unexploited potential of 2-D flood models to specify a
   friction factor at each node of the finite element model mesh. The only
   vegetation attribute required in the estimation of floodplain node
   friction factors is vegetation height. Different sets of flow resistance
   equations are used to model channel sediment, short vegetation, and tall
   and intermediate vegetation. The scheme was tested in a modelling study
   of a flood event that occurred on the River Severn, UK, in October 1998.
   A synthetic aperture radar image acquired during the flood provided an
   observed flood extent against which to validate the predicted extent.
   The modelled flood extent using variable friction was found to agree
   with the observed extent almost everywhere within the model domain. The
   variable-friction model has the considerable advantage that it makes
   unnecessary the unphysical fitting of floodplain and channel friction
   factors required in the traditional approach to model calibration.

Abstract = {{This study examined suspended sediment concentration (SSC) during the
   ablation seasons of 2000 and 2001 in Place Creek, Canada. a steep,
   glacier-fed mountain stream. Comparison of stream flow in Place Creek
   with that in an adjacent, almost unglacierized catchment provided a
   rational basis for separating the ablation seasons into nival,
   nival-glacial, glacial and autumn recession subseasons. Distinct
   groupings of points in plots of electrical conductivity against
   discharge supported the validity of the subseasonal divisions in terms
   of varying hydrological conditions. Relationships between SSC and
   discharge (Q) varied between the two study seasons, and between
   subseasons. Hysteresis in the SSC-Q relationship was evident at both
   event and weekly time-scales. Some suspended sediment released from
   proalacial Place Lake (the source of Place Creek) appeared to be lost to
   channel storage at low flows, especially early in the ablation season,
   with re-entrainment at higher flows. Multiple regression models were
   derived for the subseasons using predictor vaniables including Q, Q(2),
   the change in Q over the previous 3 h, cumulative discharge over the
   ablation season, total precipitation over the previous 24 h and SSC
   measured at 1500 hours as an index value for each day. The models
   produced adjusted R-2 values ranging from 0.71 to 0.91, and provided
   tentative insights into the differences in SSC dynamics amongst
   subseasons. Introduction of the index value of SSC significantly
   improved the model fit during the nival-glacial and glacial subseasons
   for both years, as it adjusts the model to the current condition of
   sediment supply. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The ordinary kriging method, a geostatistical interpolation technique,
   was applied for developing contour maps of design storm depth in
   northern Taiwan using intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) data. Results
   of variogram modelling on design storm depths indicate that the design
   storms can be categorized into two distinct storm types: (i) storms of
   short duration and high spatial variation and (ii) storms of long
   duration and less spatial variation. For storms of the first category,
   the influence range of rainfall depth decreases when the recurrence
   interval increases, owing to the increasing degree of their spatial
   independence. However, for storms of the second category, the influence
   range of rainfall depth does not change significantly and has an average
   of approximately 72 km. For very extreme events, such as events of short
   duration and long recurrence interval, we do not recommend usage of the
   established design storm contours, because most of the interstation
   distances exceed the influence ranges. Our study concludes that the
   influence range of the design storm depth is dependent on the design
   duration and recurrence interval and is a key factor in developing
   design storm contours. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Direct measurements of the hydrological conditions for the occurrence of
   debris flows and of flow behaviour are of the outmost importance for
   developing effective flow prevention techniques. An automated and
   remotely controlled monitoring system was installed in Acquabona Creek
   in the Dolomites, Italian Eastern Alps, where debris flows occur every
   year. Its present configuration consists of three on-site stations,
   located in the debris-flow initiation area, in the lower channel and in
   the retention basin. The monitoring system is equipped with sensors for
   measuring rainfall, pore-water pressure in the mobile channel bottom,
   ground vibrations, debris flow depth, total normal stress and fluid
   pore-pressure at the base of the flow. Three video cameras take motion
   pictures of the events at the initiation zone, in the lower channel and
   in the deposition area. Data from the on-site stations are
   radio-transmitted to an off-site station and stored in a host PC, from
   where they are telemetrically downloaded and used by the Padova
   University for the study of debris flows. The efficiency of the sensors
   and of the whole monitoring system has been verified by the analysis of
   data collected so far. Examples of these data are presented and briefly
   discussed. If implemented at the numerous debris-flow sites in the
   Dolomitic Region, the technology used, derived from the development of
   this system, will provide civil defence and warn residents of impending
   debris flows. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Pond-cypress (Taxodium ascendens Brong.) is a dominant canopy species in
   depressional wetlands of the south-eastern Coastal Plain. Unsustainable
   withdrawals from the karst Floridan aquifer system have caused premature
   decline and death of pond-cypress trees, presumably owing to altered
   hydroperiods (which alter the flow of water and nutrients in trees).
   There has been no scientifically based means to determine sustainable
   yield from this regional aquifer system or to detect early stages of
   physical/ecological damage associated with groundwater mining and
   aquifer storage and recovery (ASR, which also can alter natural
   hydroperiods). In this study, the relationship between visual symptoms
   (indicators) of stress or premature decline, and spectral reflectance
   was evaluated using dried, milled branch tips collected from natural
   stands of mature pond-cypress. Depressional systems evaluated
   represented four of the six aquifer system subregions where subsurface
   perturbations from groundwater mining: (i) were presumed not to be
   occurring (reference wetlands); (ii) may be occurring but are not
   documented; and (iii) have been confirmed. Sampled trees were assigned
   to one of three stress classes (1, no/minimal; 2, moderate; 3, severe)
   based on the visual indicators. Partial least squares-linear
   discriminant analysis of second derivative spectral transformations in
   the visible/shortwave near-infrared (NIR) region (400-1100 nm) and the
   NIR region (1100-2500 nm) was used to evaluate the samples in assigned
   classes.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of a hedge surrounding bottornland on soil-water movement
   along the hillslope was studied on a plot scale for 28 months. The study
   was based on the comparison of two transects, one with a hedge, the
   other without, using mainly a dense grid of tensiometers. The influence
   of the bottomland hedge was located in the area where tree roots were
   developed, several metres upslope from the hedge, and could be observed
   both in the saturated and non-saturated zone, from May to December. The
   hedge induced a high rate of soil drying, because of the high
   evaporative capacity of the trees. We evaluated that water uptake by the
   hedge during the growing season was at least 100 mm higher than without
   a hedge. This increased drying rate led to a delayed rewetting of the
   soils upslope from the hedge in autumn, of about 1 month compared with
   the situation without a hedge. Several consequences of this delayed
   rewetting are expected: a delay in the return of subsurface transfer
   from the hillslope to the riparian zone, a buffering effect of hedges on
   floods, already observed at the catchment scale, and an increased
   residence time of pollutants. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the interactions of water, oxygen, temperature,
   suspended sediment and topsoil texture of bedwork watermeadows. These
   ancient grassland irrigation systems survive on the floodplain around
   Salisbury, England but recent interest in their conservation and
   rehabilitation is not matched by detailed understanding of their
   operation. The dominant `bedwork' form, by which water runs along the
   top of ridges and down `panes', enables water to move swiftly through
   the sward and drain to avoid stagnation. This investigation demonstrates
   that condition of surface flow and rates of infiltration encourage the
   solution of atmospheric oxygen in the water, offsetting potentially
   anaerobic conditions in the root zone. Temperature conditions imparted
   by the flow were measured and found to be conducive to the early growth
   of grass. Whereas the sediment budget was found to be conservative under
   a steady-state hydraulic regime, there is substantial ingress of
   suspended sediment at the start of an irrigation event and the sward
   traps coarse to medium-sized silt particle fractions and influences
   topsoil texture. It is concluded that a study of watermeadow operation
   permits insights into the operation of floodplain processes in general.

Abstract = {{Vegetation and soil properties and their associated changes through time
   and space affect the various stages of soil erosion. The island of
   Ishigaki in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan is of particular concern because
   of the propensity of the red-soil-dominated watersheds in the area to
   contribute substantial sediment discharge to adjacent coastal areas.
   This paper discusses the application of remote sensing techniques in the
   retrieval of vegetation and soil parameters necessary for the
   distributed soil-loss modelling in small agricultural catchments and
   analyses the variation in erosional patterns and sediment distribution
   during rainfall events using numerical solutions of overland flow
   simulations and sediment continuity equations. To account for the
   spatial as well as temporal variability of selected parameters of the
   soil-loss equations, a method is proposed to account for the variability
   of associated vegetation cover based on their spectral characteristics
   as captured by remotely sensed data. To allow for complete spatial
   integration, modelling the movement of sediment is accomplished under a
   loose-coupled GIS computational framework. This study lends a
   theoretical support and empirical evidence to the role of vegetation as
   a potential agent for soil erosion control. Copyright (C) 2003 John

Abstract = {{Snow course measurements from 11 sites located in eastern and northern
   Finland were used to estimate the total interception evaporation of a
   winter season for different forest categories. We categorized the sites
   based on forest density and tree species. Results showed that
   interception loss from gross precipitation increased with forest
   density,and approached 30\% for a forest with the highest density class.
   Interception loss for the most common forest density class was 11\%.
   Interception losses were slightly larger in spruce forests than in pine,
   deciduous, or mixed forests. We provide suggestions as to how to design
   snow surveys to estimate wintertime interception evaporation better.
   Rough terrain and transition zones between forest and open areas should
   be avoided. Since evaporation fraction was strongly dependent on tree
   crown characteristics, snow course data should include direct estimates
   of canopy closure. Qualitative observations made by different observers
   should be given a reference frame to ensure comparability of records
   from different sites. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study concerns the problem of water erosion in the Sahel. Surface
   water and sediment yields (suspended matter and bedload) were monitored
   for 3 years (1998-2000) at the outlet of a small grazed catchment (1.4
   ha) in the northern part of Burkina Faso. The catchment consists of
   about! 64\% sandy deposits (DRY soil surface type), which support most
   of the vegetation, and about 34\% of crusted bare soils (ERO soil
   surface type). The annual solid-matter export is more than 90\%
   suspended sediment, varying between 4.0 and 8.4 t ha(-1). The bedload
   represents less than 10\% of soil losses. In a single flood event (10
   year return period), the sediment yield can reach 4.2 t ha(-1). During
   the period studied, a small proportion (20 to 32\%) of the floods was
   thus responsible for a large proportion (80\%) of the solid transport.
   Seasonal variation of the suspended-matter content was also observed:
   high mean values (9 g l(-1)) in June, decreasing in July and stabilizing
   in August (between: 2 and 4 g l(-1)). This behaviour may be a
   consequence of a reorganization of the soil surfaces that have been
   destroyed by trampling animals during the previous long dry season,
   vegetation growth (increase in the protecting effect of the herbaceous
   cover) and, to a lesser extent, particle-supply limitation (exhaustion
   of dust deposits during July). The particle-size distribution in the
   suspended matter collected at the catchment outlet is 60\% made up of
   clay: fraction <2 mum. The contribution of this clay is maximum when the
   water rises and its kaolinite/quartz ratio is then close to that of the
   ERO-type surfaces. This indicates that these surfaces are the main
   source of clay within the catchment. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{In large river basins, there may be considerable variations in both
   climate and land use across the region. The evapotranspiration that
   occurs over a basin may be drastically different from one part of the
   region to another. The potential influence of these variations in
   evapotranspiration estimated for the catchment is weakened by using a
   spatially based distributed hydrological model in such a study. Areal
   evapotranspiration is estimated by means of approaches requiring only
   meteorological data: the combination equation (CE) model and the
   complementary relationship approach-the complementary relationship areal
   evapotranspiration (CRAE) and advection-aridity (AA) models. The
   capability of three models to estimate the evapotranspiration of
   catchments with complex topography and land-use classification is
   investigated, and the models are applied to two catchments with
   different characteristics and scales for several representative years.
   Daily, monthly, and annual evapotranspiration are estimated with
   different accuracy. The result shows that the modified CE model may
   underestimate the evapotranspiration in some cases. The CRAE and AA
   models seem to be two kinds of effective alternatives for estimating
   catchment evapotranspiration. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Daily outflow frequencies and recession curves were used to identify
   differences in storage-outflow relationships between two different
   drainage systems, conventional and controlled drainage. A three-year
   (1996-1999) field drainage experiment was carried out on a loamy sand
   soil in southern Sweden. Plots with an area of 0.2 hectares were drained
   by conventional subsurface drainage (CD) or by controlled drainage (CWT1
   and CWT2). The controlled drainage system allowed the groundwater level
   in the soil to be varied during the year. It was kept at least 70 cm
   below the soil surface during the growing season but allowed to rise to
   a maximum of 20 cm below the soil surface during the rest of the year.
   Measurements were performed to record precipitation, drain outflow and
   groundwater levels. Daily values of outflow were divided into 10
   categories, based on the size of outflow. Recession curves of hourly
   measurement of outflow were selected. They behaved like single
   reservoirs and a linear storage-outflow model was applied. Least squares
   estimates of the parameters initial outflow, initial storage volume and
   retention constant were calculated.
   Controlled drainage had a significant effect on total drain outflow and
   outflow pattern during the three years of measurement. The total drain
   outflow was 70\% to 90\% smaller in CWT than in CD. The analysis
   revealed that the initial outflows were higher, the retention constant
   and the temporary storage lower in CWT. The hydrological impacts of the
   reduction in temporary storage were higher peak flow, shorter lag time
   and shorter recession time and these effects increased with an increased
   groundwater level. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in numerical algorithms have enabled the
   construction of three-dimensional models for the prediction of flows in
   open channels. These advances encompass improvements in both numerical
   solutions and the process representation required for an accurate system
   definition. However, to date, there is still little agreement on how to
   assess systematically and report the credibility of these simulations.
   This paper addresses this problem by adopting a Grid Convergence Index
   approach. The results indicate, for two simple hypothetical cases, a
   zero-degree confluence and a meander bend, that the numerical code can
   be verified to an acceptable numerical standard. However, it is shown
   that this does not mean that verification is complete, as the literature
   implies, as whilst the discretization resolution may be sufficient to
   verify one of the model variables it does not imply that every variable
   has converged. Furthermore, the scheme may still be insufficient to
   capture all the processes of interest that are operating within the
   chosen environment. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this research is to include expert knowledge as one part
   of the modelling system and therefore offer the chance to create a
   productive interaction system between expert, mathematical model (MMO8)
   and artificial neural networks (ANNs). In the present project, the first
   objective is to determine some parameters by the MMO8 model, introduced
   as ANN input parameters to forecast spring outflow. The second objective
   is first to investigate the effect of temporal information by taking
   current and past data sets and then to forecast spring outflow. The good
   results obtained reveal the merit of the ANNs-MMO8 combination, and
   specifically multilayer perceptron (MLP) models. This methodology, for a
   network with lower, lag and number hidden layer, consistently produced
   better performance. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Introducing a concept of equivalent mass depth of flow, this study
   describes the phenomenon of non-point source pollutant (metal) transport
   for pavement (or overland) flow in analogy with wave propagation in wide
   open channels. Hysteretic and normal mass rating curves are developed
   for runoff rate and mass of 12 dissolved and particulate-bound metal
   elements (pollutants) using the rainfall-runoff and water quality data
   of the 15 x 20 m(2) instrumented pavement in Cincinnati, USA. Normal
   mass rating curves developed for easy computation of pollutant load are
   found to be of a form similar to Manning's, which is valid for open
   channel flows. Based on the hysteresis analysis, wave types for
   dissolution and mixing of particulate-bound metals are identified. The
   analysis finds that the second-order partial-differential equation
   normally used for metal transport does not have the efficacy to describe
   fully the strong non-linear phenomena such as is described for various
   metal elements by dynamic waves. In addition, the proportionality
   concept of the popular SCS-CN concept is extended for determining the
   potential maximum metal mass M-p of all the 12 elements transported by a
   rain storm and related to the antecedent dry period (ADP). For the
   primary metal zinc element, M-p is found to increase with the ADP and
   vice versa. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A project to link the Dead Sea to the Red Sea via a canal is undergoing
   extensive study. In previous works, a generalized mathematical model
   describing the state of the Dead Sea and a simulation model to implement
   it have been developed. The model is extended to include the proposed
   canal project and investigates two alternative modelling canal
   scenarios: (1) introducing the canal water inflow into the bottom layer
   or (2) the top layer of the sea. The predicted general effects of the
   canal are the restoration of the water level of the sea to pre-1970s
   level; an increase in the total evaporation rate and a decrease in the
   top layer salinity. Implementing scenario 1, the model predicts that:
   the water level of the Dead Sea will exceed the desired level design
   value and therefore shorter filling time can be used; seasonal
   stratification will persist; total evaporation rate will increase
   Modestly; there will a small decrease in the salinity of the top layer
   but a substantial decrease in the salinity of the bottom layer, which
   will hurt industries severely; there will be a continuation of seasonal
   crystallization of aragonite and gypsum. Implementing scenario 2 the
   model predicts that: the water level of the Dead Sea will be maintained
   at the desired level design value; stratification will be
   re-established, with the formation of a permanent two-layer system;
   there will be a substantial increase in the total evaporation rate; the
   salinity of the top layer will decrease significantly but there will be
   continuous slower salinity increase in the bottom layer; the
   crystallization of aragonite will cease, but seasonal gypsum
   crystallization can be expected to continue as soon as the filling
   period ends and the canal shifts into normal operation. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Flushing sediment through a reservoir has been practiced successfully
   and found to be inexpensive in many cases. However, the great amount of
   water consumed in the flushing operation might affect the water supply.
   To satisfy the water demand and water consumed in the flushing
   operation, two models combining the reservoir simulation model and the
   sediment flushing model are established. In the reservoir simulation
   model, the genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize and determine the
   flushing operation rule curves. The sediment-flushing model is developed
   to estimate the amount of the flushed sediment volume, and the simulated
   results update the elevation-storage curve, which can be taken into
   account in the reservoir simulation model. The models are successfully
   applied to the Tapu reservoir, which has faced serious sedimentation
   problems. Based on 36 years historical sequential data, the results show
   that (i) the simulated flushing operation rule curves model has superior
   performance, in terms of lower shortage index (SI) and higher flushing
   efficiency (FE), than that by the original reservoir operation; (ii) the
   rational and riskless flushing schedule for the Tapu reservoir is
   suggested to be set within an interval of every 2 or 4 years in the
   months of May or June. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{During the autumn of 2000, large areas of England and Wales were
   affected by severe flooding, which caused widespread disruption and
   significant damage to property. This study attempts to determine the
   impact of these flood events on contaminated sediment dispersal and
   deposition in the River Swale catchment, Yorkshire, UK, where lead and
   zinc were extracted and processed in large quantities during the
   nineteenth century.
   Seventy samples of overbank and channel-edge sediments were collected at
   35 sites along the River Swale. Inductively coupled plasma-mass
   spectrometry was used to measure contaminant metal concentrations in the
   2000-63 mum (sand) and <63 mum (silt and clay) size fractions. In both
   the channel-edge and overbank sediments collected from the upper and
   middle reaches of the River Swale, concentrations of lead, zinc and
   cadmium were found to exceed MAFF guidelines. Highest concentrations
   correspond to the input of contaminated material from intensively mined
   tributaries, and elevated levels can be observed 5-10 km downstream of
   these inputs. This indicates that the remobilization of contaminated
   material during major flood events is potentially a serious problem for
   activities such as agriculture that utilize the Swale floodplain.

Abstract = {{Soil hydraulic parameter values for large-scale modelling cannot be
   obtained by direct methods. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) that relate
   soil hydraulic properties (SHPs) to generally available soil texture
   data may provide an alternative. A considerable number of PTF models has
   been developed, the application of three recent PTFs is evaluated. As a
   first step sets of SHPs derived from the PTFs are compared with measured
   sets of SHPs for three sites. No good agreement was found statistically
   between measured and PTF results or between PTF results. As a second
   step and from a practical point of view results for three hydrologically
   functional variables were compared and evaluated. The three selected
   functional variables are saturated hydraulic conductivity, k(0), in
   relation to infiltration excess runoff, available soil water amounts for
   evapotranspiration and water table depth for a specified upward flux or
   capillary rise. Derived k(0) distributions from PTFs show substantially
   less variance than from the measured data at all three sites. This can
   have a considerable impact on infiltration excess runoff, depending on
   the actual rainfall regime. Simulated available soil water amounts for
   evapotranspiration for some combinations of PTFs and sites are close to
   those obtained for measured SHPs, however, no consistency in results can
   be detected. Water table depths for specified upward flux densities
   using PTF derived SHPs are generally deeper than those based on measured
   SHPs and means a potentially higher water availability. Overall,
   differences in capillary rise among the selected PTFs and between
   measured and PTF based results are again inconsistent and show no clear
   relationship with soil texture. Finally, as a third step; effective SHPs
   were calculated by using spatially averaged texture as PTF input
   representing areal average behaviour. For these effective SHPs the
   calculated effective values for the three selected functional variables
   appear to be close to the areally averaged values obtained with step 2.
   The selected functional variables thus appear to depend linearly on the
   PTFs over the range for which the data are representative. This suggests
   that for our specific PTFs areal mean or effective values for the three
   functional variables can be obtained fairly accurately from a single
   measurement of a bulk collection of soil samples as input. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Most water in the Parana River drainage basin is supplied by the
   tropical Upper Parana (over 60\% of the total annual water discharge,
   550 km(3)). The total suspended solids (TSS) load (c. 80 X 10(6) t
   year(-1)), however, is essentially furnished (50-70\%) by the
   mountainous, and and mostly sediment-mantled upper Bermejo River
   drainage basin. This characteristic suggests that the Parana River solid
   load (TSS, 600 km upstream from the mouth) is largely recycled
   sedimentary material, whose discharge-weighted mean chemical index of
   alteration is c. 71. The extended UCC-normalized multi-elemental
   diagrams are similar to those of other world rivers. Nevertheless, the
   detailed inspection of UCC-normalized rare earth element (REE)
   `spidergrams' reveals a lithological source for the Parana River TSS
   that might be compatible with either tholeiitic flood basalts
   (widespread in the upper drainage) or with young Andean intermediate
   volcanic rocks. In view of the Bermejo River's dominant role as a
   sediment contributor, we feel that the signature preserved in the
   Parana's TSS is the latter. Conversely, the Uruguay River TSS REE
   signature is certainly determined by the extensive weathering products

Abstract = {{This study evaluates temporal variations of physicochemical variables
   and densities of phytoplankton and zooplankton, under different flow
   conditions. Four samplings were carried out at four sites on the Lower
   Delta of the Parana River (Argentina). This first approach was developed
   in 1995 and included a flood of high amplitude and average duration.
   Daily data analysis along the year qualified sampling water levels as
   very high, medium (two opportunities) and low level. Triplicate
   subsuperficial water samples were taken in the middle of the navigation
   channel. Dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity and temperature were
   determined in situ; nutrients and concentration of major solutes in the
   laboratory. Quantitative samples of phytoplankton (concentrated by
   sedimentation) and zooplankton (80 1; 48 pm) were obtained. Temporal
   variation of most physical, chemical and biological variables exceeded
   the spatial variation. Physicochemical variables were mainly associated
   in time with the hydrological regime. In the main channel water exchange
   originated by the flood of marshy environments caused dissolved oxygen,
   nitrate and sulphate to decrease and phosphate, conductivity,
   bicarbonate, calcium and magnesium to increase. The
   dilution-concentration action of flow was evidenced in chloride
   variation (conservative ion). The plankton variables would be affected
   directly and indirectly by water level, and also by seasonal climatic
   condition. The densities of phytoplankton and zooplankton increased
   during low flow. For some organisms, the variation in density exceeded
   the simple concentration effect of flow decrease. The lowest plankton
   densities coincided with a temperature minimum. Copyright (C) 2003 John

Abstract = {{The western Sierra Madre is the main water-providing area of northern
   Mexico. However, most of this mountain range has suffered a progressive
   degradation of soils and vegetation due to overgrazing and
   deforestation, for four or five decades. The objective of this study is
   to determine the impacts of these changes on water balance and
   hydrodynamic basin behaviour.
   The hydrological data of two basins (the Sextin basin, 4660 km(2) and
   the Ramos basin, 7130 km(2)) of this area were analysed. Annual runoff
   coefficients have not changed. Therefore, other indices were used to
   determine changes in the streamflow regime:
   an index of irregularity of daily discharge; the separation of flood
   flow and base flow; the lag time of the watersheds; the baseflow
   recession index; the two-day recession index.
   Some changes were noticeable at the basin scale in the water balance of
   the catchments:
   the ratio of the flood runoff coefficient to the base runoff coefficient
   increased from the 1970s to the 1990s;
   the basin lag time decreased 2.1\% in the Ramos basin and 6.1\% in the
   Sextin basin;
   the two-day recession index and the baseflow recession index increased,
   reflecting a more rapid decrease of streamflow after the peak flow;
   the mean annual runoff coefficient and the irregularity as estimated by
   the index used here showed no significant evolution.
   The convergence of such observations confirms that dramatic changes in
   the evolution of water resources in the near future in this area are to
   be expected, if the current land use is not strongly modified. Water
   management and dam operation would also be seriously affected. Copyright

Abstract = {{The reduction of pollutant loads in rivers requires a good comprehension
   of the contribution of all major (point and diffuse) sources in each
   sub-basin. Due to the sudden change of a centrally planned economy to a
   free-market economy in 1989, the River Elbe is one of the fastest
   changing transboundary river basins in Central Europe. The
   quantification of fluxes of heavy metals in the Elbe basin requires
   information on the spatial and temporal characteristics of emissions and
   on physical boundary conditions of the entire river basin. In this
   paper, a GIS-based model METALPOL will be presented, that describes the
   load of five heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, Zn) in the Elbe basin over
   the period 1985-1999 as a function of (1) emissions from point and
   diffuse sources, (2) runoff, (3) soil types, (4) land use and (5)
   hydrogeology. The results from the model were validated with the
   measured heavy metal loads and showed reasonable agreement. Between 64\%
   (for Hg) and 84\% (for Pb) of the total heavy metal emissions in the
   Elbe basin is supplied by inputs from diffuse sources. The diffuse
   hydrological pathways with the highest share are erosion and urban
   areas. In most cases the measured heavy metal load is lower than the sum
   of the heavy metal emissions. Retention processes (e.g. sedimentation)
   largely explain this behaviour and are found to be dependent on the
   specific runoff of a catchment. About 81-97\% of variance for the
   different heavy metals can be explained by the dependency on specific
   runoff. The uncertainty analysis presented in this paper has also
   illustrated that the reliability of the model simulations is directly
   affected by the quality of the input data (especially point source and
   urban emissions) and the distribution of the input data like rainfall
   data, emission data, soil data and land cover data. Finally, scenario
   analysis indicated that the current proposed measures are not stringent
   enough to achieve large reductions in heavy metal loads in the Elbe
   basin. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a joint Brazilian-French project, entitled `Hydrology and
   Geochemistry of the Amazon Basin', we carried out a seven-year study
   (1994-2000) on the distribution, behaviour and flux of particulate and
   dissolved organic carbon in the Amazon River and its main tributaries
   (the Negro, Solimoes, Branco, Madeira, Tapajos, Xingu and Trombetas
   rivers).
   The concentrations of particulate and dissolved organic carbon varied
   from one river to another and according to the season, but dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) always accounted for about 70\% of the total
   organic carbon (TOC). The mean concentration of dissolved organic carbon
   was 6.1 mg l(-1) in the Madeira River, 5.83 mg l(-1) in the Solimoes
   River and 12.7 mg l(-1) in the Negro River. The percentage in weight of
   the particulate organic carbon decreased as the concentration of
   suspended matter increased. The Solimoes River contributed the most
   carbon to the Amazon River: about 500 kg C s(-1) during the high water
   period and about 300 kg C s(-1) during the low water period. However,
   the temporal variations in organic carbon in the Amazon River (i.e.
   downstream of Manaus) are basically controlled by inputs from the Negro
   River and its variations. The Negro River does not produce a simple
   dilution effect. During the high water period (between March and August)
   the TOC flux, calculated as the sum of the Solimoes, Negro and Madeira
   tributaries, was about 5.7 x 10(13) g C yr(-1), whereas during the low
   water period (between September and February) the TOC flux was about 2.6
   x 10(13) g C yr(-1).
   The mean annual flux of TOC at Obidos (the final gauging station
   upstream of the estuary) was about 3.27 x 10(13) g C yr(-1) (i.e. 32.7
   +/- 3.3 Tg yr(-1)). Of this, the flux of DOC represents about 2.7 x
   10(13) g C yr(-1) and the flux of particulate organic carbon (POC)
   represents about 0.5 x 10(13) g C yr(-1). The mean annual input of TOC
   by all tributaries (Negro, Solimoes, Madeira, Trombetas, Tapajos and
   Xingu) was about 2.8 x 10(13) g C yr(-1). When we compared this input
   with the output recorded at Obidos (3.27 x 10(13) g C yr(-1)), we found
   that the amount of organic carbon increased (about 0.4 x 10(13) g C
   yr(-1)). This shows that other important sources of organic carbon exist
   in the lower reaches of the Amazon River. These inputs can be attributed
   to the adjacent floodplain lake system, called `varzea'. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The distribution of trace metals (V, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, As, Rb, Sr, Mo,
   Cd, Sb, Cs, Ba, U) was investigated in surface waters and associated
   particulates in the Amazon mainstream (Solimoes and Amazon rivers).
   Dissolved V, Cu, As, Sr, Ba, U correlate with major ions and appear to
   be predominantly derived from soluble rocks occurring in the Amazon
   upper basin. These elements appear conservative in waters and are
   progressively diluted by less-concentrated waters coming from the
   lowland and shield areas. A monthly time series obtained at the Obidos
   gauging station shows that temporal variability of trace element
   concentrations reflects the source, remobilization and/or biological
   processes occurring in the channel or in the surrounding floodplain
   lakes. The trace element concentrations in the particulate matter show a
   clear relationship with the location of the samples. V, Co, Cr, Mn, Sr,
   Cs and Ba concentrations are higher in the Solimoes and the Rio Negro is
   enriched in Fe, Al and Zn. In the Rio Solimoes, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn,
   Cs and Pb are almost entirely carried by the river particulate matter;
   Cu, Rb, Sr, Ba and U are transported mainly by the suspended particles,
   but a dissolved phase contributes to the transport. In the Rio Negro,
   the proportion of elements transported by the dissolved phase is higher
   for the whole set of elements. The implications of these results allow
   us to compute the fluxes from the Amazon River to the Atlantic Ocean.

Abstract = {{The chemical composition of the Amazon River results from the mixing of
   two water types: black water and white water. On-site fractionation by
   sequential tangential ultrafiltration (STUF) was used to differentiate
   transported organic carbon and to determine the distribution and
   association of major and trace elements with different size fraction of
   the organic carbon (OC). Several sampling campaigns (1994-1996) allow a
   monthly quantification of particulate (OC(P), Me(P)), colloidal (OC(C),
   Me(C)) and dissolved (OC(D), Me(D)) organic carbon and metal ions
   inputs. In white rivers the OC is mainly concentrated in the low
   molecular weight fraction (OC(D) < 5000 D) while in black rivers most of
   the OC is in the heavier molecular weight fractions (OC(P) and OC(C) > 5
   kDa). For Mg, Ca and K, 50\% of the total amount of each element is
   found in fraction MeD while 15\% and 35\% are found in fractions Me(C)
   and Me(P), respectively. Al and Fe are in the particulate fraction at
   99\% of the total metal concentration for all river samples. This work
   emphasizes the coagulation processes and the sink for elements in the
   mixing zone. These physicochemical transformations of the organic matter
   vary seasonally. The changes happen during the transition periods:
   before high-level waters and before low-level waters. By way of flux
   measurement, a seasonal carbon loss was observed. The estimated annual
   organic carbon flux of the Amazon at Obidos is 28 x 10(6) t. At the same
   time, an average of 9 x 10(6) t of organic carbon per year is retained
   in the reach between Manaus and Obidos, probably via coagulation
   processes. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The rare earth element (REE) concentrations of the dissolved and
   particulate fractions and bed sediment between Manaus and Santarem in
   the Amazon River, and in some major tributaries, were evaluated. A very
   important zone in the Amazon basin, the `encontro das aguas' area where
   the Rio Solimoes and the Rio Negro meet, was especially sampled.
   Different size fractions were isolated by ultrafiltration. Water samples
   were collected at different stages of the mixing. Three groups of waters
   are distinguished: group I has a low pH (<5.5) and is represented by the
   Negro basin rivers; group 11 has alkalinity less than 0.2 meq l(-1) and
   is represented by the Rios Tapajos and Trombetas; group III has high
   alkalinity (>0.2 meq l(-1)) and higher pH (>6.5) and is represented by
   the Madeira basin rivers, the Solimoes and the Amazon. The highest
   dissolved REE concentration is in the Rio Negro and the lowest in the
   Rio Tapajos (dissolved REEs vary by more than a factor of ten). The
   solubility of REEs is pH dependent: in river waters with a pH < 6 the Cc
   concentration is twice that of La, whereas in rivers with a higher pH
   the concentrations of Ce and La are similar. Dissolved REE
   concentrations are positively correlated with the dissolved organic
   carbon. Correlations between Fe, Al, and La suggest that La is
   associated with Al (Fe)-rich organic matter and/or related to dissolved
   Fe-rich inorganic material. Dissolved REES normalized to North American
   shale composite show an enrichment in intermediate/heavy REEs (from Eu
   to Er), except for the shields rivers (such as Rio Negro and Rio
   Trombetas). Both of them are depleted in heavy REEs and show a relative
   Cc enrichment. In contrast, for the Andeans rivers (such as Rio
   Solimoes), light REEs are slightly depleted and a negative Cc relative
   anomaly occurs. The pattern of the Amazon River at Obidos confirms the
   major influence of the Rios Negro and Solimoes with REE fractionation.
   For the Rio Negro, 60 to 70\% of REEs are concentrated in the
   particulate fraction (>0.2 mum), 20 to 30\% are in the colloidal
   fraction (0.2 mum to 5000 Da) and less than 10\% are in solution (<5000
   Da). For the Solimoes the distribution is different. More than 95\% of
   REEs are in the particulate fraction. In the mixing area, the colloidal
   fraction is enriched in heavy REEs. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{The nature and distribution of organic matter in the mixing zone of
   black (Rio Negro) and white (Rio Solimoes) waters in the Amazon River
   was studied to understand the processes responsible for its transport
   and distribution. Water samples from 13 stations, including Rio Negro,
   Rio Solimoes and Rio Madeira and ten stations downstream of the
   confluence with the Amazon, were collected during a low-water period.
   Particulate organic matter (POM; >0.7 mum) and dissolved organic matter
   (DOM; <0.7 mum) were quantified by analysing elemental carbon and
   nitrogen and by high-temperature catalytic oxidation, and characterized
   by infrared spectrometry and fluorescence microscopy. We also performed
   adsorption experiments with DOM and alumina particles to determine the
   adsorption abilities and the nature of the most reactive DOM. Adsorption
   was estimated by measuring the amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   lost during the experiments. We found a significant difference between
   the measured and theoretical fluxes of the two end members in DOC
   (-52\%), particulate organic carbon (-32\%), and particulate organic
   nitrogen (-59\%). This suggests that organic matter is not conservative
   at the confluence of the two rivers. Among processes affecting POM and
   DOM during the mixing of the two rivers, adsorption may be one of the
   principal mechanisms by which the dissolved fraction is removed.
   Adsorption experiments showed that up to ca 40\% of DOC can be removed
   by adsorption reactions. Furthermore, dissolved organic nitrogen was
   preferentially adsorbed onto alumina surfaces, which may be important
   for the fractionation of organic matter in the Amazon river system and
   seems to be related to the origin and freshness of the DOM. Copyright

Abstract = {{This study describes the transport and speciation of mercury (Hg) and
   the associated role of organic matter in these processes at the
   confluence of the Negro ('black waters') and Solirmoes ('white waters')
   Rivers, which form the Amazon River. The Negro has the highest total Hg
   content (11.6 to 18.2 ng l(-1)) due to the extreme particulate Hg
   concentrations (2074 ng g(-1) at the surface), 10 to 20 times higher
   than those measured in other Amazon tributaries. The total organic
   carbon (TOC) consists primarily of dissolved organic carbon, which
   corresponds to 89\% and 66\% of the TOC in the Negro and Solimoes Rivers
   respectively, and is mainly composed of humic substances, carriers for
   most of the metal ions transported in rivers. At the confluence of the
   Negro and Solimoes Rivers, the total Hg concentrations decrease
   markedly. An isotopic mass balance showed that the complete mixing of
   the two rivers was achieved 25 km downstream of the confluence. At 60 km
   downstream of the confluence, the flux of Hg decreases to 73 kg day(-1),
   which represents a net losses of 5 kg day(-1) and 15 kg day(-1) of
   dissolved Hg and particulate Hg respectively, assuming that the
   discharge was constant during the sampling survey and without
   significant lateral input. Moreover, the Hg losses are correlated with
   the total suspended matter concentrations, which vary throughout the
   mixing zone, and also with the particulate and dissolved organic carbon
   distribution. We suggest that the dissolved loss occurs during the
   flocculation of organic matter within the zone of rapidly changing
   physical and chemical conditions downstream of the confluence, and that
   the particulate loss is by the deposition of particles along the mixing
   zone favoured by decreasing stream velocities during the sampling
   survey. Adsorption processes of Hg on dissolved organic matter seem to
   be responsible for the decrease of dissolved Hg concentrations in the
   mixing zone. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We analysed carbon, nitrogen and delta(13)C values in sediment sampled
   in the Amazon floodplains. The surface sediment samples were collected
   along inland transects divided according to their vegetation cover: (a)
   forest, where the dominant vegetation was inundation forests; (b) grass,
   where the dominant vegetation was grasses, mainly from Echnochloa
   polystachya; (c) mixed, where the vegetation changed from grasses near
   the river bank to forest inland. The average sediment carbon and
   nitrogen concentrations were significantly higher in forest samples (C =
   0.99\%, N = 0.12\%) than in grass samples (C = 0.84\%, N = 0.10\%). The
   average sediment delta(13)C was significantly heavier in grass
   (-26.7parts per thousand) than in forest samples (-28.6parts per
   thousand), reflecting the isotopically heavier C-4 grasses carbon. In
   the forest and mixed transects inland, increases in the carbon and
   nitrogen concentrations were observed. At approximately 50 to 60 m from
   the riverbank, the concentration of carbon and nitrogen became similar
   to the river particulate organic carbon (POC) concentration, which is
   the primary floodplain sediment source. We hypothesized that this trend
   is caused by the deposition of carbon- and nitrogen-depleted sand-size
   particles in the first few metres of the floodplain, whereas the more
   enriched silt-clay particles are preferentially deposited far inland. In
   contrast to inland trends, no significant downriver trend was observed
   in the carbon and nitrogen concentrations. However, a downriver
   delta(13)C increase was observed for sediment in grass-covered areas.
   Based on delta(13)C values in different varzea environments, we
   estimated the relative contribution of riverine POC and vegetation
   material present in the varzea sediments under different vegetation
   covers. For forest sediment samples we estimated that 60\% of the carbon
   was derived from the riverine POC and the forests provided the remaining
   40\%. For open areas covered with grasses we estimated that only 10\%
   was derived from these plants, and 90\% was derived from riverine POC.

Abstract = {{The Amazon floodplain (varzea) is seasonally affected by water level
   fluctuations of the Solimoes/Amazon River. The drastic environmental
   changes that occur also include microbiological processes, such as
   nitrogen (N(2)) fixation and denitrification. Both processes were
   measured in the soil by the acetylene reduction assay and the acetylene
   block method in a varzea forest on Ilha de Marchantaria, Central
   Amazonia, Brazil. In the surface soil horizon (0-5 cm), N(2) fixation
   was highest during the exposed period (0.04-0.26 nmolN h(-1) g(-1) dry
   weight (dw)). In contrast, denitrification varied from 0 to 1.40 nmolN
   h(-1) g(-1) dw, with high rates during the submerged and the transition
   periods. No significant difference between locations with legume trees,
   with non-legume trees and without trees could be observed. N(2) fixation
   rates of incubations (litter down to 450 cm depth) for samples collected
   during the exposed period ranged from 0 to 0.11 nmolN h(-1) g(-1) dw,
   with highest rates in the surface soil horizon (0-5 cm). Denitrification
   ranged from 0 to 0.05 nmolN h(-1) g(-1) dw, with the highest rate at
   250-300 cm depth, which was just below the water table. The maximum N(2)
   fixation rate (0.89 nmolN h(-1) g(-1) dw) and denitrification rate (0.09
   nmolN h(-1) g(-1) dw) occurred in the litter layer. On average, at least
   three times as much N is lost from the surface soil horizon via
   denitrification than is gained by N(2) fixation annually, but the rates
   are strongly influenced by the flood pulse. Copyright (C) 2003 John

Abstract = {{Methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from Brazilian
   reservoirs were assessed. Point measurements were made during 1998 and
   1999 (using inverted funnels for bubbles and air and water concentration
   gradients for diffusion) in the 559 km(2) Samuel reservoir, which was
   initially flooded in 1988, and the 2430 km(2) Tucurui reservoir, which
   was flooded in 1984, and the data were evaluated with respect to
   historical measurements in other Brazilian reservoirs. Bubble emissions
   of CH4 were higher in Samuel (ranging from 2 to 70 mgCH(4) m(-2)
   day(-1)) than in Tucurui (ranging from 0.5 to 30 mgCH(4) m(-2) day(-1)),
   with the highest values occurring the shallowest regions in each
   reservoir. CH4 from diffusion for the Tucurui reservoir ranged from 5 to
   30 mgCH(4) m(-2) day(-1), which is lower than that for the Samuel
   reservoir, which ranged from 10 to 80 mgCH(4) m(-2) day(-1). The smaller
   emissions in Tucurui compared with Samuel are attributed to a larger
   depletion in the source organic material that was present when the
   reservoir was filled. The CO2 concentration was similar for each
   reservoir, and ranged from 1000 to 10000 mgCO(2) m(-2) day(-1).

Abstract = {{We investigated the potential effects of rainfall intensity smoothing by
   forest canopies on slope stability by modelling soil responses to
   measured rainfall and throughfall during high-intensity rain. Field
   measurements showed that maximum intensities of precipitation were
   generally reduced under forest canopies at two sites in the Pacific
   Northwest, USA. Modelling soil water pore-pressure responses of a
   hypothetical hillslope to the field data resulted in estimates of slope
   stability that were generally greater under forest canopy than for the
   same hillslope without forest canopy. Results indicate that smoothing of
   precipitation intensities may translate into overall greater stability
   of hillslopes under forest canopies. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{On 28-30 July 2000, an extreme melt event was observed at John Evans
   Glacier (JEG), Ellesmere Island (79degrees40'N, 74degrees00'W). Hourly
   melt rates during this event fell in the upper 4\% of the distribution
   of melt rates observed at the site during the period 1996-2000. Synoptic
   conditions during the event resulted in strong east-to-west flow over
   the northern sector of the Greenland Ice Sheet, with descending flow on
   the northwest side reaching Ellesmere Island. On JEG, wind speeds during
   the event averaged 8(.)1 m s(-1) at 1183 m a.s.l., with hourly mean wind
   speeds peaking at 11(.)6 m s(-1). Air temperatures reached 8degreesC,
   and rates of surface lowering measured by an ultrasonic depth gauge
   averaged 56 mm day(-1). Calculations with an energy balance model
   suggest that increased turbulent fluxes contributed to melt enhancement
   at all elevations on the glacier, while snow albedo feedback resulted in
   increased melting due to net radiation at higher elevations. The event
   was responsible for 30\% of total summer melt at 1183 m a.s.l. and 15\%
   at 850 m a.s.l. Conditions similar to those during the event occurred on
   only 0(.)1\% of days in the period 1948-2000, but 61\% of events
   occurred in the summer months and there was an apparent clustering of
   events in the 1950s and 1980s. Such events have the potential to impact
   significantly on runoff, mass balance and drainage system development at
   high Arctic glaciers, and changes in their incidence could play a role
   in determining how high Arctic glaciers respond to climate change and
   variability. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Soil moisture and its isotopic composition were observed at Spasskaya
   Pad experimental forest near Yakutsk, Russia, during summer in 1998,
   1999, and 2000. The amount of soil water (plus ice) was estimated from
   volumetric soil water content obtained with time domain reflectometry.
   Soil moisture and its delta(18)O showed large interannual variation
   depending on the amount of summer rainfall. The soil water delta(18)O
   decreased with soil moisture during a dry summer (1998), indicating that
   ice meltwater from a deeper soil layer was transported upward. On the
   other hand, during a wet summer (1999), the delta(18)O of soil water
   increased due to percolation of summer rain with high delta(18)O values.
   Infiltration after spring snowmelt can be traced down to 15 cm by the
   increase in the amount of soil water and decrease in the delta(18)O
   because of the low delta(18)O of deposited snow. About half of the snow
   water equivalent (about 50 mm) recharged the surface soil. The pulse of
   the snow meltwater was, however, less important than the amount of
   summer rainfall for intra-annual variation of soil moisture.
   Excess water at the time just before soil freezing, which is controlled
   by the amount of summer rainfall, was stored as ice during winter. This
   water storage stabilizes the rate of evapotranspiration. Soil water
   stored in the upper part of the active layer (surface to about 120 cm)
   can be a water source for transpiration in the following summer. On the
   other hand, once water was stored in the lower part of the active layer
   (deeper than about 120 cm), it would not be used by plants in the
   following summer, because the lower part of the active layer thaws in
   late summer after the plant growing season is over. Copyright (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Continuous wavelet analyses of hourly time series of air temperature,
   stream discharge, and precipitation are used to compare the seasonal and
   inter-annual variability in hydrological regimes of the two principal
   streams feeding Bow Lake, Banff National Park, Alberta: the glacial
   stream draining the Wapta Icefields, and the snowmelt-fed Bow River. The
   goal is to understand how water sources and flow routing differ between
   the two catchments. Wavelet spectra and cross-wavelet spectra were
   determined for air temperature and discharge from the two streams for
   summers (June-September) 1997-2000, and for rainfall and discharge for
   the summers of 1999 and 2000. The diurnal signal of the glacial runoff
   was orders of magnitude higher in 1998 than in other years, indicating
   that significant ice exposure and the development of channelized glacial
   drainage occurred as a result of the 1997-98 El Nino conditions. Early
   retreat of the snowpack in 1997 and 1998 led to a significant
   summer-long input of melt runoff from a small area of ice cover in the
   Bow River catchment; but such inputs were not apparent in 1999 and 2000,
   when snow cover was more extensive. Rainfall had a stronger influence on
   runoff and followed quicker flow paths in the Bow River catchment than
   in the glacial catchment. Snowpack thickness and catchment size were the
   primary controls on the phase relationship between temperature and
   discharge at diurnal time scales. Wavelet analysis is a fast and
   effective means to characterize runoff, temperature, and precipitation
   regimes and their interrelationships and inter-annual variability. The
   technique is effective at identifying inter-annual and seasonal changes
   in the relative contributions of different water sources to runoff, and
   changes in the time required for routing of diurnal meltwater pulses
   through a catchment. However, it is less effective at identifying
   changes/differences in the type of the flow routing (e.g. overland flow
   versus through flow) between or within catchments. Copyright (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Hydrological fluxes and associated nutrient budget were studied during a
   2 year period (1998-99) in a montane moist evergreen broad-leaved forest
   at Ailao Mountain, Yunnan. Water samples of rainfall, throughfall, and
   stemflow, and of surface runoff, soil water, and stream flow were
   collected bimonthly to determine the concentration and fluxes of
   nutrients. Soil budgets were determined from the difference between
   precipitation input (including nutrient leaching from canopy) and output
   via runoff and drainage.
   The forest was characterized by low canopy interception and surface
   runoff, and high percolation and stream flow. Concentrations of
   nutrients were increased in throughfall and stemflow compared with
   precipitation. Surface runoff and drainage water had higher nutrient
   concentrations than precipitation and stream water. Total nitrogen and
   NH4+-N concentrations were higher in soil water than stream water,
   whereas K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ concentrations were lower in the former than
   the latter. Annual nutrient fluxes decreased with soil depth following
   the pattern of water flux. Annual losses of most nutrient elements via
   stream flow were less than the corresponding inputs via throughfall and
   stemflow, except for calcium, for which solute loss was greater than the
   inputs via precipitation. Leaching losses of that element may be
   compensated by weathering. Losses of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,
   magnesium, sodium, and sulphur could be replaced through atmospheric
   inputs. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The characteristics of evaporation from the ground surface of Asian
   cryosphere sites are presented, as estimated by the lysimeter method, a
   profile method, and a heat budget method. The observation sites were
   located on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, in the Qilian and Tianshan
   Mountains of China, and in eastern Siberia. The lysimeter method has
   been demonstrated to be a reliable observation technique for estimating
   daily evaporation from the land surface, given suitable experiment
   design and operation. Daily mean evaporation varied within the range of
   0(.)3 to 3(.)5 mm on the permafrost surface, and regional differences in
   evaporation were strongly related to surface soil moisture. Locally,
   topography, by way of its influence on surface soil moisture, was found
   to control evaporation systematically. Seasonality of ground evaporation
   in permafrost regions is dominated by thaw-freeze cycles at the surface;
   evaporation from the melting permafrost surface is up to four to seven
   times greater than that from frozen ground. In forested terrain, the
   interception of precipitation can reduce daily evaporation by 60 to
   70\%. Sublimation from the snow surface was observed at some sites in
   the range of 0(.)2 to 1(.)0 mm daily; atmospheric conditions, such as
   wind speed and saturation deficit, were dominant factors in determining
   snow sublimation. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Flow records, rising-stage sediment samplers, and a sand suspension
   model are used to examine suspended sediment concentrations during major
   floods caused by tropical cyclones TC Joni and TC Kina in the Rewa
   River, Fiji. The highest concentrations of total suspended solids were
   measured during the early stages of TC Kina. The suspension model
   predicts higher sand concentrations for TC Kina compared with TC Joni
   because of the larger slope and higher shear stresses during Kina.
   Extremely high wash load concentrations early in TC Kina are at least
   partly due to remobilization of fine sediment deposited during the
   earlier TC Joni flood. Samples from the TC Kina had volumetric
   concentrations larger than 5\%, indicating hyperconcentrated
   streamflows. Mass-density shear stresses in the hyperconcentrated flows
   are up 1(.)6 times larger than clear-water shear stresses, but they
   occur early during low stages of the flood and probably do not result in
   severe bed erosion. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Transpiration coefficient K-cb, crop coefficient K-c, and the ratio of
   transpiration to evapotranspiration (T/ET) are important parameters for
   pear orchard irrigation management and may vary with different methods
   of irrigation. This study investigated their changes under three
   irrigation methods: conventional flood irrigation (CFI), fixed partial
   rootzone drying and irrigation (FPRD) and alternative partial root-zone
   drying and irrigation (APRD), in a semi-arid region of Victoria,
   Australia. The average seasonal ET was 865(.)29, 795(.)63 and 804(.)72
   mm respectively for CFI, FPRD, and APRD with ET0 of 817(.)59 mm for the
   pear fruiting season. The seasonal transpiration accounted for 81(.)1\%,
   84(.)4\%, and 84(.)1\% of evapotranspiration for CFI, FPRD, and APRD
   respectively. For the CFI, FPRD, and APRD treatments, the seasonal
   average K-c were 1(.)058, 0(.)973, and 0(.)984 (with their maximum
   values of 1(.)326, 1(.)211, and 1(.)57) respectively similarly, the
   respective seasonal average K-cb were 0(.)858, 0(.)822, and 0(.)828
   (with maximum values of 1(.)059, 1(.)024, and 1(.)054). The
   relationships between K-cb, K-c, T/ET, and days after the season
   beginning were fitted to a fifth-order polynomial equation with higher
   coefficients of determination R-2. The maximum K-c and K-cb occurred in
   mid-January. The ratio T/ET varied from 0(.)736 to 0(.)909, 0(.)743 to
   0(.)947, and 0(.)741 to 0(.)925 in the pear fruiting season for CFI,
   FPRD, and APRD treatments respectively. Results suggested that APRD and
   FPRD can improve the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration, and
   reduce transpiration coefficient and crop coefficient. Such effects
   should help improve of water-use efficiency in pear orchards. Copyright

Abstract = {{Three main reservoirs were identified that contribute to the shallow
   subsurface flow regime of a valley drained by a fourth-order stream in
   Brittany (western France). (i) An upland flow that supplied a wetland
   area, mainly during the high-water period. It has high N-NO3- and
   average Cl- concentrations. (ii) A deep confined aquifer characterized
   by low nitrate and low chloride concentrations that supplied the
   floodplain via flow upwelling. (iii) An unconfined aquifer under the
   riparian zone with high Cl- and low N-NO3- concentrations where
   biological processes removed groundwater nitrate. This aquifer collected
   the upland flow and supplied a relict channel that controlled drainage
   from the whole riparian zone. Patterns of N-NO3- and Cl- concentrations
   along riparian transects, together with calculated high nitrate removal,
   indicate that removal occurred mainly at the hillslope-riparian zone
   interface (i.e. first few metres of wetland), whereas dilution occurred
   in lower parts of the transects, especially during low-water periods and
   at the beginning of recharge periods. Stream flow was modelled as a
   mixture of water from the three reservoirs. An estimation of these
   contributions revealed that the deep aquifer contribution to stream flow
   averaged 37\% throughout the study period, while the contribution of the
   unconfined reservoir below the riparian zone and hillslope flow was more
   variable (from ca 6 to 85\%) relative to rainfall events and the level
   of the riparian water table. At the entire riparian zone scale, NO3-
   removal (probably from denitrification) appeared most effective in
   winter, despite higher estimated upland NO3- fluxes entering the
   riparian zone during this period. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{To investigate the origin and behaviour of nitrate in alluvial aquifers
   adjacent to Nakdong River, Korea, we chose two representative sites
   (Wolha and Yongdang) having similar land-use characteristics but
   different geology. A total of 96 shallow groundwater samples were
   collected from irrigation and domestic wells tapping alluvial aquifers.
   About 63\% of the samples analysed had nitrate concentrations that
   exceeded the Korean drinking water limit (44(.)3 mg 1(-1) NO3-), and
   about 35\% of the samples had nitrate concentrations that exceeded the
   Korean groundwater quality standard for agricultural use (88(.)6 mg
   1(-1) NO3-). Based on nitrogen isotope analysis, two major nitrate
   sources were identified: synthetic fertilizer (about 4parts per
   thousand, delta(15)N) applied to farmland, and animal manure and sewage
   (15-20parts per thousand delta(15)N) originating from upstream
   residential areas. Shallow groundwater in the farmland generally had
   higher nitrate concentrations than those in residential areas, due to
   the influence of synthetic fertilizer. Nitrate concentrations at both
   study sites were highest near the water table and then progressively
   decreased with depth. Nitrate concentrations are also closely related to
   the geologic characteristics of the aquifer. In Yongdang,
   denitrification is important in regulating nitrate chemistry because of
   the availability of organic carbon from a(.) silt layer (about 20 m
   thick) below a thin, sandy surface aquifer. In Wolha, however,
   conservative mixing between farmland-recharged water and water coming
   from a village is suggested as the dominant process. Mixing ratios
   estimated based on the nitrate concentrations and the delta(15)N values
   indicate that water originating from the village affects the nitrate
   chemistry of the shallow groundwater underneath the farmland to a large
   extent. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Inland valleys with wet lowlands are an important water source for
   farming communities in the sub-humid zone of West Africa. An inland
   valley and surrounding contributing watershed area located in the
   sub-humid zone near M'be in central Cote d'Ivoire was instrumented to
   study surface runoff and base flow mechanisms. Four flumes at different
   distances down the main stream and more than 100 piezometers were
   installed. Measurements were taken during two rainfall seasons in 1998
   and 1999. Under initial wet conditions, a typical single-peak hydrograph
   was observed. Under low antecedent moisture conditions, however, runoff
   was characterized by a double-peaked hydrograph. The first peak, which
   occurred during the storm, was caused by rain falling on the saturated
   valley bottom. The second peak was delayed by minutes to hours from the
   first peak and consisted of rain flowing via the subsurface of the
   hydromorphic zone that surrounds the valley bottom. The duration of the
   delay was a function of the water table depth in the hydromorphic zone
   before the storm. The volume of the second peak constituted the largest
   portion of the stream flow. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A key parameter used in wetland hydrological and landform development
   models is hydraulic conductivity. Head recovery tests are often used to
   measure hydraulic conductivity, but the calculation techniques are
   usually confined to rigid soil theory. This is despite reports
   demonstrating the misapplication of rigid soil theory to non-rigid soils
   such as peals. Although values of hydraulic conductivity calculated
   using compressible techniques have been presented for fenland peals,
   these data have never, to the authors' knowledge, been compared with
   such calculations in other peat types. Head recovery tests (slug
   withdrawal) were performed on piezometers at depths ranging from 10 to
   80 cm from the surface on north Pennines blanket peals. Results were
   obtained using both rigid and compressible soil theories, thus allowing
   comparison of the two techniques. Compressible soil theory gives values
   for hydraulic conductivity that are typically a factor of five times
   less than rigid soil calculations. Hydraulic conductivity is often
   assumed to decrease with depth in upland peats, but at the study site in
   the northern Pennines it was not found to vary significantly with depth
   within the range of peat depths sampled. The variance within depth
   categories was not significantly different to the variance between depth
   categories showing that individual peat layers did not have
   characteristic hydraulic conductivity values. Thus, large lateral and
   vertical differences in hydraulic conductivity over short distances
   create problems for modelling but may help account for the high
   frequency of preferential flow pathways within what is otherwise a low
   matrix hydraulic conductivity peat. Hydraulic conductivity was found to
   vary significantly between sampling sites, demonstrating that hillslope-
   or catchment-scale variability may be more important than plot-scale
   variability. Values for compressibility of the peats are also reported.
   These generally decline with depth, and they also vary significantly
   between sampling sites. There are implications for the way in which
   measurements of hydraulic conductivity and other properties of blanket
   peat are interpreted, as the effects of environmental change in one part
   of a peat catchment may be very different to those in another. Copyright

Abstract = {{Hydrocarbon compounds in aquifers are generally known to show a
   retardation effect due to sorption onto the surfaces of solid particles.
   In this study, we investigated the effect of sorption on the transport
   of benzene in sandy aquifer materials by conducting batch and column
   tests for both sandy aquifer materials and sandy materials to which had
   been added 0(.)5\% powdered activated carbon. The batch test was
   conducted by equilibrating dry materials with benzene solutions of
   various initial concentrations, and by analysing the concentrations of
   benzene in the initial and equilibrated solutions using high-performance
   liquid chromatography (HPLC). The column test was performed to monitor
   the concentrations of effluent versus time, known as a breakthrough
   curve (BTC). We injected KCl and benzene solutions as tracers into the
   inlet boundary as two different types of square pulse and step, and
   monitored the effluent concentrations at the exit boundary under a
   steady-state condition using an electrical conductivity meter and HPLC.
   Simulation of benzene transport was performed using the
   convective-dispersive equation model with the distribution coefficients
   obtained from the batch test and the transport parameters of the
   conservative solute KCl from the column test. The observed BTCs of KCl
   and benzene for pulse injection showed that the arrival times of the
   peaks of both tracers coincided well, but the relative peak
   concentration of benzene was much lower than that of KCl. Comparison of
   the simulated and observed BTCs showed a great discrepancy for all cases
   of injection mode and material texture, indicating the absence of
   retardation effect. These results reveal that the predominant process
   affecting the benzene transport in the sandy aquifer materials is an
   irreversible sorption rather than retardation. This tentative conclusion
   was verified by simulation of benzene transport using an irreversible
   sorption parameter that led to a good agreement between the simulated
   and observed BTCs. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{An overview is given on the predictive quality of spatially distributed
   runoff and erosion models. A summary is given of the results of model
   comparison workshops organized by the Global Change and Terrestrial
   Ecosystems Focus 3 programme, as well as other results obtained by
   individual researchers. The results concur with the generally held
   viewpoint in the literature that the predictive quality of distributed
   models is moderately good for total discharge at the outlet, and not
   very good for net soil loss. This is only true if extensive calibration
   is done: uncalibrated results are generally bad. The more simple lumped
   models seem to perform equally well as the more complex distributed
   models, although the latter produce more detailed spatially distributed
   results that can aid the researcher. All these results are outlet based:
   models are tested on lumped discharge and soil loss or on hydrographs
   and sedigraphs. Surprisingly few tests have been done on the comparison
   of simulated and modelled erosion patterns, although this may arguably
   be just as important in the sense of designing anti-erosion measures and
   determining source and sink areas. Two studies are shown in which the
   spatial performance of the erosion model LISEM (Limburg soil erosion
   model) is analysed. It seems that: (i) the model is very sensitive to
   the resolution (grid cell size); (ii) the spatial pattern prediction is
   not very good; (iii) the performance becomes better when the results are
   resampled to a lower resolution and (iv) the results are improved when
   certain processes in the model (in this case gully incision) are
   restricted to so called `critical areas', selected from the digital
   elevation model with simple rules.
   The difficulties associated with calibrating and validating spatially
   distributed soil erosion models are, to a large extent, due to the large
   spatial and temporal variability of soil erosion phenomena and the
   uncertainty associated with the input parameter values used in models to
   predict these processes. They will, therefore, not be solved by
   constructing even more complete, and therefore more complex, models.
   However, the situation may be improved by using more spatial information
   for model calibration and validation rather than output data only and by
   using `optimal' models, describing only the dominant processes operating
   in a given landscape. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Spatially distributed models of soil erosion and sediment delivery have
   been increasingly used in studies of catchment sediment dynamics in
   recent years. Distributed models permit both the spatial heterogeneity
   of catchment land use, soil properties and topography, and the spatial
   interaction of soil erosion and sediment transport processes to be
   represented and can, therefore, provide spatially distributed
   predictions of soil redistribution rates for complex three-dimensional
   terrain. However, validation of such distributed models has been
   severely hampered by the lack of information on the spatial distribution
   of sediment mobilization and deposition within catchments, and has
   commonly been restricted to comparison of predicted and measured
   sediment outputs from catchments. The use of the fallout radionuclide
   Cs-137 for documenting soil redistribution affords a means of assembling
   distributed information on medium-term rates and patterns of soil
   redistribution within a catchment which can be used for model testing.
   The present study uses the Cs-137 technique to investigate erosion and
   sediment delivery processes within a cultivated field in Devon, UK, and
   the results have been used to test four spatially distributed soil
   erosion and sediment delivery models, namely the widely used AGNPS and
   ANSWERS models, a topography-based sediment delivery model, and a
   topography-driven soil erosion model. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley

Abstract = {{As stated by many authors in the recent past, soil erosion is one of the
   major environmental problems in southern Africa and it will become even
   more severe in the future due to population growth and potential
   climatic changes. This study concerns the detection of different land
   degradation stages in semi-arid grassland areas in the upper
   Mbuluzi-river catchment (Kingdom of Swaziland). It has been carried out
   within the framework of an interdisciplinary EU-funded project aimed at
   developing an integrated water resources management system (IWRMS) for
   water resources analyses and prognostic scenario planning in semi-arid
   catchments of Southern Africa (Flugel et al., 2001 URL:
   http://www.iwrms.uni-jena.de/download/Eu-reports/report\_final.pdf).
   Within this more general framework, particular attention was focused on
   the determination of high-resolution morphometric parameters for
   detailed erosion process studies, as well as on the derivation of
   relationships between vegetation cover and bare soil. The latter has
   subsequently been used to delineate the vegetation cover density and
   C-factor values for erosion models such as the revised universal soil
   loss equation. The examples from Southern Africa show that the methods
   applied are able to identify areas affected by different types of
   erosion. Furthermore, it is possible to estimate the parameters for a
   subsequent erosion modelling. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Water resources management is an important issue in southern African
   countries. With respect to water quality problems, the understanding of
   the dynamics of integrated soil erosion processes in river basins is of
   crucial importance. This study is on the delineation of response units
   (RUs) in the Mkomazi River catchment (KwaZulu/Natal; South Africa). It
   was carried out within the framework of an interdisciplinary EU-funded
   project aimed at developing an integrated water resources management
   system for water resources analyses and prognostic scenario planning in
   semi-arid catchments of southern Africa. Within this more general
   framework, particular attention was focused on the identification of
   sediment source areas. For this purpose, the RUs concept was applied to
   delineate erosion RUs (ERUs). The ERUs were subsequently used to
   identify heterogeneously distributed areas within a river catchment
   characterized by specific hydrological and erosion dynamics and
   features. Therefore, they can be applied as modelling entities in
   physically based hydrological and erosion models. Spatially distributed
   input data from the catchment were derived by remote sensing techniques
   and geographical information systems analyses. Taking into account the
   high amount of sediments produced by gully erosion, not considered in
   USLE-type models, special attention was focused on gully erosion using a
   dynamic gully erosion model. The example from southern Africa shows that
   the methods applied are able to identify areas affected by gully
   erosion. Furthermore, it was possible to estimate the entire amount of
   soil loss, including gully erosion. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{The Chernobyl accident contaminated vast areas of Europe with
   radiocaesium (Cs-137) in 1986. To evaluate long-term and event-based
   redistribution of Chernobyl-derived Cs-137 at the catchment scale, two
   geographical information system embedded models have been developed. The
   first model simulates Cs-137 redistribution using a monthly time step
   based on a long-term soil erosion model. The second model simulates
   lateral radiocaesium transport at the event scale based on the existing
   Limburg soil erosion model. This model accounts for surface runoff, soil
   erosion and deposition, and radiocaesium exchange between the topsoil
   layer, runoff water, and suspended sediment. Both models have been
   tested and applied to the Mochovce catchment, western Slovakia. The
   spatial distribution of Cs-137 activity in soil simulated by the
   long-term model was used as input for the event-based model to assess
   the changes in Cs-137 transport during rainfall events between 1986 and
   2002. Soil erosion events in the first months after initial fallout
   input before ploughing caused a considerable decline in the Cs-137 soil
   inventories, which were estimated at 8.9\% of the total initial
   inventory. The majority of Cs-137 transport during rainfall events
   occurs in particulate form. Both the absolute amounts of particulate
   Cs-137 transport and the fraction of particulate Cs-137 transport were
   shown to be positively related to suspended sediment transport. Between
   1986 and 2002, dissolved (CS)-C-137 transport has declined by a factor
   of about 26, which can be largely attributed to the increased sorption
   to sediment particles. Particulate (CS)-C-137 transport has declined by
   a factor of about two, which can be largely attributed to the decrease
   in soil Cs-137. The (CS)-C-137 inventories in soil have decreased by a
   factor between three and four at the steep hillslopes, but have remained
   at about the same level as the initial fallout input at the valley
   bottoms. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{There is significant evidence of frequent and rapid erosion and fast
   rates of bank line retreat along the river Brahmaputra-Jamuna within
   Bangladesh. This study is aimed at quantifying the actual rates of bank
   erosion along the river based on time series analysis of satellite
   images and historical maps. Analysis shows that the erosion rates in the
   Brahmaputra-Jamuna River were 160 m year(-1) between 1973 and 1992,
   indicating the severity of erosion hazard along the river. This study
   also revealed the fact that the river has migrated westwards at an
   average movement rate of 50 m year(-1) during the period of 1830-1992.
   In 1830, the river had an average width of 6.2 km, but by 1992 the
   average width had increased to 10.6 km. The channel has widened at an
   average rate of 27 m year(-1) during 1830-1914. After that, it has
   widened at an average rate of 65 m year(-1). The average width of the
   river has increased about 130 m year(-1) since 1973. Analysis of the
   Landsat images shows that, over the whole river, riverine islands most
   often persist from 1 to 7 years, but 30\% have lasted for 14 years or
   more. Accretion has taken place in the middle and lower reaches north of
   the east bank and in the extreme north of the west bank between 1973 and
   1992. The rate of accretion is not comparable with the rate of bank
   erosion of the Brahmaputra-Jamuna River. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Most economic developments may have been at the expense of soil
   conservation. Soil erosion results in impacts on reservoir sediment,
   crop yield, and water quality. This study introduces the procedure of
   using a geographical information system for investigating reservoir
   sediments and soil erosion of the corresponding watershed. First, the
   bathymetric surface of a reservoir is surveyed using two real-time
   kinematic global position systems and a sonar-based depth gauge. Using
   the on-board computer, receivers, and sonar, bathymetric readings are
   recorded three times a second to establish actual coordinates and depth
   measurements. Data are then converted using a digital terrain model to
   obtain the current image bathymetric surface. The image of original
   bathymetric surfaces when constructed can be obtained by digitizing the
   existing map. The subtraction of these two images is used to estimate
   the amount of sediment deposits. Next, parameters of rainfall-runoff
   erosivity factor, soil erodibility factor, slope length factor, slope
   steepness factor, cover-management factor, and support practice factor
   are evaluated for each grid of the corresponding watershed. The average
   annual soil loss from each grid is estimated by the revised universal
   soil loss equation to obtain the total amount of the soil loss for the
   watershed. Using the example of Charles Mill Lake, Ohio, USA, the
   estimated average amount of sediment deposits in the lake was about 2.44
   x 10(4) m(3) year(-1). On the other hand, the estimated soil erosion
   from the corresponding watershed was about 4.22 x 10(8) kg year(-1) or
   1.56 x 10(5) m(3) year(-1). Hence, it can be concluded that about 15.6\%
   of the soils eroded from the watershed have been deposited in the lake.

Abstract = {{The difficulties involved in calibration of physically based erosion
   models have been partly attributable to the lack of robust optimization
   tools. This paper presents the essential concepts and application to
   optimize channel and plane parameters in an erosion model, with a global
   optimization method known as the SCE-UA (Duan et al., 1992. Water
   Resources Research 28(4): 1015-1031), which has recently shown promise
   as an effective and efficient optimization method for calibrating
   watershed models. It is based on the simplex method, and in order to
   improve its efficiency by making the simplex expand in a direction of
   more favourable conditions, or contract if a move was taken in a
   direction of less favourable conditions, new evolution steps have been
   introduced. The physically based erosion model that was chosen is called
   WESP (watershed erosion simulation program), developed by Lopes and Lane
   (1988. In Sediment Budgets, Bordas MP, Walling DE (eds). IAHS
   Publication no. 174. IAHS: Wallingford). The optimization technique was
   tested with the field data collected in an experimental watershed
   located in a semi-arid region of Brazil. On the basis of these results,
   the recommended erosion parameter values for a semi-arid region are
   given, which could serve as an initial estimate for other similar areas.

Abstract = {{Practical decision making in spatially distributed environmental
   assessment and management is increasingly based on environmental process
   models linked to geographical information systems. Powerful personal
   computers and Internet-accessible assessment tools are providing much
   greater public access to, and use of, environmental models and
   geo-spatial data. However traditional process models, such as the water
   erosion prediction project (WEPP), were not typically developed with a
   flexible graphical user interface (GUI) for applications across a wide
   range of spatial and temporal scales, utilizing readily available
   geo-spatial data of highly variable precision and accuracy, and
   communicating with a diverse spectrum of users with different levels of
   expertise. As the development of the geo-spatial interface for WEPP
   (GeoWEPP) demonstrates, the GUI plays a key role in facilitating
   effective communication between the tool developer and user about data
   and model scales. The GeoWEPP approach illustrates that it is critical
   to develop a scientific and functional framework for the design,
   implementation, and use of such geo-spatial model assessment tools. The
   way that GeoWEPP was developed and implemented suggests a framework and
   scaling theory leading to a practical approach for developing
   geo-spatial interfaces for process models. GeoWEPP accounts for
   fundamental water erosion processes, model, and users needs, but most
   important it also matches realistic data availability and environmental
   settings by enabling even non-GIS-literate users to assemble the
   available geo-spatial data quickly to start soil and water conservation
   planning. In general, it is potential users' spatial and temporal scales
   of interest, and scales of readily available data, that should drive
   model design or selection, as opposed to using or designing the most
   sophisticated process model as the starting point and then determining
   data needs and result scales. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The BASINS geographic information system hydrologic toolkit was designed
   to compute total maximum daily loads, which are often derived by
   combining water quantity estimates with pollutant concentration
   estimates. In this paper the BASINS toolkit PLOAD and WinHSPF sub-models
   are briefly described, and then a 0.45 km(2) headwater watershed in the
   New York Croton River area is used for a case study illustrating a full
   WinHSPF implementation. The goal of the Croton study was to determine
   the sensitivity of WinHSPF hydrographs to changes in land cover map
   inputs. This scenario occurs when scaling the WinHSPF model from the
   smaller 0.45 km(2) watershed to the larger 1000 km(2) management basin
   of the entire Croton area. Methods used to test model sensitivity
   include first calibrating the WinHSPF hydrograph using
   research-monitored precipitation and discharge data together with high
   spatial resolution and accuracy land cover data of impervious and
   pervious areas, and then swapping three separate land cover files, known
   as GIRAS, MRLC, and DOQQ data, into the calibrated model. Research
   results indicated that the WinHSPF land cover swapping had peak flow
   sensitivity in December 2001 hydrographs between 35\% underestimation
   and 20\% overestimation, and that errors in land-cover-derived runoff
   ratios for storm totals and peak flows tracked with the land cover data
   estimates of impervious area. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The process of aquifer recharge by flood events in an and region was
   investigated as applied to the Hazeva Formation (the Karkom graben, the
   Wadi Paran watershed, Israel). The hydrological model was established as
   a complex system, with due regard for groundwater and transmission
   losses of surface runoff. It was based on a previously outlined
   hydrogeological model of the Karkom graben and a model of transmission
   losses in and watercourses under conditions of data deficiency.
   Proceeding from calculation of groundwater balances, the contribution of
   surface runoff as a decisive balance component was confirmed. The main
   characteristics of aquifer regimes, such as changes in storage volume
   and groundwater level, as well as lateral flow, were all found to be
   dependent upon the net extraction rate, i.e. pumpage discounting
   replenishment by flood events. Analysis and physical interpretation of
   model parameters enabled assessment of the influence of groundwater
   extraction on aquifer recharge. This became apparent as increasing
   absorption capacity and recharge availability of the aquifer as a result
   of the groundwater abstraction. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

   the course of the developing an earlier hydrological model for the

   of runoff and enhancement of transmission losses from flood events in

Abstract = {{This article presents results from an investigation of the hydraulic
   characteristics of overbank flows on topographically-complex natural
   river floodplains. A two-dimensional hydraulic model that solves the
   depth-averaged shallow water form of the Navier-Stokes equations is used
   to simulate an overbank flow event within a multiple channel reach of
   the River Culm, Devon, UK. Parameterization of channel and floodplain
   roughness by the model is evaluated using monitored records of main
   channel water level and point measurements of floodplain flow depth and
   unit discharge. Modelled inundation extents and sequences are assessed
   using maps of actual inundation patterns obtained using a Global
   Positioning System, observational evidence and ground photographs.
   Simulation results suggest a two-phase model of flooding at the site,
   which seems likely to be representative of natural floodplains in
   general. Comparison of these results with previous research demonstrates
   the complexity of overbank flows on natural river floodplains and
   highlights the limitations of laboratory flumes as an analogue for these
   environments. Despite this complexity, frequency distributions of
   simulated depth, velocity and unit discharge data closely follow a
   simple gamma distribution model, and are described by a shape parameter
   (alpha) that exhibits clear systematic trends with changing discharge
   and floodplain roughness. Such statistical approaches have the potential
   to provide the basis for computationally efficient flood routing and
   overbank sedimentation models. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{During a 16 day period with pronounced snowmelt via surface runoff, high
   water concentrations (usually 0.4-0.5 mg 1(-1)) of dissolved
   molybdate-reactive phosphorus (MRP) were detected in surface runoff
   water from a clay soil of illite type. Other phosphorus fractions
   defined were: phosphorus in particles with a higher settling coefficient
   than 80000 S (SPP); colloidal phosphorus caught on filters with a pore
   size of 0.2 pm but with a smaller settling coefficient (CPP); and
   dissolved phosphorus not reacting with molybdate (DUP). The order of
   concentrations was MRP > SPP > CPP > DUP. Nearly identical amounts of
   MRP, CPP, and DUP (in total 0.3 kg ha(-1)) were lost from a grass-clover
   ley and a ploughed soil. However, more of the heavier
   phosphorus-containing material was lost from the ploughed area. In
   drainpipe water, CPP was the largest fraction (28\%), and in stream
   water from mixed arable/forest land, MRP dominated (33\%). Loss on
   ignition of the settling material slowly decreased from 10 to 8\% (dry
   weight) during the snowmelt period. Total phosphorus concentrations in
   the material followed the runoff pattern, with slightly higher
   phosphorus concentrations during fast runoff. The large amounts of
   readily dissolved or colloidal-bound phosphorus (70-80\%) transported
   from this clay soil during snowmelt are discussed with regard to the use
   of grass buffer strips as a measure against phosphorus losses from
   arable land. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Geochemically based hydrograph separation techniques were used in a
   preliminary assessment to infer how runoff processes change with
   landscape characteristics and spatial scale (1-233 km(2)) within a
   mesoscale catchment in upland Scotland. A two-component end-member
   mixing analysis (EMMA) used Gran alkalinity as an assumed conservative
   tracer. Analysis indicated that, at all scales investigated, acidic
   overland flow and shallow subsurface storm flows from the peaty soils
   covering the catchment headwaters dominated storm runoff generation. The
   estimated groundwater contribution to annual runoff varied from 30\% in
   the smallest (ca 1 km(2)) peat-dominated headwater catchment with
   limited groundwater storage, to >60\% in larger catchments (>30 km(2))
   with greater coverage of more freely draining soils and more extensive
   aquifers in alluvium and other drift. This simple approach offers a
   useful, integrated conceptualization of the hydrological functioning in
   a mesoscale catchment, which can be tested and further refined by
   focused modelling and process-based research. However, even as it
   stands, the simple conceptualization of system behaviour will have
   significant utility as a tool for communicating hydrological issues in a
   range of planning and management decisions. Copyright (C) 2002 John

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to measure the effects of invertebrates
   on the physical characteristics and microbial processes in hyporheic
   sediments. We investigated the impacts of an assemblage of three taxa
   (asellids, chironomid larvae, and tubificid worms) on sediment
   distribution, water fluxes, sediment organic carbon, biofilm (attached
   bacteria) characteristics, and O-2, dissolved organic carbon NO3-, NO2-,
   and NH4+ concentrations in slow filtration sand-gravel columns. The
   results showed that invertebrates clearly modified the distribution of
   particles in the sediment column, probably because of the structures
   (tubes, macropores, and faecal pellets) produced by the three taxa in
   the sediment. Our assessment of water fluxes indicated that invertebrate
   activities led to an increase in the porosity of the sediment columns.
   In addition, aerobic (O-2 consumption) and anaerobic (denitrification
   and fermentative decomposition of organic matter) microbial processes
   occurring in the sediment were stimulated in the presence of
   invertebrates. Finally,, the present study demonstrates that
   invertebrates can act as ecosystem engineers in heterogeneous sediments
   that are under the influence of an advective flux of water. The solute
   residence time increased in columns containing the faunal assemblage.
   Micro-organisms used more dissolved organic matter and nutrients in the
   presence of invertebrates because invertebrate activities increased the
   contact between the biofilm and water. We conclude that engineering by
   invertebrates in natural conditions modifies characteristics of the
   hyporheic zone and thereby enhances both the porosity of the sediment
   and the solute transport across the benthic interface. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Our understanding of Lake Vostok, the huge subglacial lake beneath the
   East Antarctic Ice Sheet, has improved recently through the
   identification of key physical and chemical interactions between the ice
   sheet and the lake. The north of the lake, where the overlying ice sheet
   is thickest, is characterized by subglacial melting, whereas freezing of
   lake water occurs in the south, resulting in similar to210 m of ice
   accretion to the underside of the ice sheet. The accreted ice contains
   lower concentrations of the impurities normally found in glacier ice,
   suggesting a net transfer of material from meltwater into the lake. The
   small numbers of microbes found so far within the accreted ice have DNA
   profiles similar to those of contemporary surface microbes.
   Microbiologists expect, however, that Lake Vostok, and other subglacial
   lakes, will harbour unique species, particularly within the deeper
   waters and associated sediments. The extreme environments of subglacial
   lakes are characterized by high pressures, low temperatures, permanent
   darkness, limited nutrient availability, and oxygen concentrations that
   are derived from the ice that provides the meltwater. Copyright (C) 2002

Title = {{Characterization of lake water and ground water movement in the littoral
   zone of Williams Lake, a closed-basin lake in north central Minnesota}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Williams Lake, Minnesota is a closed-basin lake that is a flow-through
   system with respect to ground water. Ground-water input represents half
   of the annual water input and most of the chemical input to the lake.
   Chemical budgets indicate that the lake is a sink for calcium, yet
   surficial sediments contain little calcium carbonate. Sediment
   pore-water samplers (peepers) were used to characterize solute fluxes at
   the lake-water-ground-water interface in the littoral zone and resolve
   the apparent disparity between the chemical budget and sediment data.
   Pore-water depth profiles of the stable isotopes delta(18)O and
   delta(2)H were non-linear where ground water seeped into the lake, with
   a sharp transition from lake-water values to ground-water values in the
   top 10 cm of sediment. These data indicate that advective inflow to the
   lake is the primary mechanism for solute flux from ground water. Linear
   interstitial velocities determined from delta(2)H profiles (316 to 528
   cm/yr) were consistent with velocities determined independently from
   water budget data and sediment porosity (366 cm/yr). Stable isotope
   profiles were generally linear where water flowed out of the lake into
   ground water. However, calcium profiles were not linear in the same area
   and varied in response to input of calcium carbonate from the littoral
   zone and subsequent dissolution. The comparison of pore-water calcium
   profiles to pore-water stable isotope profiles indicate calcium is not
   conservative. Based on the previous understanding that 40-50 \% of the
   calcium in Williams Lake is retained, the pore-water profiles indicate
   aquatic plants in the littoral zone are recycling the retained portion
   of calcium. The difference between the pore-water depth profiles of
   calcium and delta(18)O and delta(2)H demonstrate the importance of using
   stable isotopes to evaluate flow direction and source through the
   lake-water-ground-water interface and evaluate mechanisms controlling
   the chemical balance of lakes. Published in 2003 by John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{A rainstorm that caused a severe flash flood on the piedmont plain at

   kinematic wave. The spatial distribution of rainfall shows a topographic
   control. The greatest rainfall depth, duration, and intensity occurred
   at the higher elevation mountain slopes and decreased with decreasing
   elevation from the alluvial fans to the piedmont plain. The alluvial
   fan-piedmont plain system is modelled by coupling divergent and
   rectangular overland flow planes. Explicit finite difference
   approximations, hybridized with the analytical method of
   characteristics, are made to the kinematic wave equations to account for
   the spatial and temporal distribution of the rainfall and variable
   boundary conditions. Simulation results indicate that sheet-flow
   floodwater elevations rise (1) in a nonlinear fashion from the apex to
   toe positions of the alluvial fans, and (2) near linearly from the toe
   positions of the alluvial fans onto the piedmont plains with the
   formation of kinematic shocks near the middle to the upstream end of the
   plane at times between the initiation of the rainstorm and the time of
   concentration of the plane. Thus, the maximum flooding occurs at the
   middle or upstream sections of the piedmont plains regardless of the
   pattern of space-time variability of rainfall. These results are in
   agreement with observed geomorphologic features suggesting that piedmont
   plains are naturally flood-prone areas. This case study demonstrates
   that flood hazards on piedmont plains can exceed those on alluvial fans.
   The models presented in this study suggest that the flood hazard zones
   on coupled alluvial fan-piedmont plain landforms should be delineated
   transverse to the flow directions, as opposed to the flood hazard zones
   with boundaries in the longitudinal direction of the axis of an alluvial
   fan. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Soil loss continues to threaten Java's predominantly bench-terraced
   volcanic uplands. Sediment transport processes on back-sloping terraces
   with well-aggregated clay-rich oxisols in West Java were studied using
   two different techniques. Splash on bare, cropped, or mulched
   sub-horizontal (2-3degrees) terrace beds was studied using splash cups
   of different sizes, whereas transport of sediment on the predominantly
   bare and steep (30-40degrees) terrace risers was measured using a novel
   device combining a Gerlach-type trough with a splash box to enable the
   separate measurement of transport by wash and splash processes.
   Measurements were made during two consecutive rainy seasons. The results
   were interpreted using a recently developed splash distribution theory
   and related to effective rainfall erosive energy. Splash
   transportability (i.e. transport per unit contour length and unit
   erosive energy) on the terrace risers was more than an order of
   magnitude greater than on bare terrace beds (0.39-0.57 versus
   0.013-0.016 g m J(-1)). This was caused primarily by a greater average
   splash distance on the short, steep risers (> 11 cm versus c. 1 cm on
   the beds). Splashed amounts were reduced by the gradual formation of a
   protective `pavement' of coarser aggregates, in particular on the
   terrace beds. Soil aggregate size exhibited an inverse relationship with
   detachability (i.e. detachment per unit area and unit erosive energy)
   and average splash length, and therefore also with transportability, as
   did the degree of canopy and mulch cover. On the terrace risers,
   splash-creep and gravitational processes transported an additional
   6-50\% of measured rain splash, whereas transport by wash played a
   marginal role. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we explore the optimum assimilation of high-resolution
   data into numerical models using the example of topographic data
   provision for flood inundation simulation. First, we explore problems
   with current assimilation methods in which numerical grids are generated
   independent of topography. These include possible loss of significant
   length scales of topographic information, poor representation of the
   original surface and data redundancy. These are resolved through the
   development of a processing chain consisting of: (i) assessment of
   significant length scales of variation in the input data sets; (ii)
   determination of significant points within the data set; (iii)
   translation of these into a conforming model discretization that
   preserves solution quality for a given numerical solver; and (iv)
   incorporation of otherwise redundant sub-grid data into the model in a
   computationally efficient manner. This processing chain is used to
   develop an optimal finite element discretization for a 12 km reach of
   the River Stour in Dorset, UK, for which a high-resolution topographic
   data set derived from airborne laser altimetry (LiDAR) was available.
   For this reach, three simulations of a 1 in 4 year flood event were
   conducted: a control simulation with a mesh developed independent of
   topography, a simulation with a topographically optimum mesh, and a
   further simulation with the topographically optimum mesh incorporating
   the sub-grid topographic data within a correction algorithm for dynamic
   wetting and drying in fixed grid models. The topographically optimum
   model is shown to represent better the `raw' topographic data set and
   that differences between this surface and the control are hydraulically
   significant. Incorporation of sub-grid topographic data has a less
   marked impact than getting the explicit hydraulic calculation correct,
   but still leads to important differences in model behaviour. The paper
   highlights the need for better validation data capable of discriminating
   between these competing approaches and begins to indicate what the
   characteristics of such a data set should be. More generally, the
   techniques developed here should prove useful for any data set where the
   resolution exceeds that of the model in which it is to be used.

Abstract = {{At the St Denis National Wildlife Area in the prairie region of southern
   Saskatchewan, Canada, water levels in wetlands have been monitored since
   1968. In 1980 and 1983 a total of about one-third of the 4 km(2) area
   was converted from cultivation to an undisturbed cover of brome grass. A
   few years after this conversion all the wetlands within the area of
   grass dried out; they have remained dry since, whereas wetlands in
   adjacent cultivated lands have held water as before. Field measurements
   show that introduction of undisturbed grass reduces water input to the
   wetlands mainly through a combination of efficient snow trapping and
   enhanced infiltration into frozen soil. In winter, the tall brome grass
   traps most of the snowfall, whereas in the cultivated fields more wind
   transport of snow occurs, especially for short stubble and fallow
   fields. Single-ring infiltration tests were conducted during snowmelt,
   while the soil was still frozen, and again in summer. The infiltrability
   of the frozen soil in the grassland is high enough to absorb most or all
   of the snowmelt, whereas in the cultivated fields the infiltration into
   the frozen soil is limited and significant runoff occurs. In summer, the
   infiltrability increases for the cultivated fields, but the grassland
   retains a much higher infiltrability than the cultivated land. The
   development of enhanced infiltrability takes several years after the
   conversion from cultivation to grass, and is likely due to the gradual
   development of macropores, such as root holes, desiccation cracks, and
   animal burrows. Copyright 2002 Crown in the right of Canada. Published

Title = {{Hydraulic modelling of fish habitat in urban rivers during high flows}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},

Abstract = {{In urban rivers, flow regime and channel morphology are the drivers of
   physical habitat quality for aquatic species. Peak discharges are
   increased at high flows as a result of impermeable catchments and
   channel engineering for flood protection schemes. Hazardous conditions
   and flashy hydrographs mean that measurement of velocities at high flows
   is a difficult task. This research uses a three-dimensional
   computational fluid dynamics (3D-CFD) model to simulate hydraulic
   patterns in two urban river channels. A 3D-CFD code, called SSIIM, was
   used to simulate hydraulic conditions in two engineered river reaches of
   the River Tame, Birmingham, UK. These two sites represent channels with
   different levels of engineering. Models were calibrated and tested using
   field measurements. Results show that modelled water surface levels and
   velocity profiles are well simulated. Calibrated roughness heights are
   compared with those derived from field measurement of sediment size.
   Numerical experiments are used to assess the relationship between grid
   resolution in the vertical dimension and the form of the modelled
   velocity profiles. Biologists have used laboratory experiments to
   determine maximum sustainable swimming speeds (MSSS) of fish, often in
   order to assess what level of a particular pollutant may be tolerable.
   In this work, simulations of high-flow hydraulic patterns are used to
   compare velocity patterns with fish MSSS. Results show that when the
   water levels rise to fill the, first channel of the two-stage channels
   at the sites, which occurred 16 times in 2000, MSSS are surpassed in the
   majority of available habitat, suggesting that excessive velocities at
   high flows are one factor that limits fish habitat. A comparison between
   the two reaches shows that there is less available habitat in the more
   modified reach. Conclusions suggest that an approach that integrates
   water quality issues and physical channel characteristics must be taken
   in river rehabilitation schemes, as improvements to water quality alone
   may not be sufficient to improve habitat quality to the desired level.

Abstract = {{Spatial and temporal variability in ground water-surface water
   interactions in the hyporheic zone of a salmonid spawning stream was
   investigated. Four locations in a 150-m reach of the stream were studied
   using hydrometric and hydrochemical tracing techniques. A high degree of
   hydrological connectivity between the riparian hillslope and the stream
   channel was indicated at two locations, where hydrochemical changes and
   hydraulic gradients indicated that the hyporheic zone was dominated by
   upwelling ground water. The chemistry of ground water reflected
   relatively long residence times and reducing conditions with high levels
   of alkalinity and conductivity, low dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrate.
   At the other locations, connectivity was less evident and, at most
   times, the hyporheic zone was dominated by downwelling stream water
   characterized by high DO, low alkalinity and conductivity. Substantial
   variability in hyporheic chemistry was evident at fine (<10 m) spatial
   scales and changed rapidly over the course of hydrological events. The
   nature of the hydrochemical response varied among locations depending on
   the strength of local ground water influence. It is suggested that
   greater emphasis on spatial and temporal heterogeneity in ground
   water-surface water interactions in the hyporheic zone is necessary for
   a consideration of hydrochemical effects on many aspects of stream
   ecology. For example, the survival of salmonid eggs in hyporheic gravels
   varied considerably among the locations studied and was shown to be
   associated with variation in interstitial chemistry. River restoration
   schemes and watershed management strategies based only on the surface
   expression of catchment characteristics risk excluding consideration of
   potentially critical subsurface processes. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Snow surface roughness is an important variable in the study of
   surface-atmosphere exchanges, including the investigation of snow melt
   at several scales, meltwater production and meltwater flux, wind
   transport and erosion in winter. In this paper the morphogenesis of the
   snow surface in winter and in summer is investigated both
   phenomenologically and quantitatively. For the first time, snow surface
   roughness and microtopography is measured spatially, using the Glacier
   Roughness Sensor (GRS), an instrument developed especially for this
   purpose. Data are analysed by application of geostatistical
   characterization and classification methods. Parameters that are useful
   as snow surface descriptors are defined and extracted from vario
   functions of first and second order, which are calculated for
   snow-surface-roughness data.
   As a result of the geostatistical analysis, characteristics of
   morphogenetic processes of the winter and summer snow surface are
   derived. Characteristic parameters are given for suncups (summer) and
   sastrugi (winter) and their development stages, as well as quantitative
   discriminators between these forms, which may facilitate automation of
   snow surface classification. As an application, the interaction of
   environmentally induced processes and self-organizational processes is
   analysed. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Dimensionless numbers, including the Reynolds number Re, the wave number
   sigma, the Froude number F, the quasi-shallow wave number sigma(v), the
   kinematic wave number K, Vedernikov number V, and others, are frequently
   encountered in analytical and numerical analyses of waves occurring in
   frictional and frictionless channels. Depending on their derivation,
   these numbers can be classified into physical, geometrical, derived,
   input-based numbers, and their combinations. It can be shown that (a)
   the waves under friction are primarily governed by R-e, pointing to
   friction laws and, consequently, the rating exponent; (b) the wave
   number characterizes the wave type for a given R-e; (c) the numbers
   describing the reference state of flow do not have the efficacy of
   characterizing a wave type on its own, e.g. F-o that describes the
   significance of inertial forces in wave motion; (d) coupling of F-o with
   sigma produces a more efficacious number K; (e) Vedernikov number V, a
   combination of the rating exponent or, in turn, Re and Fo, is more
   powerful than either R-e or F-o; and (f) the numbers emanating from
   analytical solutions describe the wave types, whereas those emanating
   from numerical analyses usually prescribe the limits for stable
   solutions, such as Courant number C-r and cell Reynolds number D. The
   significance of these numbers is described using the case of evolution
   and propagation of a dam-break flood wave. Furthermore, it is shown that
   as sigma forms the basic unit of shallow wave description, then
   quasi-shallow waves are described by the quasi-shallow wave number
   sigma(v) the wave length parameter normalized by the normal depth of
   flow. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the concern of accuracy in peak estimation by the
   artificial neural network (ANN) river flow models is discussed and a
   suitable statistical procedure to get better estimates from these models
   is presented. The possible cause for underestimation of peak flow values
   has been attributed to the local variations in the function being mapped
   due to varying skewness in the data series, and theoretical
   considerations of the network functioning confirm this. It is envisaged
   that an appropriate data transformation will reduce the local variations
   in the function being mapped, and thus any ANN model built on the
   transformed series should perform better. This heuristic is illustrated
   and confirmed by many case studies and the results suggest that the
   model performance is significantly improved by data transformation. The
   model built on transformed data outperforms the model built on raw data
   in terms of various statistical performance indices. The peak estimates
   are improved significantly by data transformation. Copyright (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model is applied to the
   Redfish Creek catchment to investigate the suitability of this model for
   simulation of forested mountainous watersheds in interior British
   Columbia and other high-latitude and high-altitude areas. On-site
   meteorological data and GIS information on terrain parameters, forest
   cover, and soil cover are used to specify model input. A stepwise
   approach is taken in calibrating the model, in which snow accumulation
   and melt parameters for clear-cut and forested areas were optimized
   independent of runoff production parameters. The calibrated model
   performs well in reproducing year-to-year variability in the Outflow
   hydrograph, including peak flows. In the subsequent model performance
   evaluation for simulation of catchment processes, emphasis is put on
   elevation and temporal differences in snow accumulation and melt,
   spatial patterns of snowline retreat, water table depth, and internal
   runoff generation, using internal catchment data as much as possible.
   Although the overall model performance based on these criteria is found
   to be good, some issues regarding the Simulation of internal catchment
   processes remain. These issues are related to the distribution of
   meteorological variables over the catchment and a lack of information on
   spatial variability in soil properties and soil saturation patterns.
   Present data limitations for testing internal model accuracy serve to
   guide future data collection at Redfish Creek. This study also
   illustrates the L challenges that need to be overcome before distributed
   physically based hydrologic models can be used for simulating catchments
   with fewer data resources. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Soil moisture patterns were recorded for six different land uses,
   including oak forest, matorral scrub, olives, and a cultivated field, in
   central Spain during 1998-99. Volumetric water content was determined
   using time domain reflectometry at more than 140 sites in each,
   extending across a range of topographic units. Soil moisture content was
   a function of land use, with the oak forest being wetter than either the
   matorral shrubby area or the cultivated site. The spatial patterns for a
   wet period were kriged and are presented as interpolated contour plots.
   Geo-statistical analysis confirmed that the patterns were highly
   heterogeneous, as the variograms showed it pure nugget for each land
   use, except for the two olive sites, where some spatial structure could
   be observed. During the investigation the soils were in the dry state
   and the soil moisture distribution was controlled by `local' Factors; it
   was not possible to determine which environmental factor had the most
   influence. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen dynamics were investigated in tandem with groundwater
   monitoring in a temperate forest catchment in Japan, to determine the
   effect of the partial dieback of dominant tree stands on nutrient
   cycling and streamwater chemistry, especially temporal and spatial
   changes in the NO3- concentrations in soil and ground water. Decreased
   nitrogen uptake by roots and increased nitrogen supply from the litter
   fall that occurred with the 1992-94 pine dieback caused by pine-wilt
   disease brought on a threefold increase in nitrate concentrations in
   streamwater and subsurface groundwater. It was found that, from 1992 to
   1996, seasonal peaks occurred in the stream NO3- concentrations during
   the rainy season (July to August). This seasonal variation corresponded
   directly to groundwater levels in the riparian zone near the catchment
   outlet, suggesting that seasonal changes in groundwater levels were the
   dominant factor controlling temporal variation in stream NO3-
   concentrations. The mechanism of the seasonal pattern found in this
   watershed emphasizes the importance of hydrological seasonality with the
   high precipitation, groundwater levels, and runoff rates that are seen
   in summer in Japan, whereas in forested watersheds in Europe and the
   eastern USA the smaller inorganic nitrogen pools and low transportation
   forces simultaneously affect NO3- leaching during summer. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{A hydrological experiment was conducted in a small headwater catchment
   in southeast Dartmoor, UK, to monitor tile temporal and spatial
   variations in soil moisture content at the hillslope scale in order to
   determine how the spatial organization affected runoff generation. Two
   distinctly different types of rainfall response were found. During tile
   dry state the soil moisture pattern was very patchy and the increase in
   stream discharge was relatively small for most rainstorms. The catchment
   response was limited to about 10\% of the area, a figure that is similar
   in extent to the saturated area identified in the valley bottom. During
   the wet state, however. modest to large storms resulted it significantly
   higher discharge rates. The area generating the runoff increased Lip to
   65\% of the area. The division between the two `preferred' states
   Occurred at a catchment wetness of about 0.60 cm(3) cm(-3). This figure
   was based firstly on the exceptional increase in range, as determined by
   geostatistical analyses, for the soil moisture content measured
   associated with very high stream discharges. Secondly, it was consistent
   with a steep rise in gradient noted for the soil moisture characteristic
   curves at about 0.60 cm(-3) cm(-3). The greater catchment responses were
   therefore dependent on the pore size distribution plus other soil
   characteristics and the connectivity between the wet areas. Copyright

Abstract = {{A process-based, conceptual runoff model, the tracer-aided catchment
   (TAC) model, is developed and applied to the 40 km(2) Brugga catchment
   in the Black Forest Mountains of southwest Germany. The model accounts
   for different runoff generation processes and runoff components. A
   lumped artificial neural network (ANN) model was also applied using the
   same data set. We compared the output from the two models in an effort
   to improve the efficiency of the TAC model and its model structure using
   physical and chemical data. Both approaches yielded comparably good
   results for daily discharge simulation. The TAC model, which uses
   spatially distributed input data, was superior to the lumped ANN model
   in only one case. Dissolved silica concentration in catchment runoff was
   used to assess the runoff components mixing approach of the conceptual
   TAC model. The ANN simulation of silica time series was superior to that
   of the TAC model. However, using modelled discharge values instead of
   measured data markedly weakened the silica predictions and resulted in a
   performance similar to the TAC model. We conclude that this reflects the
   inevitable non-linear error propagation within the TAC model. The ANN
   silica model improved substantially when hourly data were used instead
   of daily data. According to the ANN, silica dynamics are characterized
   by hysteresis loops in the discharge-silica concentration relationship
   in the short term. In addition, this relationship depends on the
   antecedent moisture conditions in the medium term. About 87\% of the
   hourly silica time series variance was explained by non-linear
   regression with the hydrograph only. The implications of these findings
   are as follows. A simulation of the silica dynamics is possible using
   rather simple models that take into account the dynamics described
   above. In this respect, the TAC approach was confirmed by the ANN.
   However, an appropriate silica modelling time step must be shorter than
   daily values to be in line with the process time scale. Last but not
   least, the silica time series were assumed to reflect the spatial
   distribution of single hydrotopes to the catchment runoff during single
   storms, and thus to provide an independent check for the spatially
   distributed model in addition to the hydrograph. This has proven wrong,
   as the information provided by the silica data is highly redundant to
   that of the hydrograph, illustrated by the fact that the silica dynamics
   can be well described by the empirical model without requiring any
   spatial information. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Runoff generation in a Mediterranean carbonate rock environment-the
   Judaean Mountains, West Bank and Israel-was studied by a 2 day
   sprinkling experiment on an 18 x 10 m(2) plot. During the first day,
   three spells of 24.1 mm h(-1) (12.3 mm), 27.8 mm h(-1) (12.3 mm) and
   14.4 mm h(-1) (12.5 mm) were applied, almost saturating the runoff plot.
   On the second day, 20 h later, two spells of 18.7 mm h(-1) (34.3 min)
   and 35.2 mm h(-1) (25.4 mm) followed. Surface runoff was a combination
   of infiltration excess runoff from rocky portions of the plot and
   saturation excess runoff from areas covered by soil. Soil saturation was
   accelerated by lateral runoff from adjacent rocky areas. Once the plot
   was saturated, 80-90\% of the applied rainfall became surface runoff.
   Significantly different concentrations of chloride, sulphate, and
   nitrate ions in the sprinkled water on two successive days served as
   tracers. During the second day a two-component hydrograph separation
   pointed to the importance of shallow reservoirs playing active parts in
   runoff generation. About 14\% of the flow collected during the second
   day originated from water applied during the first day. During the
   second day of sprinkling, both water sources obviously mixed in
   saturated soil reservoirs and contributed in variable percentages to
   surface flow. It is hypothesized that, at least during high-magnitude
   rainfall, the steep rocky slopes investigated might be regarded as
   flood-generating zones rather than areas Of Pronounced recharge into the
   underlying Yarkon-Taninim aquifer. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{In mountainous catchments the quality of runoff modelling depends
   strongly on the assessment of the spatial differences in the generation
   of the various runoff components and of the flow paths as coupled with
   the amount and intensity of precipitation and/or the snow melting. These
   catchments are also suitable for the intercomparison of different kinds
   of hydrological models, particularly of different approaches for the
   simulation of runoff generation. Two differently structured catchment
   models were applied on the pre-alpine Rietholzbach research catchment
   (3.2 km(2)) within the period 1981-98 and on the high-alpine Dischmabach
   catchment (43 km(2)) within the period 1981-96 for the simulation of
   hydrological processes and of the runoff hydrographs. The models adopted
   are the more physically based WaSiM-ETH model, with grid-oriented
   computation of the water balance elements, and the rather conceptual
   PREVAH model, based on hydrological response units. The simulation
   results and the differences resulting from the application of the two
   models are discussed and compared with the observed catchment
   discharges, with measurements of evapotranspiration, soil moisture,
   outflow of a lysimeter, and of groundwater levels in three access tubes.
   The model intercomparison indicates that the two approaches for
   determining runoff generation with different degrees of complexity
   performed with similar statistical efficiency over a period longer than
   15 years. The analysis of the simulated runoff components shows that the
   interflow is the main runoff component and that the portion of the
   runoff components depends strongly on the approach used. The snowmelt
   model component is of decisive importance in the snowmelt season and
   needs to take into account the role of air temperature and radiation for
   simulating runoff generation in a spatially distributed manner.

Abstract = {{The main objective of this study is to identify runoff generation
   mechanisms in a forested catchment (0.18 km(2)) by comparing model
   simulations against measurements of groundwater levels and streamflow,
   and against separation of runoff components based on isotope tracer
   analysis. The hydrological model used in this study had a physical
   basis, and it consisted of separate procedures for canopy, snow, and
   hillslope processes, and for routing in the channel network. This paper
   concentrates on calibration and validation of the hillslope and routing
   procedures. Winter and summer seasons were examined separately in order
   to isolate different mechanisms controlling groundwater level behaviour.
   The results indicated that seasonal runoff dynamics could be replicated
   without calibration of the hillslope procedure against measured
   streamflow. The routing procedure could merely delay the runoff input it
   received from the hillslope procedure, and it had no influence on how
   large a share of a throughfall/snowmelt event, under different preceding
   climatic conditions, eventually emerged as streamflow. Comparison
   against isotope tracer data suggested that use of groundwater level
   measurements in the model calibration could lead to a more plausible
   simulation of new and old water contributions to strearnflow. Still, the
   modelled new water fraction in streamflow was nearly twice as large as
   the fraction derived from isotope tracer analysis. Improvement of the
   model structure towards a more realistic separation of runoff components
   would require the model to consider residence times of water in
   different parts of the soil domain. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{Improved methods for identification of conceptual parameter values are
   necessary if hydrological models are to be applied to catchments other
   than those to which they have been specifically calibrated. A technique
   has been devised to calculate conceptual parameter sets of a
   semi-distributed hydrological model using a soil hydrological
   classification in addition to topographic data. The method is tested in
   this paper by converting multiple parameter sets, calibrated to two
   separate catchments, into parameter sets for a third catchment.
   The prediction capabilities of the parameter sets are studied for the
   new catchment in terms of both simulation of total streamflow and the
   separation of that flow into three components, corresponding to
   groundwater recharge, subsurface flow, and surface runoff. The results
   from an end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) using geochemical tracers are
   employed to assess the flow separation. Results from the simulations
   demonstrate that there is quite wide variability in the success of the
   parameter sets at predicting streamflow for the new catchment. There is
   also considerable variation in the predicted stream flow separation,
   with only 28 out of 500 Simulations giving a comparable result to the
   EMMA. By accepting or rejecting simulations using these results, the
   EMMA can be used to reduce the structural uncertainty of the model.
   However, it does not help to reduce constraints on acceptable parameter
   Values for the Simulations, and further research is still necessary to
   improve parameter identifiability. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{Preliminary modelling results for a new version of the rainfall-runoff
   model TOPMODEL, dynamic TOPMODEL, are compared with those of the
   original TOPMODEL formulation for predicting streamflow at the Panola
   Mountain Research Watershed, Georgia. Dynamic TOPMODEL uses a kinematic
   wave routing of subsurface flow, which allows for dynamically variable
   upslope contributing areas, while retaining the concept of hydrological
   similarity to increase computational efficiency. Model performance in
   predicting discharge was assessed for the original TOPMODEL and for one
   landscape unit (LU) and three LU versions of the dynamic TOPMODEL (a
   bare rock area, hillslope with regolith <1 m, and a riparian zone with
   regolith <5 m). All simulations used a 30 min time step for each of
   three water years. Each 1-LU model underpredicted the peak streamflow,
   and generally overpredicted recession streamflow during wet periods and
   underpredicted during dry periods. The difference between predicted
   recession streamflow generally was less for the dynamic TOPMODEL and
   smallest for the 3-LU model. Bayesian combination of results for
   different water years within the GLUE methodology left no behavioural
   original or 1-LU dynamic models and only 168 (of 96000 sample parameter
   sets) for the 3-LU model. The efficiency for the streamflow prediction
   of the best 3-LU model was 0.83 for an individual year, but the results
   suggest that further improvements could be made. Copyright (C) 2003 John

Abstract = {{Soil water repellency is generally thought to enhance runoff responses,
   thus representing a potentially important factor in hydrological
   modelling. Attempts to quantify its impacts have, however, either
   focused on soil profiles or plot scales and/or have been unable
   unequivocally to isolate repellency effects from other hydrologically
   important parameters. This research gap is addressed here by comparing
   responses of the same soil or terrain at a range of scales in highly
   repellent and wettable states, thereby limiting the impact of other
   variables. Hydrological responses of forest soils in north-central
   Portugal are assessed using laboratory wetting and rainfall simulation
   experiments at the point (0.002 m(2)) and microplot scales (0.12 m(2)),
   and field runoff responses from plot (16 m(2)) and catchment scales
   (0.33 km(2)).
   At the point scale, water repellency reduced soil wetting by a factor of
   >700 and increased mean runoff for a microplot from 1.5 to 53\% during
   the first 9 min of a simulated rainstorm. At the field-plot scale
   impacts are evident, but less dramatic, with 16 of 45 of storms
   following dry, repellent conditions producing >3\% overland flow
   compared with only one of 60 storms following moist, wettable
   conditions. In contrast, at the catchment scale, storm runoff responses
   were lower following dry, repellent, conditions than with moist,
   wettable conditions, although the time-to-peak was on average 62\%
   shorter for the former compared with the latter conditions. The reduced
   correspondence between the scales is attributed mainly to increased
   capture of locally generated overland flow at the catchment scale by
   bypass routeways that are under-represented at point and plot scales.
   It is concluded that addressing water repellency in distributed
   hydrological modelling has considerable potential for improving
   predictions for affected regions, but that impacts may vary considerably
   from those found in the Portuguese case example. Key parameters for
   determining its impacts are its severity, spatial distribution,
   transient characteristics, and the character and spatial distribution of
   any bypass routeways and wettable subsoil. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley

Abstract = {{There is an increasing demand for modelling the fluxes of chemical
   constituents at the catchment scale. Conceptual runoff models provide a
   basis for such modelling tasks provided that they capture the essential
   hydrological processes. However, most conceptual models do not fully
   address interactions between unsaturated and saturated storage. This can
   lead to unrealistic simulations for watersheds with shallow groundwater,
   where a large part of the soil volume can contribute to both the
   unsaturated and the saturated storage, depending on groundwater levels.
   Adding a small amount of water to the saturated storage will cause a
   significant amount of water stored in the unsaturated zone to change its
   status to `saturated. The maximum volume of the unsaturated storage also
   decreases with rising groundwater levels, i.e. increasing saturated
   storage. In this study, a new model concept was proposed in which
   special emphasis was put on the interaction between saturated and
   unsaturated storage. The total storage was divided into two
   compartments, representing saturated and unsaturated storage, with a
   boundary moving up and down in response to the water budget of the
   compartments. Groundwater dynamics show a distinct pattern along the
   hillslope studied. Groundwater levels in an area close to the stream had
   dynamics similar to runoff, whereas levels further upslope responded to
   rainfall with a delay. To represent these differences in the model, the
   hillslope was Subdivided into a riparian and an upslope reservoir. The
   performance of the new model was compared with that of simpler model
   variants without spatial differentiation and with or without the new
   formulation allowing for interactions between unsaturated and saturated
   storage. The new model approach provided the best results for simulating
   both runoff and groundwater dynamics. The subdivision of the hillslope
   accounted for most of the performance increase. To test the model
   structure further, O-18 concentrations in the stream were simulated and
   compared with measured values. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrochemical tracers (alkalinity and silica) were used in an end-member
   mixing analysis (EMMA) of runoff sources in the 10 km(2) Allt a'
   Mharcaidh catchment. A three-component mixing model was used to separate
   the hydrograph and estimate, to a first approximation, the range of
   likely contributions of overland flow, shallow subsurface storm flow,
   and groundwater to the annual hydrograph. A conceptual, catchment-scale
   rainfall-runoff model (DIY) was also used to separate the annual
   hydrograph in an equivalent set of flow paths. The two approaches
   produced independent representations of catchment hydrology that
   exhibited reasonable agreement. This showed the dominance of overland
   flow in generating storm runoff and the important role of groundwater
   inputs throughout the hydrological year. Moreover, DIY was successfully
   adapted to simulate stream chemistry (alkalinity) at daily time steps.
   Sensitivity analysis showed that whilst a distinct groundwater source at
   the catchment scale could be identified, there was considerable
   uncertainty in differentiating between overland flow and subsurface
   storm flow in both the EMMA and DIY applications. Nevertheless, the
   study indicated that the complementary use of tracer analysis in EMMA
   can increase the confidence in conceptual model structure. However,
   conclusions are restricted to the specific spatial and temporal scales

Abstract = {{Simultaneous measurements of runoff, soil pore water pressure, soil
   temperature, and water chemistry were taken to evaluate the spatial and
   temporal nature of flowpaths in a steep 0.1 ha unchannelled hollow in
   the Tanakami Mountains of central Japan. Tensiometers showed that a
   saturated area formed and a downward hydraulic gradient existed
   continuously in the area near a spring. The amplitude of the
   soil-bedrock interface temperature difference near the spring was
   smaller than that in the upper hollow, although soil depth near the
   spring was smaller than in the upper hollow. This suggests that, in the
   small perennially saturated area near the spring, water percolates
   through the vadose zone mixed with water emerging from the bedrock.
   During summer rainstorms, the soil-bedrock interface temperature
   increased as the ground became saturated. Silica and sodium
   concentrations in the transient saturated groundwater during these
   episodes were significantly lower than those in the perennial
   groundwater, suggesting that both rainwater and shallow soil water had
   important effects on the formation of transient saturated groundwater on
   the upper slope. In this case, the streamflow varied with the soil pore
   water pressure on the upper slope; the soil pore water pressure in the
   area near the spring remained nearly constant. Moreover, the spring
   water temperature was almost the same as the transient groundwater
   temperature on the upper slope. This indicates that the transient
   groundwater in the upper slope flowed to the spring via lateral
   preferential paths. The relative inflow of bedrock groundwater to the
   spring decreased as rainfall increased. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley

Abstract = {{The hydrograph separation technique using natural tracers, in which
   different runoff components are quantified according to their chemical
   signature, is a widely used method for investigating runoff generation
   processes at tile catchment scale. The first objective of this study is
   to demonstrate a modified methodology for separating three and five
   runoff components using O-18 and dissolved silica as tracers. The second
   is to evaluate, with an uncertainty propagation technique using Gaussian
   error estimators, the hydrograph separation uncertainties that arise due
   to different error effects.
   During four summer storm events, an interaction among three main runoff
   components having distinct dissolved silica concentrations was
   demonstrated for the mountainous Zastler catchinent (18.4 km(2),
   southern Black Forest Mountains, southwest Germany). The three main
   runoff components are Surface storage (low silica, saturated and
   impermeable areas), shallow ground water (medium silica, periglacial and
   glacial drift cover), and deep ground water (high silica, crystalline
   detritus and hard rock aquifer). Together with the event and pre-event
   water fractions of surface runoff and shallow ground water runoff, five
   runoff components are considered in all. Pre-event water from shallow
   ground water storage dominated the total discharge during floods and was
   also important during low flows. Event water from shallow ground water
   was detectable only during the falling limb of a larger flood with high
   antecedent moisture conditions and during the peaks of three events with
   low antecedent moisture conditions. Runoff from surface storage is only
   significant during floods and can be composed of event and pre-event
   water. The latter reacts later and is important only during the peak of
   the large event with high antecedent Moisture conditions. Runoff from
   the deeper ground water behaves quite consistently (pure pre-event
   water).
   It is demonstrated that large relative uncertainties must be considered
   for the quantification of runoff components. Uncertainties are caused
   by: (i) tracer analysis and discharge measurement; (ii) intra-storm
   variability of O-18; (iii) elevation effect of O-18 and silica; (N)
   solution of minerals during runoff formation; and (v) general spatial
   heterogeneity of tracer concentrations. The last source of error was the
   most significant. The error structure was analysed in detail and showed
   varying error significance within an event and for different events. It
   is shown that, for the meso-scale catchment investigated, only
   qualitative results of the contribution of a runoff component can be
   obtained by the hydrograph separation technique. The importance of
   reducing errors that have the largest impact is clearly demonstrated;
   therefore, a targeted sampling strategy is required. Copyright (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Conceptual modelling requires the identification of a suitable model
   structure and the estimation of parameter values through calibration
   against observed data. A lack of objective approaches to evaluate model
   structures and the inability of calibration procedures to distinguish
   between the suitability of different parameter sets are major sources of
   uncertainty in current modelling procedures. This paper presents an
   approach analysing the performance of the model in a dynamic fashion
   resulting in an improved use of available information. Model structures
   can be evaluated with respect to the failure of individual components,
   and periods of high information content for specific parameters can be
   identified. The procedure is termed dynamic identifiability analysis
   (DYNIA) and is applied to a model structure built from typical

Abstract = {{Water flow in macropores is an important mechanism of infiltration in
   natural soils and, as such, is crucial for the prediction of runoff
   generation. The major flow processes controlling macropore flow are the
   initiation of macropore flow (water supply into macropores) and the
   water transfer from the macropores into the surrounding soil matrix
   (interaction). The water movement during infiltration and the resulting
   flow paths were studied with combined sprinkling and dye tracer
   experiments under different rainfall intensities and initial soil
   moisture conditions. The dye tracer was continuously applied with the
   sprinkling water on 1 m(2) plots. After the sprinkling, horizontal and
   vertical soil sections were prepared for surveying dye patterns, which
   showed the cumulated flow pathways in the soils. These experiments were
   carried out on four hillslope sites covered with grassland, where
   earthworms mainly built the macropore system. The evaluation of the flow
   processes in the soil was based on classified dye patterns and
   measurements of water content and matric potential. The results
   illustrate how flow in earthworm channels influences general
   hydrological flow processes during extreme rainfall events. Macropore
   flow was initiated from the soil surface or from a saturated or
   partially saturated soil layer. Transfer of water from the macropores
   into the soil matrix was mainly influenced by the soil properties and
   soil water content. The permeability of the underlying bedrock in
   combination with this transfer of water controlled the drainage of the
   macropores. Finally, major effects of macropore flow processes on the
   hydrological response were extracted. Infiltration excess overland flow
   was reduced if water bypassed the less permeable layer through
   macropores, saturation excess overland flow was less affected by
   macropores, and subsurface flow was activated very rapidly because the
   infiltrated water bypassed the soil matrix. This study highlights the
   most important processes that have to be considered in order to
   understand better and to model infiltration in natural soils in the
   future. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The Cetina River is a typical karst watercourse in the deep and
   well-developed Dinaric karst. The total length of the Cetina River open
   streamflow from its spring to the mouth is about 105 km. Estimated mean
   annual rainfall is 1380 mm. The Cetina catchment is built of Triassic,
   Jurassic, and Cretaceous carbonate strata. The western part of the
   catchment by the Cetina River is referred to as the `direct' or
   topographic catchment. It was defined based on surface morphologic
   forms, by connection between mountain chain peaks. This part of the
   catchment is almost entirely situated in the Republic of Croatia. The
   eastern part of the catchment is referred to as the `indirect'
   catchment, and is mainly situated in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Water from the
   `indirect' catchment emerges from the western `direct' catchment in
   numerous permanent and temporary karst springs. Since 1960, numerous
   hydrotechnical works have been carried out on the Cetina River and
   within its catchment. Five hydroelectric power plants (HEPPs), five
   reservoirs, and three long tunnels and pipelines have been built. Their
   operation has significantly altered the natural hydrological regime. The
   Cetina River is divided into two hydrological reaches. In the 65 km
   upstream, the hydrological regime was redistributed within the year: low
   flows had increased and high flows had decreased, although the mean
   annual discharge remained the same. Part of the Cetina watercourse
   downstream from the Prancevici Reservoir lost the majority of its flow.
   The mean annual discharges dropped from 100 m(3) s(-1) to less than 10
   m(3) s(-1) because of the Zakucac HEPP development. Copyright (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Two expeditions (October 1989 and May 1992) were carried out to two
   points of the main Amazon River channel and four tributaries. The
   Solimoes and Madeira rivers, taking their origin in the Andes, are
   whitewater rivers. The Negro River is a typical acid, blackwater river.
   The Trombetas River flows through bauxite-rich areas, and is
   characterized by low concentrations of dissolved humic substances. The
   U-238, U-234, Th-232 and Th-230 activities were recorded from dissolved,
   suspended particulate phases and river bank sediments. The latter were
   analysed for their Ra-226, Ra-228 and Pb-210 contents, and also
   subjected to leaching with 0.2 M hydroxylamine-hydrochloride solution to
   determine the concentrations of radionuclides bound to amorphous Fe
   hydroxides and Mn oxides and hydroxides.
   The dissolved U average concentration in the Amazon system is ten times
   lower than the mean world river concentration. The uranium concentration
   observed at Obidos in the lower Amazon (0.095 mug L-1), where the U
   content in the river bank sediments and suspended matter is lowest,
   suggests U release from the solid phase during river transport. About
   485 t of U are transported annually to the Amazon delta area in
   dissolved form, and 1943 t bound to suspended particulate matter.
   Total U and Th concentrations in the river bank sediments ranged from
   1.59 to 7.14 mug g(-1) and from 6.74 to 32 mug g(-1), respectively. The
   highest concentrations were observed in the Trombetas River. The
   proportion extracted by means of the hydroxylamine solution (HL) was
   relatively high for U in the Trombetas river bank sediment (31\%) and
   for Th in the Solimoes sediment (30\%).
   According to the alpha recoil effects, the U-234/U-238 activity ratios
   of the Andean river waters and downstream Amazon water (Obidos) were >1,
   but were <1 in the Negro River (at Manaus). The activity ratios of
   dissolved U correlate with pH and also with the U activity ratios in the
   river bank sediment hydroxylamine extracts. As expected, the U-234/U-238
   activity ratios in river bank sediments were <1 in the Andean rivers and
   in the downstream Amazon, but they were >1 in the Trombetas and Negro
   rivers. Such ratios probably result from the binding of dissolved
   uranium to solid sediment.
   The Th-228/Th-232 ratios of river bank sediments were close to unity
   (except for the Negro River, where it is lower), suggesting no
   significant Th exchanges between the river water and the sediment. The
   Ra-226/Th-232 activity ratios were <1, and the Ra-226/Ra-228 activity
   ratios generally were significantly higher than the activity ratios of
   their respective parents. This perhaps is the result of easier leaching
   of the Ra-226 parent, Th-230, from solid material (owing to the alpha
   recoil effect) than of the 228Ra parent.
   Uranium and thorium isotopes were used as tools to evaluate the chemical
   weathering rate of rocks in the Amazon system, which was estimated to be
   2.7 cm 1000 year(-1) s(-1). Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{One of the important problems in hydrology is the quantitative
   description of river system structure and the identification of
   relationships between geomorphological properties and hydrological
   response. Digital elevation models (DEMs) generally are used to
   delineate the basin's limits and to extract the channel network
   considering pixels draining an area greater than a threshold area S. In
   this paper, new catchment shape descriptors, the geometric
   characteristics of an equivalent ellipse that has the same centre of
   gravity, the same principal inertia axes, the same area and the same
   ratio of minimal inertia moment to maximal inertia moment as the basin,
   are proposed. They are applied in order to compare and classify the
   structure of seven basins located in southern France. These descriptors
   were correlated to hydrological properties of the basins' responses such
   as the lag time and the maximum amplitude of a geomorphological unit
   hydrograph calculated at the basin outlet by routing an impulse function
   through the channel network using the diffusive wave model. Then, we
   analysed the effects of the threshold area S on the topological
   structure of the channel network and on the evolution of the source
   catchment's shape. Simple models based on empirical relationships
   between the threshold S and the morphometric properties were established
   and new catchment shape indexes, independent of the observation scale S,
   were defined. This methodology is useful for geomorphologists dealing
   with the shape of source basins and for hydrologists dealing with the
   problem of scale effects on basin topology and on relationships between
   the basin morphometric properties and the hydrological response.

Abstract = {{The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), flown on
   board the Terra Earth Observing System (EOS) platform launched in
   December 1999, produces a snow-covered area (SCA) product. This product
   is expected to be of better quality than SCA products based on
   operational satellites (notably GOES and AVHRR), due both to improved
   spectral resolution and higher spatial resolution of the MODIS
   instrument. The gridded MODIS SCA product was compared with the SCA
   product produced and distributed by the National Weather Service
   National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC) for 46
   selected days over the Columbia River basin and 32 days over the
   Missouri River basin during winter and spring of 2000-01. Snow presence
   or absence was inferred from ground observations of snow depth at 1330
   stations in the Missouri River basin and 762 stations in the Columbia
   River basin, and was compared with the presence/absence classification
   for the corresponding pixels in the MODIS and NOHRSC SCA products. On
   average, the MODIS SCA images classified fewer pixels as cloud than
   NOHRSC, the effect of which was that 15\% more of the Columbia basin
   area could be classified as to presence-absence of snow, while overall
   there was a statistically insignificant difference over the Missouri
   basin. Of the pixels classified as cloud free, MODIS misclassified 4\%
   and 5\% fewer overall (for the Columbia and Missouri basins
   respectively) than did the NOHRSC product. When segregated by vegetation
   cover, forested areas had the greatest differences in fraction of cloud
   cover reported by the two SCA products, with MODIS classifying 13\% and
   17\% less of the images as cloud for the Missouri and Columbia basins
   respectively. These differences are particularly important in the
   Columbia River basin, 39\% of which is forested. The ability of MODIS to
   classify significantly greater amounts of snow in the presence of cloud
   in more topographically complex, forested, and snow-dominated areas of
   these two basins provides valuable information for hydrologic
   prediction. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The paper focuses on the channel network of alpine basins, attempting to
   interpret channel reaches in terms of response to erosion and deposition
   processes. Two basins in the Dolomites (north-eastern Italy) were
   considered: the Rio Cordon (5 km(2)) and the upper Boite River (163
   km(2)). The channel network was extracted from raster-type digital
   elevation models (DEM) using a slope-area threshold criterion. A
   contribution area index (CAI), which combines drainage area, A, and
   local slope, S (CAI = A(0.5)S), was used to identify channel heads. The
   channel network extracted from the DEM was then analysed to recognize
   cells showing a value of CAI lower than the threshold adopted for
   channel initiation. Contiguous cells with low values of CAI define
   channel reaches with low transport efficiency. Field surveys carried out
   for some selected cases showed a good agreement between prevailing
   sediment deposition predicted by the analysis of the channel network and
   observed channel morphological features. Sediment sources mapped in two
   study basins were also analysed in relation to the location of channels
   with high potential for sediment deposition: this made it possible to
   classify the potential role of different types of sediment sources with
   regard to basin sediment yield. Topographic characteristics of the
   channel network, expressed by CAI, were compared with a classification
   of channel morphology in the Rio Cordon. It was found that cells with
   low values of CAI frequently occur in the riffle-pool reaches, whereas
   the percentage significantly decreases in step-pool and bedrock
   channels. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Anisotropy and heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity (K) are suspected
   of greatly affecting rates and patterns of ground-water seepage in
   peats. A new laboratory method, termed here the modified cube method,
   was used to measure horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity (K(h)
   and K(v)) of 400 samples of bog peat. The new method avoids many of the
   problems associated with existing field and laboratory methods, and is
   shown to give relatively precise measurements of K. In the majority of
   samples tested, K(h) was much greater than K(v), indicating that the bog
   peat was strongly anisotropic. Log(10)K(h), log(10)K(v), and log(10)
   (K(h)/K(v)) were found to vary significantly with depth, although none
   of the relationships was simple. We comment on the scale dependency of
   our measurements. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Anisotropy and heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity (K) are seldom
   considered in models of mire hydrology. We investigated the effect of
   anisotropy and heterogeneity on groundwater flow in bog peat using a
   steady-state groundwater model. In five model simulations, four sets of
   K data were used. The first set comprised measured K values from an
   anisotropic and heterogeneous bog peat. These data were aggregated to
   produce the following simplified data sets: an isotropic and
   heterogeneous distribution of K; an isotropic and homogeneous
   distribution; and an anisotropic and homogeneous distribution. We
   demonstrate that, where anisotropy and heterogeneity exist, groundwater
   flow in bog peat is complex. Fine-scale variations in K have the
   potential to influence patterns and rates of groundwater flow. However,
   for our data at least, it is heterogeneity and not anisotropy that has
   the greater influence on producing complex patterns of groundwater flow.
   We also demonstrate that patterns and rates of groundwater flow are
   simplified and reduced when measured K values are aggregated to create a
   more uniform distribution of K. For example, when measured K values are
   aggregated to produce isotropy and homogeneity, the rate of modelled
   seepage is reduced by 28\%. We also show that when measured K values are
   used, the presence of a drainage ditch can increase seepage through a
   modelled cross-section. Our work has implications for the accurate
   interpretation of hydraulic head data obtained from peat soils, and also
   the understanding of the effect of drainage ditches on patterns and
   rates of groundwater flow. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We have analysed a series of surface samples from the alpine glaciers of
   Taylor Valley, Southern Victoria Land, Antarctica for their geochemical
   composition. This was done to better establish the role of
   glaciochemical variation on the chemical composition of meltwater
   streams emanating from the glaciers. The chemistry of the snow and ice
   changes with proximity to the ocean and with elevation of the glacier
   surface. The aeolian transport of dry valley dust, as indicated by both
   chemical and particulate matter variations, is a major process affecting
   the overall glacier chemistry and the chemistry of the meltwaters.
   Streams originating on the western edges of the glaciers are more
   impacted by the aeolian input as they are in the direct path of the
   major regional wind direction. Our data strongly suggest that the
   variation in stream geochemistry in Taylor Valley is a result in part of
   the differences in chemical composition of glacier melt. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a concept of `effective length' in hillslopes to
   define the effective area influencing the runoff-producing saturated
   zones of a hillslope or catchment. This effective area of a catchment
   usually is less than that given by its physical boundaries, particularly
   in regions where the total potential evaporation exceeds total rainfall
   on an annual basis. In this paper, expressions for effective lengths in
   hillslopes with different scale, shape and soil properties are derived
   for given climatic conditions. The influence of these variables on
   effective length is investigated. It is shown that, for a given rainfall
   frequency and soil parameters, the effective length changes with the
   planform geometry and profile shape of a hillslope; it is also a
   function of the ratio of available travel opportunity time to the
   hillslope's scale response time. The application of the concept to three
   natural catchments, subdivided into a number of simple hillslopes, is
   described. It is shown that, for these three test catchments and over 24
   years of record, rarely would the entire catchment areas contribute to
   flow at the respective outlets. The implications of the concept of
   effective length for several land-use practices, such as clearing for
   forest for greater water yield, and planting trees for salinity control,
   are discussed. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The complex interactions between rainfall-driven erosion processes and

   experimental device employed earlier in laboratory studies was used to
   measure downslope rain splash and `splash-creep', lateral splash,
   upslope splash and rainfall-driven runoff transport (wash) from a highly
   aggregated clay-rich oxisol exposed to natural rainfall in West Java,
   Indonesia. Two series of measurements were made: the first with the soil
   surface at angles of 0degrees, 5degrees, 15degrees and 40\% and the
   second all at an angle of 5degrees but with different tillage and
   mulching treatments. A number of rainfall erosivity indices were
   calculated from rainfall intensity measurements and compared with
   measured transport components. Overall storm kinetic energy correlated
   reasonably well with sediment transport, but much better agreement was
   obtained when a threshold rainfall intensity (20 turn h(-1)) was
   introduced. Rain splash transport measurements were interpreted using a
   recently developed theory relating detachment to sediment transport.
   Furthermore, a conceptually sound yet simple wash transport model is
   advanced that satisfactorily predicted observed washed sediment
   concentrations. The lack of replication precluded rigorous assessment of
   the effect of slope and soil treatment on erosion processes, but some
   general conclusions could still be drawn. The results stress the
   importance of experiments under conditions of natural rainfall.

Abstract = {{The relationship between streamwater mean residence time (MRT) and
   landscape characteristics is poorly understood. We used tritium (H-3) to
   define our MRT. We tested the hypothesis that baseflow water MRT
   increases with increasing absolute catchment size at the Maimai
   catchments. These catchments are simple hydrologic systems relative to
   many catchments around the world, with uniformly wet climatic
   conditions, little seasonality, uniform and nearly impermeable bedrock,
   steep short hillslopes, shallow soils, and well-characterized hillslope
   and catchment hydrology. As a result, this is a relatively simple system
   and an ideal location for new MRT-related hypothesis 1960s nuclear
   testing spike, atmospheric H-3 levels have now approached near
   background levels and are often complicated by contamination from 4 the
   nuclear industry. We present results for H-3 sampled from our set of
   nested catchments in nuclear-industry-free New Zealand. Because of high
   precision analysis, near-natural atmospheric H-3 levels, and
   well-characterized rainfall H-3 inputs, we were able to estimate the age
   of young (i.e. less than 3 years old) waters. Our results showed no
   correlation between MRT and catchment size. However, MRT was correlated
   to the median sub-catchment size of the sampled watersheds, as shown by
   landscape analysis of catchment area accumulation patterns. These
   preliminary findings suggest that landscape organization, rather than
   total area, is a first-order control on MRT and points the way forward
   for more detailed analysis of how landscape organization affects
   catchment runoff characteristics. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{A 5 year field study was conducted to determine the mechanisms that
   cause snow water equivalent (SWE) pressure sensor measurement errors.
   The objective is to establish design and installation criteria to
   develop an accurate electronic SWE pressure sensor that minimizes
   errors. We monitored a 3 m snow pillow and installed three prototype
   electronic SWE sensors of our own design to examine how SWE errors
   occur. We also measured the heat flux through the prototype sensors and
   the soil, snow temperature, soil moisture content, and soil thermal
   conductivity. The SWEs of snow cores were used to assess the accuracy of
   the snow pillow and prototype sensors. Experimental results indicate
   that SWE measurement errors occur only when the snow-SWE sensor and/or
   the snow-soil interfaces are at the melting temperature. The magnitude
   of SWE errors is related to the diameter of the sensor and the
   difference in heat flux through the sensor and the surrounding soil. SWE
   over-measurement errors occur when the heat flux through the sensor is
   less than through the surrounding soil, producing a snowmelt rate on the
   sensor that is less than on the adjacent soil. SWE under-measurement
   errors occur when the heat flux through the sensor is greater than
   through the surrounding soil. The most severe SWE measurement errors
   occur during the transition from winter to spring, when the snow cover
   first reaches an isothermal condition causing a maximum difference in
   snowmelt rate between an SWE sensor and the surrounding soil. SWE
   measurement errors are reduced by increasing the SWE sensor diameter,
   matching the thermal properties of the soil and SWE sensor, allowing
   water to flow through the sensor, and using a surface cover to diffuse
   heat into the adjacent soil. SWE measurement errors relax through snow
   creep mechanisms that redistribute the snow load equally between the
   sensor and surrounding soil. Published in 2002 by John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulation of snow under forest canopies is known to decline with
   increasing canopy density and leaf area because of snow interception and
   sublimation in the canopy. Seasonal snow accumulation measurements,
   collected over a decade from various forest stands in western Canada,
   were used to test and develop methods to relate forest snow accumulation
   to stand properties and observations of either small-clearing seasonal
   snow accumulation or seasonal snowfall. At sub-stand scales, the
   variability of seasonal snow accumulation was not well related to stand
   leaf area, seasonal interception or small-clearing seasonal snow
   accumulation. At the stand scale, physically based snow interception
   equations predicted seasonal snow accumulation from the stand leaf area
   and the seasonal snow accumulation or snowfall in adjacent clearings. A
   simple parametric form of these equations showed the sensitivity of
   seasonal snow accumulation to leaf area at the forest stand scale and
   suggested a relationship to extrapolate snow accumulation or snowfall
   measurements from clearings to forests. These relationships, developed
   from Canadian boreal forest observations, are consistent with Kuz'min's
   (1960. Formirovanie Snezhnogo Pokrova i Metody Opredeleniya
   Snegozapasov. Gidrometeoizdat: Leningrad) relationship between
   accumulation and canopy density derived from Russian observations,

Abstract = {{In the calculation of the melting of a patchy snow cover, the energy
   advected from the adjacent bare soil to the snow surface is an important
   consideration. The quantity or rate of energy advected depends on the
   fetches and sizes of snow and bare ground patches. Any successful method
   to estimate advection will necessarily require the incorporation of
   relationships describing the same. Complex boundary-layer methods
   require detailed spatial knowledge of the patch sizes, wind direction
   and fetch distances, and are computationally intensive. A physically
   based approach that can be spatially applied using distributions of snow
   patch geometry is required.
   This paper presents a new approach, in which boundary-layer integration
   is used to provide a means of calculating the amount of energy removed
   by the snow patch surface as warmer air moves over it. The method is
   reduced to a simple parametric form, and the relationships describing
   the coefficients required for its application are developed.
   The applicability of this new approach is discussed in light of the
   fractal nature of snow patches, the relationship between the individual
   patch length and area, and the distribution of patch sizes as they
   develop and disappear on the landscape. Copyright 2002 Crown in the

Abstract = {{A new model is presented for simulating snow surface albedo in the open.
   and beneath a mixed-forest canopy. The model has modest input data
   requirements and is an efficient physically based parameterization that
   includes the dependency of albedo on solar zenith angle, cloud cover,
   canopy, snow grain size, litterfall, snowfall, snow depth, and partial
   snow cover. Measurements used in the model validation include incident
   spectral irradiances, wavelength-integrated visible and near-infrared
   albedos, snowfall records, snow depth, snow surface litter fractions,
   and quantity of fine litter in snow cores. Measured and modelled forest
   snow albedos were less than open snow albedos during the accumulation
   phase, when there was little or no surface litter. The model predicts
   lower albedos in the forest during the accumulation phase because of a
   spectral shift to less reflective wavelengths of incident radiation
   under the canopy. Snow grain size was important during both the
   accumulation and ablation phases. Surface litter fraction, incident
   spectra, snowpack depth, and partial snow cover were important factors
   lowering forest albedo during ablation. Despite lower mid-winter albedos
   in the forest, the snow melted more rapidly in the open. During late
   ablation, snow albedo in the open became lower than snow albedo in the
   forest, because of the thinner snow in the open. At the end of the
   ablation season, partial snow cover affected the albedo in the forest
   over a longer time period than in the open. Additional work is needed to
   improve the physical basis of the grain growth model used here and to
   develop a spatial albedo model for open and forested terrain. Published

Abstract = {{In mountainous regions, wind plays a prominent role in determining snow
   accumulation patterns and turbulent heat exchanges, strongly affecting
   the timing and magnitude of snowmelt runoff. In this study, digital
   terrain analysis was employed to quantify aspects of the upwind
   topography related to wind shelter and exposure, to efficiently develop
   a distributed time-series of snow accumulation rates and wind speeds to
   force a distributed snow model. Parameters are presented that determined
   each grid cell's topographic exposure and potential for drift
   development relative to observed winds. Using meteorological data taken
   from both an exposed and a sheltered site in the Reynolds Mountain East
   watershed (0.38 km(2)) in southwestern Idaho, the terrain parameters
   were used to distribute rates of snow accumulation and wind speeds at an
   hourly time step for input to ISNOBAL, an energy and mass balance snow
   model. Model runs were initiated prior to the development of the
   seasonal snow cover and continued through complete meltout for the 1986
   (precipitation 128\% of average), 1987 (66\%), and 1989 (108\%) water
   years. A comprehensive dataset consisting of a time series of aerial
   photographs taken during meltout, measured runoff, and snow data from
   the sheltered meteorological site were used to validate the simulations.
   ISNOBAL forced with accumulation rates and wind fields generated from
   the applied terrain parameterizations accurately modelled the observed
   snow distribution (including the formation of drifts and scoured
   wind-exposed ridges) and snowmelt runoff for all three years of study.
   By contrast, ISNOBAL forced with spatially constant accumulation rates
   and wind speeds taken from the sheltered meteorological site, a typical
   snow-monitoring site, overestimated peak snowmelt inputs and tended to
   underestimate snowmelt inputs prior to the runoff peak. Published in

Abstract = {{In mountainous regions, topographic structure and vegetation control
   patterns of snow deposition, climate conditions, and snowmelt. A
   topographically distributed snow accumulation and melt model (ISNOBAL)
   was coupled to a wind field and snow redistribution model to simulate
   the development and ablation of the seasonal snow cover over a small
   mountainous catchment, the Reynolds Mountain East basin (0.38 km(2)) in
   southwestern Idaho, USA. The model was driven by hourly terrain- and
   canopy-corrected data grids derived from meteorological data from two
   stations located within the catchment for four water years (1986, 1987,
   1989 and 1997). The catchment was divided into four shelter classes,
   based on terrain and vegetation; these were used for an analysis of how
   the mass and energy balance of the snowcover varies over the basin as a
   function of terrain and forest characteristics for each of the selected
   years. As shown by the simulations and verified by detailed point
   measurements and the late-season areal photographs of snow-covered area,
   in all years the wind-exposed areas developed thinner snow covers and
   were essentially bare of snow prior to the onset of spring meltout in
   wind-sheltered areas. The meltout of the wind-sheltered drift and
   canopy-enclosed regions occurred in conjunction with the springtime
   increase in solar radiation generating the bulk of springtime runoff.
   Melt contributions from the drifts may continue into the late spring and
   early summer. This research uses a unique set of point and spatial
   verification data to show that a snow accumulation and ablation model,
   adjusted for wind redistribution effects, reliably simulated the
   topographic and vegetation influences on snow distribution, the energy
   balance, and the hydrology of snow and wind-dominated mountainous
   regions. Published in 2002 by John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Our understanding of snow distribution in the mountains is limited as a
   result of the complex controls leading to extreme spatial variability.
   More accurate representations of snow distribution are greatly needed
   for improvements to hydrological forecasts, climate models, and for the
   future testing and validation of remote-sensing retrieval algorithms. In
   this study, the relative performances of four spatial interpolation
   methods were evaluated to estimate snow water equivalent for three 1
   km(2) study sites in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Each study site is
   representative of different topographic and vegetative characteristics.
   From 1 to 11 April 2001, 550 snow depth measurements and approximately
   16 snow density profiles were obtained within each study site. The
   analytical methods used to estimate snow depth over the 1 km(2) areas
   were (1) inverse distance weighting, (2) ordinary kriging, (3) modified
   residual kriging and cokriging, and (4) a combined method using binary
   regression trees and geostatistical methods. The independent variables
   used were elevation, slope, aspect, net solar radiation, and vegetation.
   Using cross-validation procedures, each method was assessed for
   accuracy. The tree-based models provided the most accurate estimates for
   all study sites, explaining 18-30\% of the observed variability in snow
   depth. Kriging of the regression tree residuals did not substantially
   improve the models. Cokriging of the residuals resulted in a less
   accurate model when compared with the tree-based models alone. Binary
   regression trees may have generated the most accurate estimates out of
   all methods evaluated; however, substantial portions of the variability
   in observed snow depth were left unexplained by the models. Though the
   data may have simply lacked spatial structure, it is recommended that
   the characteristics of the study sites, sampling strategy, and
   independent variables be explored further to evaluate the causes for the
   relatively poor model results. Copyright 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem changes such as glacier recession and alpine treeline advance
   have been documented over the previous 150 years in the Rocky Mountains
   of northern Montana and southern British Columbia and Alberta, a region
   known as the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem (CCE). Such changes are
   controlled, at least partially, by variations in snowpack. The CCE
   consists primarily of public lands, the majority of which is undeveloped
   or wilderness. Consequently, this region is well suited for an
   examination of long-term snowpack variation and associated ecosystem
   change. Data from nine SNOTEL sites provide an indication of the daily
   accumulation and ablation of snowpack over the period 1977-2001, as well
   as the relationship between precipitation, temperature and snowpack. 1
   April data from 21 snow courses indicated the extent of regional
   snowpack variation and trends over the period 1950-2001, and 1 May data
   from three snow courses in Glacier National Park allow this record to be
   extended back to 1922. SNOTEL data suggest CCE snowpacks are larger and
   more persistent than in most regions of the western USA, and that water
   year precipitation is the primary control on 1 April snow water
   equivalent (SWE). Snow course data indicate that variations in both 1
   April and 1 May mean SWE are closely tied to the Pacific decadal
   oscillation, an El Nino-southern oscillation-like interdecadal pattern
   of Pacific Ocean climate variability. Despite relatively stable
   snowpacks and summer temperatures since 1922, the glaciers in Glacier
   National Park have receded steadily during this period, implying a
   significant climatic shift between their Little Ice Age glacial maxima
   (ca 1860) and 1922. Published in 2002 by John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Net ecosystem exchange of CO2 was measured at a temperate peatland in
   southeastern New Hampshire. Classified as a mineral-poor fen owing to
   deep, water-logged peats that are influenced to a limited extent by
   groundwater, the ecosystem is dominated by plants such as sedges (Carex
   spp.) and evergreen shrubs. Ten automatic chambers measured fluxes every
   3 h by sampling changes in headspace concentration of CO2 from November
   2000 through March 2001. The fen was covered in snow for most of this
   period and CO2 was emitted from the snow pack throughout the winter. The
   largest fluxes were associated with ground temperatures of 0 degreesC
   and with declining atmospheric pressure. CO2 effluxes up to 3 mumol
   m(-2) s(-1) were recorded when the ground temperature reached the thaw
   point. Fluxes were lower when the ground temperature rose above 0
   degreesC, however, suggesting that the large fluxes were associated with
   a build up and release of stored CO2 degassing as soon as the ground
   thawed, or by enhanced microbial activity associated with freeze-thaw
   dynamics. The large number of thaw events coupled with frequent
   short-term releases of CO2 suggest that degassing occurred on a regular
   basis with changes in atmospheric pressure and/or microbial
   decomposition occurred beneath the snowpack. The extent of soil freezing
   prior to thaw was also an important factor, with colder soils yielding
   smaller CO2 emissions upon thaw. Although most of the observed CO2 flux
   was efflux from the ecosystem, occasional CO2 uptake by the ecosystem of
   up to 1 mumol m(-2) s(-1) was also observed, indicating small rates of
   photosynthesis even during winter. Photosynthesis occurred only when the
   ground temperature was >0 degreesC. The implications for a warmer
   climate are unclear. If warmer winter temperatures yield less snow in
   the temperate region, then soils could freeze more deeply and result in
   lower CO2 emissions. However, if less snow results in a higher frequency
   of freeze-thaw events, then winter CO2 emissions could be larger with a
   warmer climate. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We present the isotopic composition of meltwater samples from four
   seasonal snowpacks: a warm, maritime snowpack in California; a temperate
   continental snowpack in Vermont; a cold continental snowpack in
   Colorado; and an Arctic snowpack in Alaska. Despite the very different
   climate conditions the delta(18)O of meltwater from all four snowpacks
   increased as melting progressed. This trend is consistent with
   theoretical results that model isotopic exchange between water and ice
   as meltwater percolates through a snowpack.
   We have estimated the systematic error in the hydrograph separation if
   the isotopic composition of a snow core were used in place of that of
   meltwater. Assuming no error in the old water or stream water values,
   the error in the new water fraction depends on: (1) the isotopic
   difference between the snow core and the old water; (2) the isotopic
   difference between the snow core and the meltwater; and (3) the new
   water fraction contributing to the stream flow during a spring melt
   event. The error is large when snowmelt contributes a dominant fraction
   of the stream flow, which may be expected where infiltration of snowmelt
   is limited (e.g. permafrost, urban areas). A particular challenge will
   be how to incorporate the changes in isotopic composition of meltwater
   measured at a point into hydrograph separation models conducted at the
   watershed scale. Published in 2002 by John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional thermodynamic lake ice model (Canadian Lake Ice Model
   or CLIMo) is used to simulate ice phenology on Great Slave Lake (GSL) in
   the Mackenzie River basin, Northwest Territories, Canada. Model
   simulations are validated against freeze-up and break-up dates, as well
   as ice thickness and on-ice snow depth measurements made in situ at
   three sites on GSL (Back Bay near Yellowknife, 1960-91; Hay River,
   1965-91; Charlton Bay near Fort Reliance, 1977-90). Freeze-up and
   break-up dates from the lake ice model are also compared with those
   derived from SSM/I 85 GHz passive microwave imagery over the entire lake
   surface (1988-99).
   Results show a very good agreement between observed and simulated ice
   thickness and freeze-up/break-up dates over the 30-40 years of
   observations, particularly for the Back Bay and Hay River sites. CLIMo
   simulates the ice thickness and annual freeze-up/break-dates with a mean
   error of 7 cm and 4 days respectively. However, some limitations have
   been identified regarding the rather simplistic approach used to
   characterize the temporal evolution of snow cover on ice. Future model
   improvements will therefore focus on this particular aspect, through
   linkage or coupling to a snow model. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{The Canadian government has been compiling various observations on
   freshwater and coastal sea ice conditions for many years. However, the
   records are not easily accessible and are dispersed within different
   government departments. Given this, a major effort was undertaken in
   order to gather all available observations into a common database-the
   Canadian Ice Database (CID). This database will respond to the needs for
   climate monitoring in Canada, the validation and improvement of
   numerical ice models and the development of new remote-sensing methods.
   Indeed, several studies have shown that freshwater ice and sea ice are
   good proxy indicators of climate variability and change.
   The first version of CID contains in situ observations from 757 sites
   distributed across Canada, which were originally kept on digital or
   paper records at the Meteorological Service of Canada Headquarters and
   the Canadian Ice Service (CIS). The CID holds 63 546 records covering
   the period from ice season 1822-23 to 2000-01. An analysis of the
   database allows one to trace the temporal evolution of the ice networks.
   The freeze-up/break-up network of 2000-01 only represents 4\% of what it
   was in 1985-86. A drastic decline of the ice thickness and the snow on
   ice network is also observable. In 1997-98, it represented only 10\% of
   the network that existed in 1984-85. The major budget cuts in Canadian
   government agencies during the late 1980s and the 1990s offer the most
   plausible explanation for the drastic decline in the ice observation
   networks. Weekly ice coverage determination on large lakes from
   satellite imagery by the CIS and the national volunteer ice monitoring
   program, IceWatch, may provide a means of reviving, at least, the
   freeze-up/break-up network. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC) of
   the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) National
   Weather Service (NWS) provides daily satellite-derived snow cover maps
   to support the NWS Hydrologic Services Program covering the coterminous
   USA and Alaska. This study compared the NOHRSC snow cover maps with new
   automated snow cover maps produced by the National Environmental
   Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) and the snow cover
   maps created from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS) imagery. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate and account
   for the differences that occur between the three different snow cover
   mapping techniques. Because each of these snow cover products uses data
   from different sensors at different resolutions, the data were degraded
   to the coarsest relevant resolution. In both comparisons, forest canopy
   density was examined as a possible explanatory factor to account for
   those differences. NOHRSC snow cover maps were compared with NESDIS snow
   cover maps for 32 different dates from November 2000 to February 2001.
   NOHRSC snow cover maps were also compared with MODIS snow cover maps in
   the Pacific Northwest and the Great Plains for 18 days and 21 days,
   respectively, between March and June 2001. In the first comparison,
   where the NOHRSC product (similar to1 km) was degraded to match the
   resolution of the NESDIS data (similar to5 km), the two products showed
   an average agreement of 96\%. Forest canopy density data provided only
   weak explanation for the differences between the NOHRSC and the NESDIS
   snow cover maps. In the second comparison, where the MODIS product
   (similar to500 m) was degraded to match the resolution of the NOHRSC
   product for two sample areas, the agreement was 94\% in the study area
   in the Pacific Northwest, and 95\% in the study area in the Great
   Plains. Published in 2002 by John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study of litter decomposition was part of an extensive project
   examining the partitioning of rainfall, the associated chemistry, and
   litterfall in a dry sclerophyll eucalypt forest and a Pinus radiata
   plantation in southeastern Australia. The eucalypt species studied were
   Eucalyptus rossii, E. mannifera and E. dives. The components tested were
   Pinus radiata needles, leaves of the three eucalypt species, and the
   bark of E. rossii and E. mannifera.
   During the first 16 weeks of the decomposition experiment there was a
   rapid decrease in the concentrations of potassium, magnesium, sodium and
   phosphorus; this was attributed to leaching. During this period,
   concentrations of nitrogen and calcium increased for most components.
   After this period, decomposition became the dominant process, during
   which the concentrations of most elements increased. By the end of the
   experiment there was, compared with the initial values, a marked
   reduction in concentrations of sodium, magnesium and potassium for all
   eucalypt and pine litter. Calcium concentrations increased through time,
   with eucalypt bark showing a mid-period decline. Phosphorus
   concentrations decreased for the eucalypt leaves but increased
   substantially for the pine needles and the eucalypt bark. For all
   components of both the eucalypts and pines, total nitrogen
   concentrations rose consistently throughout the decomposition period.
   This was attributed to the formation of nitrogen-substituted lignin,
   which was more resistant to decomposition than the other
   nitrogen-containing compounds, as well as some nitrogen being stored in
   the microorganisms responsible for decomposition. Because of loss of
   fragmented litter from the litter bags after 16 weeks, the weight
   changes could not be confidently measured after this period. Copyright

Abstract = {{This paper presents preliminary results from the application of a
   transfer-function rainfall-runoff model to ephemeral streams in
   Mediterranean Spain. Flow simulations have been conducted for two small
   catchments (Carraixet and Poyo basins), located in close proximity to
   one another yet with significantly different geological characteristics.
   Analysis of flow simulations for a number of high-flow events has
   revealed the dominant influence of the rainfall on the catchment
   response, particularly for high-rainfall events. Particular success has
   been attained modelling the highest magnitude events in both catchments
   and for all events in the faster responding (Poyo) catchment. In order
   to investigate the viability of the model for forecasting floods in
   ungauged catchments, additional investigations have been conducted by
   calibrating the model for one catchment (donor catchment) and then
   applying it to another (receptor catchment). The results indicate that
   this can be successful when either the donor catchment is a fast
   response catchment or when the model is calibrated using a
   high-magnitude event in the donor catchment, providing that the modelled
   receptor catchment event is of a lower magnitude. Copyright (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Water samples from the Yamuna and its tributaries, one of the major
   river systems draining the Himalaya, have been analysed for their stable
   oxygen and hydrogen isotopes during three seasons (summer, monsoon and
   post-monsoon). The data show clear seasonal and altitudinal variations;
   waters from higher altitudes and those collected during monsoon season
   are characterized by relatively depleted isotopic composition.
   Regression analysis of deltaD-delta(18)O data of samples collected
   during summer and monsoon seasons shows that the slope of the best-fit
   lines are nearly identical to those of precipitation at New Delhi for
   the same period. The similarity in their slopes suggests that the
   isotopic composition of precipitation contributing water to these rivers
   are reasonably well preserved in both monsoon and non-monsoon seasons,
   however, during the non-monsoon period both rainfall and river waters
   carry signatures of evaporation. The `deuterium excess' in river waters
   during the three seasons though overlap with each other, the values
   during October are higher. This can be understood in terms of recycled
   moisture contributions to precipitation. The `altitude effect' for
   delta(18)O in these waters is determined to be 0.11parts per thousand
   per 100 m, a factor of about two less than that reported for the Ganga
   source waters from similar altitudinal range. The variability in
   altitude effects in rivers draining the Himalaya seems to be controlled
   by the `amount effect' associated with the monsoon. The significant
   spatial variability in altitude effect in these river basins, which are
   a few hundred kilometers apart, suggests that reconstruction of
   palaeoelevation in the Himalaya, based on delta(18)O-altitude gradients,
   would depend critically on its proper assessment in the region. This
   study has established a relationship between total cation abundance and
   delta(18)O in waters of the Yamuna mainstream; total cations (corrected
   for cyclic components) double for a 1.4 km decrease in altitude as the
   Yamuna flows downstream. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater temperature and electrical conductivity logs were applied in
   this study to gain an understanding of the hydrogeological behaviour of
   a complex system. This system, compartmentalized by a large number of
   fractures, which may even cause geothermal anomalies, is that of the
   Campo de Dalias in the south-east of the Iberian Peninsula. In addition
   to this complexity one must consider the different levels with aquifer
   properties and their varying lithologies, which in some cases are in
   direct contact with the sea. Vertical sections based upon the various
   logs allow lateral correlation to be made between the anomalies
   detected, and provide information on the existence of both ascending and
   descending vertical flows, and the inflow of sea water into the system.
   Analysis of environmental isotopes (O-18 and D) indicate the areas of
   recharge with the greatest flow velocity. No seasonal variation in the
   isotopes was observed, which suggests that the residence time of the
   groundwater in the aquifer is several years. Radiocarbon dating gave
   estimates of generally long residence times, although in some sectors it
   is possible to detect the current recharge based on its tritium content,
   from rainwater infiltration or seawater intrusion. Copyright (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The effect of soil frost on runoff was investigated using a
   comprehensive data set collected at the Svartberget Experimental Forest,
   near Vindeln, Vasterbotten in northern Sweden. Measurements of snow
   depth, soil temperature, frost depth and other climate parameters have
   been made at three sites since 1981, as part of a long-term climate
   monitoring programme. Simulation residuals from the HBV rainfall-runoff
   model, in which no effect of soil frost is assumed, were compared with
   16 years of measured soil frost conditions. A simple model for
   simulation of soil frost depth was developed and incorporated into the
   HBV model. The model parameters were calibrated to observations of snow
   depth, soil frost depth, groundwater levels and runoff, by use of a
   simple weighted optimization criterion. No clear effect of soil frost
   could be seen on the timing and magnitude of runoff in this analysis, or
   when analysing data on the conservative oxygen isotope O-18. The soil at
   the forested site froze in only slightly more than half the years,
   despite the high latitude and low winter temperatures. Furthermore, the
   soil had often thawed before the start of the spring flood. Almost all
   spring floods, therefore, occurred when the soil was unfrozen. Snow
   depth and soil frost depths were inversely related, with the deepest
   soil frost during winters with little snow. Soil frost therefore is
   unlikely to aggravate the very high floods in forested basins of this
   type, except perhaps under exceptional circumstances such as large rain
   events on frozen ground. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamic modelling for analysis of groundwater flow through
   permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) is addressed in this paper. Permeable
   reactive barriers constitute an emerging technology for in situ
   remediation of groundwater contamination and have many advantages over
   the traditional ex situ treatment methods. The transport domains during
   groundwater flow through PRBs often may involve free-flow or non-porous
   sections. To model the fluid mobility efficiently in such situations,
   the free and porous flow zones (PRBs) must be studied in conjunction
   with each other. The present paper is devoted to the analysis of
   groundwater flow through combined free flow domains and PRBs. The
   free-flow regime is modelled using the Navier-Stokes equations whereas
   the permeable barriers are simulated by either the Darcy or the Brinkman
   equation. In order to couple the governing equations of motions,
   well-posed mathematical formulations of matching boundary conditions are
   prescribed at the interface between the free-groundwater-flow zones and
   the permeable barriers. Combination of the Navier-Stokes equations with
   the Brinkman equation is more straightforward owing to their analogous
   forms. However, the Navier-Stokes and Darcy equations are incompatible
   mathematically and cannot be linked directly. The problem is resolved in
   this paper by invoking validated hydrodynamical expressions for
   describing the flow behaviour at the interfaces between free-flow and
   porous zones. Three schemes for the analyses of fluid flow in combined
   domains are applied to the case of groundwater flow through permeable
   reactive barriers and different model results are compared. Copyright

Abstract = {{The kinematic-wave and diffusive-wave approximations were investigated
   for unsteady overland flow resulting from spatially varying rainfall
   excess. Three types of boundary conditions were adopted: zero flow at
   the upstream end, and critical flow and zero depth-gradient at the
   downstream end. Errors were derived by comparing the dimensionless
   profiles of the flow depth over the plane with those computed from the
   dynamic-wave solution. It was found that the mean errors for both the
   approximations were independent of the type of rainfall excess
   distribution for KF02 > 5, where K is the kinematic-wave number and F-0
   is the Froude number. Therefore, the regions (KF02, kinematic-wave and
   diffusive-wave solutions would be fairly accurate and for any
   distribution of spatially varying rainfall, were characterized. The
   kinematic-wave approximation was reasonably accurate, with a mean error
   of less than 5\% and for the critical depth at the downstream end, for
   KF02 > 20 with F-0 less than or equal to 1; if the rainfall excess was
   concentrated in a portion of the plane, the field where the
   kinematic-wave solution was found accurate, it was more limited and
   characterized for KF02 > 35 with F-0 less than or equal to 1. The
   diffusive-wave solution was in good agreement with the dynamic-wave
   solution with a mean error of less than 5\%, in the flow depth, for KF02
   > 15 with F-0 < 1; for rainfall excess concentrated in a portion of the
   plane, the accuracy of the diffusion wave solution was in a region more
   restricted and defined for KF02 greater than or equal to 30 with F-0
   less than or equal to 1. For zero-depth gradient at the downstream end,
   the accuracy field of the kinematic-wave was found to be greater and
   characterized for KF02 > 10 with F-0 less than or equal to 1; for
   rainfall excess 0 concentrated in a portion of the plane, the region was
   smaller and defined for KF02 > 15 with F-0 less than or equal to 1. The
   diffusive-wave solution was found accurate in the region defined for
   KF02 > 7.5, whereas for rainfall excess concentrated in a 0 portion of
   the plane, the field of accuracy was for KF02 > 12.5 with F-0 less than
   or equal to 1. The lower limits of the regions, defined on KF02, can be
   considered generally valid for both approximations, but for F-0 less
   than or equal to 1 smaller lower limits were also characterized.
   Finally, the accuracy of these approximations was influenced
   significantly by the downstream boundary condition. Copyright (C) 2002

   coverage is investigated. It is found that the direction, duration and
   areal coverage of storm movement have a pronounced effect on the
   discharge hydrograph. The runoff hydrographs resulting from storms
   moving downstream are quite different from those from storms moving

Abstract = {{This paper reports the results of a quantitative source analysis of the
   contemporary and historical sediments delivered to Slapton Higher Ley
   (Devon, UK). Contemporary. suspended and bedload sediment inputs to the
   Higher Ley were apportioned successfully using R- and Q-mode analysis
   and an unmixing model. Pasture topsoil was responsible for 80\% of the
   suspended sediment load during stormflow, but only 50\% under baseflow
   conditions. Channel bank material dominated bedload (70-80\%).
   Dating by (137)Cs of three cores from the Higher Ley indicates that
   rapid sedimentation has occurred since the 1950s and that pasture
   topsoil has been the dominant source of sediment deposited in the Higher
   Ley since the early 1980s. Both the unmixing model and R- and Q-mode
   analysis support this interpretation. However, the robustness and
   validity of applying such source ascription techniques to the sediment
   cores of the Higher Ley is debatable, as chemical and mineral magnetic
   signatures in the cores are `diluted' in comparison with sediment
   sources from the Slapton catchment. Particles-size effects, selective
   transport and post-depositional physical and chemical processes are
   examined as possible causes of this dilution effect. Post-depositional
   alteration of the sediment was identified as the most probable
   explanation, but further analysis of the process was not possible within
   the scope of this study. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from
   upland peat during the period of the autumn flushing. Hydroclimatic
   conditions were monitored in conjunction with measurements of absorbance
   and the E4/E6 ratio of the stream draining an 11.4 km(2) upland peat
   catchment in northern England. During two months of monitoring the
   effects of 67 separate rainfall events were examined showing that:
   1. The peat behaves hydrologically as if it were a two end-member system
   consisting of old, interevent, and new, event, water. Runoff is
   initiated by percolation excess of new water at the acrotelm-catotelm
   interface.
   2. The discharge of dissolved organic matter behaves like a three
   end-member system with the between-event water being low in DOC and
   storm events being characterized by two types of water. Initial runoff
   being characterized by new water rich in DOC that gives way to new water
   depleted in DOC. This transition can be ascribed to the runoff
   progressing from throughflow within the acrotelm progressing to
   saturation-excess overland flow.
   3. Depletion of DOC during storm events is accompanied by a change in
   the character of the DOC as the E4/E6 ratio changes. This suggests that
   the decrease in DOC during events is the result of exhaustion of
   reserves rather than changes in the flowpaths being utilized by runoff.
   4. The amount of carbon released in any event is critically dependent
   upon the time between events during which oxidation processes generate a
   reservoir of available carbon. Production of available carbon in the
   catchment is as high as 4.5 g C per day per m(3) of peat, suggesting a
   turnover rate of peat of the order of 42 years. Copyright (C) 2002 John

Abstract = {{The present study demonstrates the usefulness of principal component
   analysis in condensing and interpreting multivariate time-series of
   water quality data. In a case study the water quality system of the
   lock-regulated part of the River Neckar (Germany) was analysed, with
   special emphasis on the oxygen budget. Pooled data of ten water quality
   parameters and discharge, which had been determined at six stations
   along a 200 km reach of the river between the years 1993 and 1998, were
   subjected to principal component analysis. The analysis yielded four
   stable principal components, explaining 72\% of the total variance of
   the 11 parameters. The four components could be interpreted confidently
   in terms of underlying processes: biological activity, dilution by high
   discharge, seasonal effects and the influence of wastewater. From
   analysing the data of single stations separately, these processes were
   found to be active throughout the complete reach. Considering the oxygen
   budget of the river, the variance of biological activity, representing
   the counteracting processes of primary production and microbial
   degradation, was found to be most important. This principal component
   explained 79\% of the observed variance of oxygen saturation. In
   contrast, the analysis of a reduced data set from the 1970s showed that
   oxygen saturation was then dominated by discharge and temperature
   variations. The findings indicate that the oxygen budget used to be
   governed directly by the emission of degradable matter, whereas nowadays
   eutrophication is most important for extreme oxygen concentrations.
   Therefore, controlling eutrophication has to be the primary goal, in
   order to mitigate the rare episodes of pronounced oxygen over- and
   undersaturation in the future. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A cell-based long-term hydrological model (CELTHYM) that can be
   integrated with a geographical information system (GIS) was developed to
   predict continuous stream flow from small agricultural watersheds. The
   CELTHYM uses a cell-by-cell soil moisture balance approach. For surface
   runoff estimation, the curve number technique considering soil moisture
   on a daily basis was used, and release rate was used to estimate
   baseflow. Evapotranspiration was computed using the FA0 modified Penman
   equation that considered land-use-based crop coefficients, soil moisture
   and the influence of topography on radiation. A rice paddy field water
   budget model was also adapted for the specific application of the model
   to East Asia. Model sensitivity analysis was conducted to obtain
   operational information about the model calibration parameters. The
   CELTHYM was calibrated and verified with measured runoff data from the
   WS\#1 and WS\#3 watersheds of the Seoul National University, Department
   of Agricultural Engineering, in Hwaseong County, Kyounggi Province,
   South Korea. The WS\#1 watershed is comprised of about 35.4\% rice paddy
   fields and 42.3\% forest, whereas the WS\#3 watershed is about 85.0\%
   forest and 11.5\% rice paddy fields. The CELTHYM was calibrated for the
   parameter release rate, K, and soil moisture storage coefficient, STC,
   and results were compared with the measured runoff data for 1986. The
   validation results for WS\#1 considering all daily stream flow were poor
   with R-2, E-2 and RMSE having values of 0.40, -6.63 and 9.69 (mm),
   respectively, but validation results for days without rainfall were
   statistically significant (R-2 = 0.66). Results for WS\#3 showed good
   agreement with observed data for all days, and R-2, E-2 and RMSE were
   0.92, 0.91 and 2.23 (mm), respectively, suggesting potential for CELTHYM
   application to other watersheds. The direct runoff and water balance
   components for watershed WS\#1 with significant areas of paddy fields
   did not perform well, suggesting that additional study of these
   components is needed. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Both laboratory experiments and numerical modelling were conducted to
   study the biodegradation and transport of benzene-toluene-xylenes (BTX)
   in a simulated semi-confined aquifer. The factors incorporated into the
   numerical model include advection, hydrodynamic dispersion, adsorption,
   and biodegradation. The various physico-chemical parameters required by
   the numerical model were measured experimentally.
   In the experimental portion of the study, BTX compounds were introduced
   into the aquifer sand. After the contaminants had been transported
   through the system, BTX concentrations were measured at 12 equally
   spaced wells. Subsequently, microorganisms obtained from the activated
   sludge of a sewage treatment plant and cultured in BTX mixtures were
   introduced into the aquifer through the 12 sampling wells. The
   distribution data for BTX adsorption by the aquifer sand form a
   nonlinear isotherm. The degree of adsorption by the sand varies,
   depending on the composition of the solute. The degradation time,
   measured from the time since the bacteria were added to the aquifer
   until a specific contaminant was no longer detectable, was 35-42 h for
   BTX. The dissolved oxygen, after degradation by BTX compounds and
   bacteria, was consumed by about 40-60\% in the entire simulated aquifer;
   thus the aerobic conditions were maintained. This study provides
   insights for the biodegradation and transport of BTX in aquifers by
   numerical modelling and laboratory experiments. Experimental and
   numerical comparisons indicate that the results by Monod degradation
   kinetics are more accurate than those by the first-order degradation
   kinetics. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Calibrating a comprehensive, multi-parameter conceptual hydrological
   model, such as the Hydrological Simulation Program Fortran model, is a
   major challenge. This paper describes calibration procedures for
   water-quantity parameters of the HSPF version 10.11 using the
   automatic-calibration parameter estimator model coupled with a
   geographical information system (GIS) approach for spatially averaged
   properties. The study area was the Grand River watershed, located in
   southern Ontario, Canada, between 79degrees 30' and 80degrees 57'W
   longitude and 42degrees 51' and 44degrees 3 IN latitude. The drainage
   area is 6965 km(2). Calibration efforts were directed to those model
   parameters that produced large changes in model response during
   sensitivity tests run prior to undertaking calibration. A GIS was used
   extensively in this study. It was first used in the watershed
   segmentation process. During calibration, the GIS data were used to
   establish realistic starting values for the surface and subsurface zone
   parameters LZSN, UZSN, COVER, and INFILT and physically reasonable
   ratios of these parameters among watersheds were preserved during
   calibration with the ratios based on the known properties of the
   subwatersheds determined using GIs. This calibration procedure produced
   very satisfactory results; the percentage difference between the
   simulated and the measured yearly discharge ranged between 4 to 16\%,
   which is classified as good to very good calibration. The average
   simulated daily discharge for the watershed outlet at Brantford for the
   years 1981-85 was 67 m(3) s(-1) and the average measured discharge at
   Brantford was 70 m(3) s(-1). The coupling of a GIS with automatice
   calibration produced a realistic and accurate calibration for the HSPF
   model with much less effort and subjectivity than would be required for
   unassisted calibration. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the prediction of Class A pan evaporation using
   the artificial neural network (ANN) technique. The ANN back propagation
   algorithm has been evaluated for its applicability for predicting
   evaporation from minimum climatic data. Four combinations of input data
   were considered and the resulting values of evaporation were analysed
   and compared with those of existing models. The results from this study
   suggest that the neural computing technique could be employed
   successfully in modelling the evaporation process from the available
   climatic data set. However, an analysis of the residuals from the ANN
   models developed revealed that the models showed significant error in
   predictions during the validation, implying loss of generalization
   properties of ANN models unless trained carefully. The study indicated
   that evaporation values could be reasonably estimated using temperature
   data only through the ANN technique. This would be of much use in
   instances where data availability is limited. Copyright (C) 2002 John

Abstract = {{There is a need to be able to differentiate the dissolved organic matter
   (DOM) fraction in river waters. Research in the 1970s and 1980s has
   attempted to utilize both absorbance and fluorescence to distinguish
   between DOM fractions in river waters, but both were limited by the
   available technology. Total organic carbon content has, therefore, been
   widely used as a standard method of measuring DOM concentration,
   although it has little power to differentiate DOM fractions. Recent
   advances in fluorescence spectrophotometry enable rapid and optically
   precise analysis of DOM. Here, we show how a combination of both
   fluorescence and absorbance can be used to discriminate statistically
   between spatial variations of DOM in tributaries in a small catchment of
   the Ousebum, NE England. The results of the discriminant analysis
   suggest that about 70\% of the samples can be correctly classified to
   its tributary. Discriminant function 1 explains 60.8\% of the variance
   in the data and the fulvic-like fluorescence intensity has the largest
   absolute correlation within this function; discriminant function 2
   explains a further 21.5\% of the variance and the fulvic-like
   fluorescence emission wavelength has the largest absolute correlation
   within this function. The discriminant analysis does not correctly
   classify all tributaries every time, and successfully discriminates
   between the different tributaries 70\% of the time. Occasions when the
   tributary waters are less well discriminated are due to either episodic
   pollution events (at two sites) or due to tributaries that have strong
   seasonal trends in spectrophotometric parameters, which allows the sites
   to be misclassified. Results suggest that spectrophotometric techniques
   have considerable potential in the discrimination of DOM in rivers.

Abstract = {{On the cultivated plateau of the loess belt area, the redistribution of
   precipitation is controlled by topography, cultural techniques and
   sealing processes. Recent multi-scale studies carried out in northern
   France have provided quantitative references of interrill erosion rates.
   These experimental references have highlighted significant differences
   and evolution trends of mean sediment concentration in interrill flow
   between different defined categories of soil surface conditions,
   vegetation and rainfall characteristics. Thus, a classification of
   sediment concentration in interrill flow has been elaborated (Cerdan O,
   et al. 2002. Earth Surface Processes and Landforms 27(2): 193-205). The
   objective of this paper is to incorporate these results in the
   elaboration of the interrill erosion module of the STREAM model. At the
   field scale, this classification is used to assign a potential sediment
   concentration value to each agricultural field. For situations where
   there is no, or insufficient, experimental references, the
   classification is completed using a fuzzy logic approach. At the
   catchment scale, sediment is transported in proportion of the runoff
   volumes computed with the STREAM runoff module, and is deposited as a
   function of topography (vertical curvature, slope gradient), or
   vegetation cover. Sediment concentration thresholds were defined after
   field experiments; these thresholds define the limits above which
   sediment mass is deposited. The erosion component of the model has been
   tested with a data set from a small (ca 90 ha) intensively cultivated
   catchment. The quality of prediction given by the root-mean-square error
   (RMSE) is ca 8 t of precision on sediment delivery at the catchment
   outlet for observed sediment delivery that goes from 0.075 to 21 t (with
   an RMSE of ca 0.9 t for observed sediment delivery below 1 t and of ca
   10.6 t for observed sediment delivery between 1 and ca. 21 1). The
   evaluation also showed that the results at the outlet of the catchment
   are more sensitive to the concentration thresholds of the deposition
   rules than to the potential sediment concentration values assigned to
   each field. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Pollutant transport and management in the Rhine and Elbe basins is still
   of international concern, since certain target levels set by the
   international committees for protection of both rivers have not been
   reached. The analysis of the chain of emissions of point and diffuse
   sources to river loads will provide policy makers with a tool for
   effective management of river basins. The analysis of large river basins
   such as the Elbe and Rhine requires information on the spatial and
   temporal characteristics of both emissions and physical information of
   the entire river basin. In this paper, an analysis has been made of
   heavy metal emissions from various point and diffuse sources in the
   Rhine and Elbe drainage areas. Different point and diffuse pathways are
   considered in the model, such as inputs from industry, wastewater
   treatment plants, urban areas, erosion, groundwater, atmospheric
   deposition, tile drainage, and runoff. In most cases the measured heavy
   metal loads at monitoring stations are lower than the sum of the heavy
   metal emissions. This behaviour in large river systems can largely be
   explained by retention processes (e.g. sedimentation) and is dependent
   on the specific runoff of a catchment. Independent of the method used to
   estimate emissions, the source apportionment analysis of observed loads
   was used to determine the share of point and diffuse sources in the
   heavy metal load at a monitoring station by establishing a discharge
   dependency. The results from both the emission analysis and the source
   apportionment analysis of observed loads were compared and gave similar
   results. Between 51\% (for Hg) and 74\% (for Pb) of the total transport
   in the Elbe basin is supplied by inputs from diffuse sources. In the
   Rhine basin diffuse source inputs dominate the total transport and
   deliver more than 70\% of the total transport. The diffuse hydrological
   pathways with the highest share are erosion and urban areas. Copyright

Abstract = {{A regionalization of flood data in British Columbia reveals a common
   scaling with drainage area over the range 0.5 x 10(2) < A(d) < 10(4)
   km(2). This scaling is not a function of flood return period, which
   implies that simple scaling-consistent with a snowmelt-dominated flow
   regime-applies to the province. The observed scale relation takes the
   form Q infinity A(d)(0.75), similar to values reported in previous
   studies. The scaling relation identified was used to define the regional
   pattern of hydroclimatic variability for flood flows in British Columbia
   after discounting the effect of drainage area. The pattern was
   determined by kriging a scale-independent runoff factor k for the mean
   annual flood, 5 year flood and 20 year flood. The analysis permits
   quantification of uncertainty of the estimates, which can be used in
   conjunction with the mapped k-fields to calculate a mean and range for
   floods with the identified return period for ungauged basins. Owing to
   the sparsity of data, the precision is relatively poor. The standard
   error is generally less than 75\% of the estimate in the southern half
   of the province, whereas in the northern half it is often between 75 and
   100\%. Examination of the relative increase in flood magnitude with
   increasing return period reveals spatially consistent but statistically
   insignificant differences. Flood magnitude tends to increase more
   rapidly in the western regions, where rain events may contribute to
   flood generation. The relative increase in flood magnitude with return
   period is consistently lower in the eastern mountain ranges, where
   snowmelt dominates the flood flow regime. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley

Abstract = {{The analytical solution of one-dimensional transport for a single
   species radioactive nuclide, considering the decay term in a single
   fracture for pulse, Dirac delta, and single sinusoid input sources, has
   been studied using the Laplace transform method. The dimensionless
   concentration of the radioactive nuclide in the fracture appears to be a
   function of space, elapsed time, dispersivity, retardation factor,
   half-life of the nuclide, and release time. By comparing different
   values of groundwater velocity, retardation factor, dispersivity, and
   release time, the results show that the c/c(0) ratio agrees with the
   nature of the physical and chemical characteristics of the nuclide in
   fracture transportation. The dimensionless concentration peak value from
   a small retardation factor is found to be more sensitive, within a time
   frame ranging from 10 years to a few hundreds years, than the case with
   a larger retardation factor for H-3. Except for a small variation in the
   peak value, the result is almost the same for pulse and sinusoid inputs
   when considering the H-3 nuclide. Analytical solutions during the
   preliminary screening phase are suitable for performance assessment on
   radioactive waste disposal sites under a one-dimensional single fracture
   condition. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

   Streamflow microflow meter was used to measure the mean velocity
   profiles of flow at different densities of plants, flow ranges and
   measurement positions. Each mean velocity profile consists of three
   hydrodynamic regimes (i.e. within-canopy zone, above-canopy zone and a
   transitional zone between them), which indicate the presence of two
   benthic boundary layers (internal and external ones). Out of 38 measured
   mean velocity profiles, most do not fit a logarithmic relationship. The
   following hydrodynamic parameters are used in characterizing the flow
   regimes: local shear velocity (u({*})), roughness length (z(o)), canopy
   roughness Reynolds number (Re-{*}), bed shear stress (tau(o)) and
   laminar sublayer (sigma). Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The natural heterogeneity of water and solute movement in hillslope
   soils makes it difficult to accurately characterize the transport of
   surface-applied pollutants without first gathering spatially distributed
   hydrological data. This study examined the application of time-domain
   reflectometry (TDR) to measure solute transport in hillslopes. Three
   different plot designs were used to examine the transport of a
   conservative tracer in the first 50 cm of a moderately sloping soil. In
   the first plot, which was designed to examine spatial variability in
   vertical transport in a 1.2 m(2) plot, a single probe per meter was
   found to adequately characterize vertical solute travel times. In
   addition, a dye and excavation study in this plot revealed lateral
   preferential flow in small macropores and a transport pattern where
   solute is focused vertically into preferential flow pathways. The bypass
   flow delivers solute deeper in the soil, where lateral flow occurs. The
   second plot, designed to capture both vertical and lateral flow,
   provided additional evidence confirming the flow patterns identified in
   the excavation of the first plot. The third plot was designed to examine
   lateral flow and once again preferential flow of the tracer was
   observed. In one instance rapid solute transport in this plot was
   estimated to occur in as little as 3\% of the available pore space.
   Finally, it was demonstrated that the soil anisotropy, although
   partially responsible for lateral subsurface transport, may also
   homogenize the transport response across the hillslope by decreasing
   vertical solute spreading. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwaters feeding travertine-depositing rivers of the northeastern
   segment of the Barkly karst (NW Queensland, Australia) are of comparable
   chemical composition, allowing a detailed investigation of how the rate
   of downstream chemical evolution varies from river to river. The
   discharge, pH, temperature, conductivity and major-ion concentrations of
   five rivers were determined by standard field and laboratory techniques.
   The results show that each river experiences similar patterns of
   downstream chemical evolution, with CO2 outgassing driving the waters to
   high levels of calcite supersaturation, which in turn leads to
   widespread calcium carbonate deposition. However, the rate at which the
   waters evolve, measured as the loss of CaCO3 per kilometre, varies from
   river to river, and depends primarily upon discharge at the time of
   sampling and stream gradient. For example, Louie Creek (Q = 0.11 m(3)
   s(-1)) and Carl Creek (Q = 0.50 m(3) s(-1)) have identical stream
   gradients, but the loss of CaCO3 per kilometre for Louie Creek is twice
   that of Carl Creek. The Gregory River (Q = 3.07 m(3) s(-1)), O'Shanassy
   River (Q = 0.57 m(3) s(-1)) and Lawn Hill Creek (Q = 0.72 m(3) s(-1))
   have very similar gradients, but the rate of hydrochemical evolution of
   the Gregory River is significantly less than either of the other two
   systems. The results have major implications for travertine deposition:
   the stream reach required for waters to evolve to critical levels of
   calcite supersaturation will, all others things being equal, increase
   with increasing discharge, and the length of reach over which travertine
   is deposited will also increase with increasing discharge. This implies
   that fossil travertine deposits preserved well downstream of modern
   deposition limits are likely to have been formed under higher discharge
   regimes. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

   NOAA-14 AVHRR and atmospheric data collected during the GAME-Tibet field
   experiment. Comparison with observations at three field sites suggests
   errors in the resulting estimates are less than 10\% in the clear sky
   conditions necessary for application of this approach. Because of the
   need for clear skies, it was only possible to calculate the desired
   regional fields for one satellite scene during the 5 month study period.
   Maps of surface energy fluxes, and frequency analyses of these maps, are
   presented for this scene. The need for an alternative, more consistently
   applicable, satellite-based method to map surface energy fields is

   data from nine stations in the basin for 11 years. Calibration and
   validation results suggested that the spatial resolution of the input
   data in parts of the area was not sufficient for a satisfactory
   evaluation of the modelling performance. The study further examined the
   spatial patterns in the model input and output, and it was found that
   particularly the spatial resolution of the precipitation input had a
   major impact on the model response.
   In an attempt to improve the model performance, this study examines a
   remotely sensed dryness index for its relationship to simulated soil
   moisture and evaporation for six days in the wet season 1990. The index
   is derived from observations of surface temperature and vegetation index
   as measured by the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)
   sensor. The correlation results between the index and the simulation
   results are of mixed quality. A sensitivity analysis, conducted on both
   estimates, reveals significant uncertainties in both. The study suggests
   that the remotely sensed dryness index with its current use of NOAA
   AVHRR data does not offer information that leads to a better calibration
   or validation of the simulation model in a spatial sense. The method
   potentially may become more suitable with the use of the upcoming
   high-resolution temporal Meteosat Second Generation data. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Cyanobacteria are known to form a crust on soil surfaces holding soil
   particles together and thereby offering resistance to erosion. A
   controlled experiment was carried out to throw light on this issue. The
   experiment consisted of subjecting erosion cups filled with soil to
   artificial rainfall in the laboratory. Three sets of erosion cups, each
   set consisting of six, were used. One set consisted of soil with
   inoculated cyanobacteria and the second set consisted of soil with
   naturally colonized cyanobacteria, both over a period of about 8 months.
   The third set consisted of soil with no bacterial growth. The results
   indicate that the soil erosion cups with the inoculated cyanobacterial
   crust had at least one order of magnitude less erosion for coarse soils,
   and about two orders of magnitude less erosion for fine soils, compared
   with erosion cups with no bacterial crust. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley

Abstract = {{The impact of changing catchment vegetation type on mean annual runoff
   has been known for some time, however, the impact on the variability of

   variability of annual runoff are briefly reviewed. The magnitude of any
   change in the variability of annual runoff owing to a change in
   catchment vegetation type is related to the pre- and post-change
   vegetation types and the seasonality of precipitation, assuming that the
   variability of annual precipitation remains constant throughout.
   Significant implications of the relationship between vegetation type and

Abstract = {{Based on the stochastic and phenomenological aspects of hydrological
   processes, a conceptually based stochastic point process (SPP) model for
   daily stream-flow generation is proposed in this paper. In which, storms
   are defined by a stochastic point process with marked values. All the
   random variables defining the process are assumed to be mutually
   independent, which constitutes a compound Poisson point process. The
   direct surface runoff is regarded as occurring from storage in a cascade
   of surface linear reservoirs and is responsible for the short-term
   variation of the daily stream flows. The baseflow component is
   considered as coming from subsurface/groundwater storage and is
   responsible for the long-term persistence of the storm time-series. This
   type of model is proposed as a more realistic model of daily stream flow
   than models based on pure stochastic processes. Studies on the
   instantaneous unit hydrograph and the mechanism of baseflow could
   thereby provide some parameters for this model. Copyright (C) 2002 John

Abstract = {{The Chacarilla fan in the Atacama Desert is one of several formed in the
   Late Miocene at the foot of the Pre-Andean Cordillera overlying the
   large, complex, Pampa Tamarugal aquifer contained in the continental
   elastic sediments of the fore-arc basin. The Pampa Tamarugal aquifer is
   a strategic source of water for northern Chile but there is continuing
   doubt over the resource magnitude and recharge. During January 2000 a I
   in 4 year storm in the Andes delivered a 34 million m 3 flash flood to
   the fan apex where c. 70\% percolated to the underlying aquifers.
   Groundwater recharge through the fan is calculated to be a minimum of
   200 l/s or 6\% of the long-term catchment rainfall. These figures are
   supported by hydrochemical data that suggest that recharge may be 9\% of
   long-term rainfall. Isotopic data suggest groundwater less than 50 years
   old is transmitted westward through the permeable sheetflood sediments
   of the fan overlying the main aquifer. Analysis of this and other events
   shows that the hydrological system is non-linear with positive feedback.
   The magnitude of groundwater recharge is dependent on climatic
   variations, antecedent soil moisture storage and changes in channel
   characteristics. Long-term declines in groundwater level may partly
   result from climatic fluctuations and the causes of such fluctuations
   are discussed. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The loss of P in overland flow from most cultivated soils is controlled
   by erosion, and in-turn soil moisture. We evaluated the effect of soil
   moisture on erosion and P transport in overland flow by applying
   rainfall (7 cm h(-1)) to packed soil boxes (1 m long and 0.15 m wide)
   and field plots (1 and 10 m long by I m wide) of silt loams in a central
   Pennsylvania (USA) catchment. Flow from packed soil boxes took longer to
   initiate as antecedent soil moisture decreased from field capacity (2
   min) to air dried (8 to 9 min). Even in the more complex field plots
   (i.e. soil heterogeneity and topography), the wetter site (1 by 10 m
   plot; 70\% field capacity) produced flow more quickly (3 min) and in
   greater volume (439 L) than the drier site (1 by 10 m plot; 40\% field
   capacity, 15 min, and 214 L, respectively). However, less suspended
   sediment was transported from wetter soil boxes (1.6 to 2.5 g L-1) and
   field plots (0.9 g L-1) than drier boxes (2.9 to 4.2 g L-1) and plots
   (1.2 g L-1). Differences are attributed to their potential for soil
   aggregate breakdown, slaking and dispersion, which contribute to surface
   soil sealing and crusting, as dry soils are subject to rapid wetting (by
   rainfall). During flow, selective erosion and antecedent moisture
   conditions affected P transport. At field capacity, DRP and PP transport
   varied little during overland flow. Whereas P transport from previously
   dry soil decreased rapidly after the initiation of flow (6 to 1.5 mg TP
   L-1), owing to the greater slaking and dispersion of P-rich particles
   into flow at the beginning than end of the flow event. These results
   indicate that soil moisture fluctuations greatly effect erosion and P
   transport potential and that management to decrease the potential for
   loss should consider practices such as conservation tillage and cover
   crops, particularly on areas where high soil P and erosion coincide.

Abstract = {{Residence time of an estuary can be used to estimate the rate of removal
   of freshwater and pollutants from river inflow. In this study, a
   calibrated three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was used to determine
   residence time in response to the change of freshwater input in
   Apalachicola Bay. The bay is about 40 km long and 7 km wide, with an
   average 3 m water depth. Through hydrodynamic model simulations, the
   spatial and temporal salinity and the total freshwater volume in the bay
   were calculated. Then the freshwater fraction method was used to
   estimate the residence time. Results indicate that the residence time in
   Apalachicola Bay typically ranges between 3 and 10 days for the daily
   freshwater input ranging from 177 m(3)/s to 4561 m(3)/s. Regression
   analysis of model results shows that an exponential regression equation
   can be used to correlate the estuarine residence time to changes of
   freshwater input. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated variability and trends in the annual snow-cover
   cycle in regions covering high-latitude and high-elevation land areas in
   the Northern Hemisphere. The annual snow-cover cycle was examined with
   respect to the week of the last-observed snow cover in spring (WLS), the
   week of the first-observed snow cover in autumn (WFS), and the duration
   of the snow-free period (DSF). The analysis used a 29-year time-series
   (1972-2000) of weekly, visible-band satellite observations of Northern
   Hemisphere snow cover from NOAA with corrections applied by D. Robinson
   of Rutgers University Climate Laboratory. Substantial interannual
   variability was observed in WLS, WFS and DSF (standard deviations of
   0.8-1.1, 0.7-0.9 and 1.0-1.4 weeks, respectively), which is related
   directly to interannual variability in snow-cover area in the regions
   and time periods of snow-cover transition. Over the nearly three-decade
   study period, WLS shifted earlier by 3-5 days/decade as determined by
   linear regression analysis. The observed shifts in the annual snow-cover
   cycle underlie a significant trend toward a longer annual snow-free
   period. The DSF increased by 5-6 days/decade over the study period,
   primarily as a result of earlier snow cover disappearance in spring. The
   observed trends are consistent with reported trends in the timing and
   length of the active growing season as determined from satellite
   observations of vegetation greenness and the atmospheric CO2 record.

Abstract = {{One difficulty in modelling sediment transport on unpaved road surfaces
   stems from the inability of physically based models to simulate the
   flush of loose surface material that is deposited on the road surface
   prior to the onset of a storm. This work builds upon a prior modelling
   methodology (referred to as dynamic erodibility) to simulate
   time-varying sediment transport on unpaved mountain roads by loosely
   coupling a continuous, exponential decay disturbance model with the
   erosion algorithm in KINEROS2. The method is tested against sediment
   transport time-series observed on small-scale rainfall simulation plots
   for various slope, antecedent soil wetness and pre-storm sediment
   availability conditions. The new method generally improves prediction
   errors of total sediment output, peak sediment output and fit of the
   sediment output time-series. However, for some validation events, the
   method fails to simulate high initial sediment spikes. This limitation
   may be a side-effect of using data from small-scale plots, but also may
   signify the need for additional calibration of the disturbance model
   subcomponent with data from surfaces having a greater variety of
   pre-event surface material. Nevertheless, this road erosion modelling
   approach provides a realistic `description' of time-varying sediment
   transport, which is controlled both by the baseline erodibility of the
   underlying road surface, and importantly, by the removal of a loose,
   surficial sediment layer by overland flow. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley

Title = {{Effect of snowpack removal on energy balance, melt and runoff in a small
   supraglacial catchment}},

Pages = {{2721-2749}},

Abstract = {{Modelling melt and runoff from snow- and ice-covered catchments is
   important for water resource and hazard management and for the
   scientific study of glacier hydrology, dynamics and hydrochemistry. In
   this paper, a distributed, physically based model is used to determine
   the effects of the up-glacier retreat of the snowline on spatial and
   temporal patterns of melt and water routing across a small (0.11 km(2))
   supraglacial catchment on Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland. The melt
   model uses energy-balance theory and accounts for the effects of slope
   angle, slope aspect and shading on the net radiation fluxes, and the
   effects of atmospheric stability on the turbulent fluxes. The water
   routing model uses simplified snow and open-channel hydrology theory and
   accounts for the delaying effects of vertical and horizontal water flow
   through snow and across ice. The performance of the melt model is tested
   against hourly measurements of ablation in the catchment. Calculated and
   measured ablation rates show a high correlation (r(2) = 0.74) but some
   minor systematic discrepancies in the short term (hours). These probably
   result from the freezing of surface water at night, the melting of the
   frozen layer in the morning, and subsurface melting during the
   afternoon. The performance of the coupled melt/routing model is tested
   against hourly discharge variations measured in the supraglacial stream
   at the catchment outlet. Calculated and measured runoff variations show
   a high correlation (r(2) = 0.62). Five periods of anomalously high
   measured discharge that were not predicted by the model were associated
   with moulin overflow events. The radiation and turbulent fluxes
   contribute c. 86\% and c. 14\% of the total melt energy respectively.
   These proportions do not change significantly as the surface turns from
   snow to ice, because increases in the outgoing shortwave radiation flux
   (owing to lower albedo) happen to be accompanied by decreases in the
   incoming shortwave radiation flux (owing to lower solar incidence
   angles) and increases in the turbulent fluxes (owing to higher air
   temperatures and vapour pressures). Model sensitivity experiments reveal
   that the net effect of snow pack removal is to increase daily mean
   discharges by c. 50\%, increase daily maximum discharges by >300\%,
   decrease daily minimum discharges by c. 100\%, increase daily discharge
   amplitudes by >1000\%, and decrease the lag between peak melt rates and
   peak discharges from c. 3 h to c. 50 min. These changes have important
   implications for the development of subglacial drainage systems.

Abstract = {{An evaluation is made of the suitability of programming languages for
   hydrological modellers to create distributed, process-based hydrological
   models. Both system programming languages and high-level environmental
   modelling languages are evaluated based on a list of requirements for
   the optimal programming language for such models. This is illustrated
   with a case study, implemented using the PCRaster environmental
   modelling language to create a distributed, process-based hydrological
   model based on the concepts of KINEROS-EUROSEM. The main conclusion is
   that system programming languages are not ideal for hydrologists who are
   not computer programmers because the level of thinking of these
   languages is too strongly related to specialized computer science. A
   higher level environmental modelling language is better in the sense
   that it operates at the conceptual level of the hydrologist. This is
   because it contains operators that identify hydrological processes that
   operate on hydrological entities, such as two-dimensional maps,
   three-dimensional blocks and time-series. The case study illustrates the
   advantages of using an environmental modelling language as compared with
   system programming languages in fulfilling requirements on the level of
   thinking applied in the language, the reusability of the program code,
   the lack of technical details in the program, a short model development
   time and learnability. The study shows that environmental modelling
   languages are equally good as system programming languages in minimizing
   programming errors, but are worse in generic application and
   performance. It is expected that environmental modelling languages will
   be used in future mainly for development of new models that can be
   tailored to modelling aims and the field data available. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The finite-volume technique is used to solve the two-dimensional
   shallow-water equations on unstructured mesh consisting of quadrilateral
   elements. In this paper the algorithm of the finite-volume method is
   discussed in detail and particular attention is paid to accurately
   representing the complex irregular computational domain. The lower
   Yellow River reach from Huayuankou to Jiahetan is a typical meandering
   river. The generation of the computational mesh, which is used to
   simulate the flood, is affected by the distribution of water works in
   the river channel. The spatial information about the two Yellow River
   levee, the protecting dykes, and those roads that are obviously higher
   than the ground, need to be used to generate the computational mesh. As
   a result these dykes and roads locate the element interfaces of the
   computational mesh. In the model the finite-volume method is used to
   solve the shallow-wave equations, and the Osher scheme of the empirical
   function is used to calculate the flux through the interface between the
   neighbouring elements. The finite-volume method has the advantage of
   using computational domain with complex geometry, and the Osher scheme
   is a method based on characteristic theory and is a monotone upwind
   numerical scheme with high resolution. The flood event with peak
   discharge of 15 300 m(3)/s, occurring in the period from 30 July to 10
   August 1982, is simulated. The estimated result indicates that the
   simulation method is good for routing the flood in a region with complex
   geometry. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

   demonstrate the need to determine the optimal coal-pile slope that
   minimizes water contact time, but at the same time minimizes the
   potential for mass wasting and rill erosion. Promotion of a compacted
   surface is beneficial for the minimization of solids removal, and a
   stormwater detention pond with potential flocculant additive is
   suggested as a viable remedial measure for the containment and treatment
   of coal-pile runoff. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reviews a number of possible fast and slow hydrological flow
   mechanisms to account for rapid runoff generation within a catchment. A
   new interpretation of the kinematic wave process is proposed which
   develops some of these concepts to explain rapid subsurface flow from a
   watershed. Evidence for the process is provided by the results from a
   laboratory soil core experiment and an investigation of the hydrology of
   a Dartmoor hillslope. A tension response was monitored in the soil core
   in which pressure waves were propagated downwards and expelled water
   from the base. The transmission of the wave down the core was
   considerably faster than the movement of a chloride tracer. The concept
   of this kinematic wave process and associated water flux was then
   extended to the Dartmoor watershed. Raindrops reaching the wet soil
   surface caused pressure waves to travel laterally downslope. During
   large rainstorms, the hillslope became hydrologically highly connected
   and the pressure waves forced existing water from seepage faces into the
   saturated area adjacent to the stream, contributing substantially to the
   stream discharge. A kinematic contributing area was defined, as
   determined by both rainfall-runoff ratios and geostatistical analyses of
   hillslope soil moisture contents, which extended over at least 65\% of
   the catchment area. This kinematic wave theory is consistent with
   results of translatory flow and macropore flow models, and stable
   isotope field studies of `old/new' water. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Daily evapotranspiration from a winter wheat field on the North China
   Plain measured by large-scale weighing lysimeter was linearly related to
   that measured by the Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) technique. Soil
   evaporation averaged about 23.6\% of evapotranspiration from the
   post-winter dormancy revival stage to the grain ripening stage in 1999.
   On clear days during winter dormancy, about half of the net radiation
   flux R-n was used to warm soil. During the revival stage, conductive
   heat flux G also used most of the incoming R-n, but the ratio of latent
   heat flux; E to R-n increased. During the stem-extension stage, lambdaE
   was about 50\% of R-n; thereafter, lambdaE/R-n increased continually,
   but G remained less than 10\% of R-n. During the ripening stage, lambdaE
   was almost 90\% of R-n. Evaporative fraction (EF) can be expressed as a
   function of plant status and atmospheric boundary layer conditions. The
   relationship between EF and available energy under moderate air
   temperature and vapour pressure deficit conditions was examined for five
   combinations of aerodynamic and canopy conductance. Although the
   theoretical relationship indicates that EF should be highly correlated
   to soil water content, the correlation has been difficult to identify
   under field conditions. However, we observed that there exists a
   threshold value of R-n - G, above which EF is less than 1.0, and that
   the threshold value is lower under soil-water deficit conditions than
   under abundant soil-water conditions. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley

Abstract = {{The long-term water level variations of the Dead Sea (DS) were assessed
   using a previously developed simulation model. The model establishes the
   condition of the DS by evaluating a series of ordinary differential
   equations describing mass balances on the water and major chemical
   species. The DS was modelled as a two-layer system. The model was
   modified using up-to-date inflow data and recent hypsometric graphs to
   derive the volume-area-level relationships. Three scenarios were
   studied: continuation of current conditions; a cessation in industrial
   activity when the DS water level drops to a certain level; and a
   simplified weather change scenario. The model predicted that the DS will
   not dry up, but its level will continue to drop with a decelerating rate
   with no equilibrium level in 500 years. Changing climate would
   accelerate the level drop. In the 500 year period, after an initial
   increase, the DS salinity drops. The opposite behaviour is noted in the
   evaporation rate, which increases after an initial decrease. Ceasing
   industrial pumping would eventually restore the DS to its normal level,
   but with changed conditions. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A model for the simulation of shallow landsliding triggered by heavy
   rainstorms is analysed and discussed. The model is applied in two
   mountainous catchments in the Dolomites (Eastern Italian Alps): the
   Cordon catchment (5 km(2)) and the Vauz catchment (1.9 km(2)), where
   field surveys provided a description of hydraulic and geotechnical
   properties of soils and an inventory of landslide scars is available.
   The stability mapping procedure, which is similar to that proposed by
   Montgomery and Dietrich (1994 Water Resources Research 30: 1153),
   combines steady-state hydrologic concepts with the infinite slope
   stability model. The model provides an estimate of the spatial
   distribution of the critical rainfall, which is the minimum steady-state
   rainfall predicted to cause instability. The comparison of the
   landslides observed in the study basins with model predictions shows
   that the distribution of critical rainfall obtained from the model
   provides a surrogate for failure initiation probability as a function of
   topographic location. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Ablation processes of snow under a thin dust cover are complicated
   compared with those under a thick cover, mainly owing to the effects of
   aggregation (redistribution) of dust particles on the conditions of
   surface melting. Aggregation of dust particles causes the snow surface
   to brighten after the initial dust configuration, thus affecting the
   relationship between initial dust concentration and surface albedo. In
   order to estimate snow ablation rate under a thin dust cover, we used a
   composite energy balance model in which the surface albedo is taken as a
   measured input variable. The estimated results of snow ablation agreed
   reasonably well with the observation, considering the measurement errors
   inherited in the snow depressions. Comparison of the two cases, that is,
   one considering the aggregation of dust particles (observation: albedo
   variable) and the other without aggregation (assumption: albedo
   constant), showed that the ablation rates were noticeably lower on the
   former case. This suggests that the aggregation of dust particles
   induces a reduction of snow ablation. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Leaching is an important process in the biogeochemical cycling of
   nutrients from above-ground vegetative surfaces to the forest floor.
   Little is known about winter leaching from deciduous tree species and
   the influence of branch inclination angle on leachate chemistry. Using a
   set of field-based isolated branches harvested from mature crowns of
   Betula lenta, Carya glabra and Quercus rubra, we tested the null
   hypothesis that during winter neither branch inclination angle nor
   branch species would have a detectable influence on differences in
   leachate chemistry and the quantity of intercepted precipitation from
   the branch surface. Leachate concentrations were significantly greater
   from branches inclined at 20degrees than 5degrees or 38degrees. Absolute
   nutrient inputs were also greatest for branches inclined at 20degrees.
   The significantly enriched branchflow and greater total nutrient input
   from branches inclined at 20degrees were attributed to increased
   residence time of intercepted precipitation with the branch surface, the
   lower probability of branch drip than branches inclined at 5degrees, and
   only minimal differences in branchflow quantity compared with branches
   inclined at 38degrees. Branchflow was more enriched from all three
   branch angles during precipitation events of longer duration and lower
   intensity than shorter, intense events. The leachate quantities of K+
   and Ca2+ differ significantly among species. Carya glabra and Quercus
   rubra leached more K+ than Betula lenta. All three species leached
   significantly different amounts of Ca2+, with Quercus rubra leaching the
   most and Carya glabra the least. The adaptive geometry of deciduous
   canopy trees should be considered in relation to the interception of
   precipitation and aqueous leaching during winter when the canopy is
   leafless. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Basic concepts such as conditional probability distributions,
   conditional return periods, and joint return periods are important to
   understand and to interpret multivariate hydrological events such as
   floods and storms. However, these concepts are not well documented in
   the open literature. This paper assembles and clarifies these concepts,
   and illustrates their practical utility. Relationships between joint
   return periods and univariate return periods are also derived. These
   concepts and relationships are demonstrated by applying a bivariate
   extreme value distribution to represent the joint distribution of flood
   peak and volume from an actual basin. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley

Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{2499-2520}},

Abstract = {{The topographically explicit distributed hydrology-soil-vegetation model
   (DHSVM) is used to simulate hydrological effects of changes in land
   cover for four catchments, ranging from 27 to 1033 km(2), within the
   Columbia River basin. Surface fluxes (stream flow and
   evapotranspiration) and state variables (soil moisture and snow water
   equivalent) corresponding to historical (1900) and current (1990)
   vegetation are compared. In addition a sensitivity analysis, where the
   catchments are covered entirely by conifers at different maturity
   stages, was conducted. In general, lower leaf-area index (LAI) resulted
   in higher snow water equivalent, more stream flow and less
   evapotranspiration. Comparisons with the macroscale variable
   infiltration capacity (VIC) model, which parameterizes, rather than
   explicitly represents, topographic effects, show that runoff predicted
   by DHSVM is more sensitive to land-cover changes than is runoff
   predicted by VIC. This is explained by model differences in soil
   parameters and evapotranspiration calculations, and by the more explicit
   representation of saturation excess in DHSVM and its higher sensitivity
   to LAI changes in the calculation of evapotranspiration. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Solute concentrations and fluxes in rainfall, throughfall and stemflow
   in two forest types, and stream flow in a 90 ha catchment in southern
   Chile (39degrees44'S, 73degrees10'W) were measured. Bulk precipitation
   pH was 6.1 and conductivity was low. Cation concentrations in rainfall
   were low (0.58 mg Ca2+ l(-1), 0.13 mg K+ l(-1), 0.11 mg Mg2+ l(-1) and
   <0.08 mg NH4-N l(-1)), except for sodium (1.10 mg l(-1)). Unexpected
   high levels of nitrate deposition in rainfall (mean concentration 0.38
   mg NO3-N l(-1), total flux 6.3 kg NO3-N ha(-1)) were measured.
   Concentrations of soluble phosphorous in bulk precipitation and stream
   flow were below detection limits (<0.09 mg l(-1)) for all events.
   Stream-flow pH was 6.3 and conductivity was 28.3 mus. Stream-water
   chemistry was also dominated by sodium (2.70 mg l(-1)) followed by Ca,
   Mg and K (1.31, 0.70 and 0.36 mg l(-1)). The solute budget indicated a
   net loss of 3.8 kg Na+ ha(-1) year(-1), 5.4 kg Mg2+ ha(-1) year(-1), 1.5
   kg Ca2+ ha(-1) year(-1) and 0.9 kg K+ ha(- 1) year, while 4.9 kg NO3-N
   ha(-1) year(-1) was retained by the ecosystem. Stream water is not
   suitable for domestic use owing to high manganese and, especially, iron
   concentrations.
   Throughfall and stemflow chemistry at a pine stand (Pinus radiata D.
   Don) and a native forest site (Siempreverde type), both located within
   the catchment, were compared. Nitrate fluxes within both forest sites
   were similar (1.3 kg NO3-N ha(-1) year(-1) as throughfall). Cation
   fluxes in net rainfall (throughfall plus stemflow) at the pine stand
   generally were higher (34.8 kg Na+ ha(-1) year(-1), 21.5 kg K+ ha(-1)
   year(-1), 5.1 kg Mg2+ ha(-1) year(-1)) compared with the secondary
   native forest site (24.7 kg Na+ ha(-1) year(-1), 18.9 kg K+ ha(-1)
   year(-1) and 4.4 kg Mg2+ ha(-1) year(-1)). However, calcium deposition
   beneath the native forest stand was higher (15.9 kg Ca2+ ha(-1)
   year(-1)) compared with the pine stand (12.6 kg Ca2+ ha(-1) year(-1)).

Abstract = {{Blanket peat covers the headwaters of many major European rivers. Runoff
   production in upland blanket peat catchments is flashy with large flood
   peaks and short lag times; there is minimal baseflow. Little is known
   about the exact processes of infiltration and runoff generation within
   these upland headwaters. This paper presents results from a set of
   rainfall simulation experiments performed on the blanket peat moorland
   of the North Pennines, UK. Rainfall was simulated at low intensities
   (3-12 mm h(-1)), typical of natural rainfall, on bare and vegetated peat
   surfaces. Runoff response shows that infiltration rate increases with
   rainfall intensity; the use of low-intensity rainfall therefore allows a
   more realistic evaluation of infiltration rates and flow processes than
   previous studies. Overland flow is shown to be common on both vegetated
   and bare peat surfaces although surface cover does exert some control.
   Most runoff is produced within the top few centimetres of the peat and
   runoff response decreases rapidly with depth. Little vertical
   percolation takes place to depths greater than 10 cm owing to the
   saturation of the peat mass. This study provides evidence that the
   quickflow response of upland blanket peat catchments is a result of
   saturation-excess overland flow generation. Rainfall-runoff response
   from small plots varies with season. Following warm, dry weather,
   rainfall tends to infiltrate more readily into blanket peat, not just
   initially but to the extent that steady-state surface runoff rates are
   reduced and more flow takes place within the peat, albeit at shallow
   depth. Sediment erosion from bare peat plots tends to be supply limited.
   Seasonal weather conditions may affect this in that after a warm, dry
   spell, surface desiccation allows sediment erosion to become transport
   limited. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The fate and transport of contaminants in the vicinity of septic fields
   remains poorly understood in many hydrogeomorphological environments. We
   report hydrometric data from an intensive hillslope-scale experiment
   conducted between 29 August and I I November 1998 at a residential leach
   field in New York State. The objective of our study was to characterize
   water flux within the vadose zone, understand the physical controls on
   the flux, and predict how this ultimately will affect subsurface water
   quality. Soil-water flux was calculated using matric potential
   measurements from a network of 25 tensiometer nests, each nest
   consisting of three tensiometers installed to depths of 10, 50 and 130
   cm. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves were derived at each depth
   from field-determined time-domain reflectometry-tensiometry
   moisture-release curves and borehole permeametry measurements. Flownets
   indicated that a strong upward flux of soil water occurred between
   rainstorms. Following the onset of (typically convective) rainfall, low
   near-surface matric potentials were rapidly converted to near-saturated
   and saturated conditions, promoting steep vertical gradients through the
   near-surface horizons of the hillslope. Lateral hydraulic gradients were
   typically 10 times smaller than the vertical gradients. Resultant flow
   vectors showed that the flux was predominantly vertical through the
   vadose zone, and that the flux response to precipitation was
   short-lived. The flux response was controlled primarily by the shape of
   the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves, which indicated a rapid
   loss of conductivity below saturation. Thus, soil water had a very high
   residence time in the vadose zone. The absence of rapid wetting at 130
   cm and the delayed and small phreatic zone response to rainfall
   indicated that water movement through macropores did not occur on this
   hillslope. These results are consistent with a Cl tracing experiment,
   which demonstrated that the tracer was retained in the vadose zone for
   several months after injection to the system. Copyright (C) 2002 John

Abstract = {{Various types of neural networks have been proposed in previous papers
   for applications in hydrological events. However, most of these applied
   neural networks are classified as static neural networks, which are
   based on batch processes that update action only after, the whole
   training data set has been presented. The time variate characteristics
   in hydrological processes have not been modelled well. In this paper, we
   present an alternative approach using an artificial neural network,
   termed real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) for stream-flow forecasting.
   To define the properties of the RTRL algorithm, we first compare the
   predictive ability of RTRL with least-square estimated autoregressive
   integrated moving average models on several synthetic time-series. Our
   results demonstrate that the RTRL network has a learning capacity with
   high efficiency and is an adequate model for time-series prediction. We
   also investigated the RTRL network by using the rainfall-runoff data of
   the Da-Chia River in Taiwan. The results show that RTRL can be applied
   with high accuracy to the study of real-time stream-flow forecasting
   networks. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Through laboratory experiments conducted in a grass-lined flume, the
   hydraulic resistance of grass is measured and quantified. For the grass
   examined, it is found that Manning's n value is greater than those
   recommended in well-established texts such as Chow (1959. Open Channel
   Flow. McGraw-Hill: Singapore), relatively lower than those predicted by
   n-UR methods, but corresponds well with the value found from calibration
   studies of two- and three-dimensional numerical models. The assumption
   of a uniform Manning's n value with flow depth, which is often made in
   numerical modelling, may be invalid depending on the relative
   submergence of the vegetation. Drag coefficients are evaluated for a
   method applicable to three-dimensional numerical models. Further
   detailed experimental investigation and application of these approaches
   within a numerical modelling framework is now recommended. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Turbidity monitoring and rainfall and runoff simulation experiments were
   conducted at a newly constructed unsealed road stream crossing to
   determine the quantity and sources of sediment entering the stream.
   Continuous measurements of turbidity and estimation of total suspended
   solids (TSS) concentration upstream and downstream of the stream culvert
   were taken over a 5 month period. There was a statistically significant
   difference in turbidity and TSS downstream of the crossing during
   baseflow conditions, but the quality of the water column remained good
   during non-rain periods. Rainfall events comprised around 20\% of the
   observation period and led to decreases in water quality downstream of
   the crossing. Water quality could be considered as degraded for 10\% of
   the observations. This was during a period when the rainfall was 65\% of
   the long-term average. Calculated suspended sediment loads were 0-78 t
   upstream and 2.77 t downstream, an increase of 3.5. It was estimated
   that at least 2-3 t of bedload material was also added to the stream
   during the crossing construction and from subsequent erosion. This
   material is a deposit on the cobble stream bed, and is most likely to
   degrade aquatic ecosystem values. Rainfall and runoff simulation
   revealed the principal sediment sources to be a fillslope that
   contributed coarse bedload material through rill erosion and unprotected
   toe scour, and the unmetalled road verge that provided fines. Although
   the quality of water column was good for the majority of the
   observations, the new Australian and New Zealand Water Quality
   Guidelines for Fresh and Marine Waters suggest this site exceeded
   `trigger levels' that would warrant further investigation for both the
   water column and the bed deposits. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{Subsurface flow is an important component of the catchment hydrological
   cycle. Various mechanisms of this process and their role in storm-flow
   generation attracted the attention of many researchers throughout the
   twentieth century. The results of most of these studies are well
   documented. However, similar studies conducted in the past by many
   Russian hydrologists have never been made available to the English
   speaking hydrological community. This paper attempts to fill this gap
   and briefly review some of these investigations, focusing on their main
   results. It starts with the review of the early experimental studies
   (after 1930s-1950s), which allow the main characteristics of subsurface
   storm flow to be established. This is followed by a review of the
   research conducted in 1960s, which resulted in some conceptualization of
   the subsurface flow mechanisms. The paper also draws some parallels
   between this, mostly unknown, subsurface flow research in Russia and the
   better-known contemporary studies of this process. Copyright (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The Tabernas desert, an extensive badlands area in Almeria province
   (south-east Spain), is characterized by a high variability in soil
   surface cover and soil properties along with important topographical
   contrasts giving rise to a wide range of hydrological behaviour. A
   double approach through field monitoring and modelling has been used to
   ascertain the influence of soil-surface variability on the overall
   hydrological response.
   Small plots were monitored for 3 years to assess runoff from the
   different surface types. Data provided by the long-term monitoring of
   three small catchments formed by different soil surfaces were used to
   find out the specific contribution of each soil surface to the catchment
   runoff.
   A simple spatially distributed model was built to predict runoff
   generation based on the infiltration rate of each soil-surface type
   (defined as terrain units with the same cover, the same soil type and on
   the same landform). Plot results prove that the soil surface units
   within the study area behave differently in terms of hydrological
   response to natural rainfall. These responses are explained by the types
   of cover, topographical characteristics and soil properties. When runoff
   events are simple (with one or two runoff peaks), the modelled
   hydrographs reproduce the hydrographs observed reasonably well, but in
   complex events (with several runoff peaks) the adjustment is not as
   good. The model also shows the influence of the spatial distribution of
   soil surfaces on the overall runoff, aiding exploration of the spatial
   hydrological relationships among different landscape units. Copyright

Abstract = {{This study uses a system dynamics approach to explore hydrological
   processes in the geographic locations where the main contribution to
   flooding is coming from the snowmelt. Temperature is identified as a
   critical factor that affects watershed hydrological processes. Based on
   the dynamic processes of the hydrologic cycle occurring in a watershed,
   the feedback relationships linking the watershed structure, as well as
   the climate factors, to the streamflow generation were identified prior
   to the development of a system dynamics model. The model is used to
   simulate flood patterns generated by snowmelt under temperature change
   in the spring. Model structure captures a vertical water balance using
   five tanks representing snow, interception, surface, subsurface and
   groundwater storage. Calibration and verification results show that
   temperature change and snowmelt play a key role in flood generation.
   Results indicate that simulated values match observed data very well.
   The goodness-of-fit between simulated and observed peak flow data is
   measured using coefficient of efficiency, coefficient of determination
   and square of the residual mass curve coefficient. For the Assiniboine
   River all three measures were in the interval between 0.92 and 0.96 and
   for the Red River between 0.89 and 0.97. The model is capable of
   capturing the essential dynamics of streamflow formation. Model input
   requires a set of initial values for all state variables and the time
   series of daily temperature and precipitation information. Data from the
   Red River Basin, shared by Canada and the USA, are used in the model
   development and testing. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The maximum depth of a river section is schematized as a non-stationary
   continuous-parameter continuous stochastic process, with a
   three-parameter lognormal distribution. Two processes, represented by a
   first-order and a second-order differential equation, are considered.
   Non-stationarity is accounted for by the mean, the other parameters
   being assumed constant. The continuous processes are then discretized as
   AR(1) and ARMA(2,1) processes respectively, and used for computing the
   conditional probability (which is of practical interest) for a given
   maximum depth not to be exceeded in a period of given length. The models
   are applied to the River Po (Italy) and the AR(1) model is found to be
   preferable. An analysis of the effect of discretizing the parameter is
   also carried out, considering the second-order model and the conditional
   probability, for which analytical results for the continuous-parameter
   model are available. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A 9-year rainfall, sediment yield and runoff generation record from four
   experimental plots has been studied. Plots are located in the central
   Ebro Basin over smooth hillslope developed over gypsum and marl Miocene
   deposits. The hydrological response of these areas is a function of soil
   properties, final infiltration capacity and permeability of soils and
   rainfall characteristics, such as intensity and amount. Results show
   that there are two types of hydrological response in these areas. First
   is Hortonian like, which takes place during wet periods and it is
   responsible for the main part of total sediment yield. Second is like
   saturation excess overland flow, and it appears after long period. The
   presence of either type is controlled by a double threshold, starting
   from when runoff is significant. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{Stream water was analysed to determine how induced watershed
   acidification changed the chemistry of peakflow and baseflow and to
   compare the relative timing of these changes. Two watersheds in
   north-central West Virginia, WS3 and WS9, were subjected to three
   applications of ammonium sulphate fertilizer per year to induce
   acidification. A third watershed, WS4, was the control. Samples were
   collected for 8 years from WS9 and for 9 years from WS3. Prior to
   analyses, concentration data were flow adjusted, and the influence of
   natural background changes was removed by accounting for the chemical
   responses measured from WS4. This yielded residual values that were
   evaluated using robust locally weighted regression and Mann-Kendall
   tests. On WS3, analyte responses during baseflow and peakflow were
   similar, although peakflow responses occurred soon after the first
   treatment whereas baseflow responses lagged 1-2 years. This lag in
   baseflow responses corresponded well with the mean transit time of
   baseflow on WS3. Anion adsorption on WS3 apparently delayed increases in
   SO4 leaching, but resulted in enhanced early leaching losses of Cl and
   NO3. Leaching of Ca and Mg was strongly tied, both by timing and
   stoichiometrically, to NO3 and SO4 leaching. F-factors for WS3 baseflow
   and peakflow indicated that the catchment was insensitive to acid
   neutralizing capacity reductions both before and during treatment,
   although NO3 played a large role in reducing the treatment period
   F-factor. By contrast, the addition of fertilizer to WS9 created an acid
   sensitive system in both baseflow and peakflow. On WS9, baseflow and
   peakflow responses also were similar to each other, but there was no
   time lag after treatment for baseflow. Changes in concentrations
   generally were not as great on WS9 as on WS3, and several ions showed no
   significant changes, particularly for peakflow. The lesser response to
   treatment on WS9 is attributed to the past abusive farming and site
   preparation before larch planting that resulted in poor soil fertility,
   erosion, and consequently, physical and chemical similarities between
   upper and lower soil layers. Even with fertilizer-induced NO3 and SO4
   leaching increases, base cations were in low supplies and, therefore,
   unavailable to leach via charge pairing. The absence of a time lag in
   treatment responses for WS9 baseflow indicates that it has substantially
   different flow paths than WS3. The different hydrologies on these nearby
   watersheds illustrates the importance of understanding watershed
   hydrology when establishing a monitoring programme to detect ecosystem
   change. Published in 2002 by John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Most land-based forestry systems use extensive networks of unsealed
   tracks to access the timber resource. These tracks are normally drained
   by constructing cross-banks, or water bars, across the tracks
   immediately following logging. Cross-banks serve three functions in
   controlling sediment movement within forestry compartments:
   1. they define the specific catchment area of the snig track (also known
   as skid trails) so that the overland flow does not develop sufficient
   energy to cause gullies, and sheet and rill erosion is reduced;
   2. they induce some sediment deposition as flow velocity reduces at the
   cross-bank;
   3. they redirect overland flow into the adjacent general harvesting area
   (GHA) so that further sediment deposition may take place.
   This paper describes a simple model that predicts the third of these
   functions in which the rate of runoff from the track is combined with
   spatial attributes of the track and stream network. Predictions of the
   extent of the overland flow plumes and the volume of water delivered to
   streams is probabilistically presented for a range of rainfall-event
   scenarios with rainfall intensity, time since logging and compartment
   layout as model inputs. Generic equations guiding the trade-off between
   intercross-bank length and flow path distance from cross-bank outlet to
   the stream network needed for infiltration of track runoff are derived.

   Gossenkollesee (2413 m, Tyrol, Austria) was determined by measuring the
   flushing rate of a tracer substance. During holomixis in July 1997, when

   lithium chloride solution was injected into the lake causing the lithium
   concentration to rise from the background value of 0.06 to 3.1 mug L-1.
   The water residence time was derived from the exponential decline of the

Abstract = {{The decay of roughness is an important factor governing surface
   processes such as infiltration and soil erosion. Thus the decay of
   surface roughness under different surface conditions was investigated
   and related to quantitative amounts of soil loss, runoff and sediment
   concentration in a laboratory experiment.
   Rainfall with an intensity of 128 mm/h was applied to a bare or mulched
   surfaces of a sandy loam soil with known surface roughness at specified
   time intervals. The decay of roughness as expressed by roughness ratio,
   in this experiment, was better predicted when related to an exponential
   function of the square root of cumulative kinetic energy of rainfall
   rather than with the cumulative rainfall. The roughness decay equations
   in literature did not predict breakdown under mulched surfaces
   accurately. Thus the exponent parameters of the roughness decay
   equations were adjusted to reflect the reduced decay occurring under
   mulched surfaces.
   In a bare soil, regression equations expressing the dependent variables
   as a function of initial roughness index were significant, but with low
   coefficients of determination, being 0.39 for soil loss, 0.12 for runoff
   and 0.36 for sediment concentration. In addition to initial roughness
   index, cumulative kinetic energy of rainfall was further included in the
   regressions. This led to an increase in coefficients of determination,
   which was 0.81 for soil loss, 0.74 for runoff and 0.49 for sediment
   concentration.
   The coefficients of determination (0.87 for soil loss, 0.85 for runoff
   and 0.51 for sediment concentration) were further increased when the
   final roughness index was included in addition to initial roughness
   index and cumulative kinetic energy in the regressions.
   This work shows that soil loss and runoff could be predicted from bare
   soil surface provided the initial roughness and the energy of rainfall
   is known. However, field verifications of these relationships are needed
   under different tillage tools and under natural rainfall. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{For a 26 month period, between 1 February 1998 and 31 March 2000, total
   precipitation, throughfall, stemflow and interception losses were
   measured for two different forest covers, one a managed broadleaved
   native forest and the other a Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco
   (Douglas fir) plantation. Regressions between throughfall and stemflow
   and total precipitation (P) for individual storms and forest covers were
   computed and also for values of interception losses (expressed as a
   percentage of P) and P for each forest cover and period of development
   of the forest vegetation. Results obtained demonstrate the importance of
   forest canopies in rainfall distribution processes and for the
   availability of water resources. Also, that these forests generate
   particular interception patterns not strongly associated with the
   variation in crown cover throughout the year. These patterns are more
   closely related to the characteristics of rainfall and meteorological
   conditions during the growing and dormant periods. Copyright (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Oxygen isotopic data are presented for bulk glacial meltwaters draining
   the Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Valais, Switzerland and for the sulphate
   contained within them in an attempt to assess the redox status of the
   subglacial chemical weathering environment. The sulphate derived from
   subglacial chemical weathering is so depleted in O-18 that it must have
   formed, at least partially, in an anoxic environment. Under these
   conditions, Fe3+ can act as an oxidizing agent and oxygen atoms
   incorporated into sulphate are derived from O-18-depleted water
   molecules (by contrast, dissolved O-2 is strongly enriched in O-18).
   These data therefore support the hypothesis that sectors of the glacier
   bed are anoxic and that Fe3+ may act as a significant oxidizing agent
   under these conditions. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the formulation and application of a coupled
   unsaturated/saturated model framework developed to investigate the
   impact of mining on catchment water yield and groundwater dynamics. The
   model conceptualization was implemented in both a finite-element
   (SUSCAT) and finite-difference (WEC-C) solution scheme and found to give
   similar results. The model framework simulates a coupled surface-water
   and groundwater system in which a physically based solution scheme was
   used to simulate one-dimensional movement through the unsaturated zone,
   and a distributed model was used to simulate two-dimensional saturated
   groundwater flow. Each soil column comprises a series of layers, each
   layer being connected to adjacent cells. Subsurface lateral flow is
   considered when any cell within a layer develops a saturated thickness.
   Simulation results presented are based on a catchment in the Darling
   Range, Western Australia that was progressively mined and subsequently
   rehabilitated. The results predicted the groundwater system beneath the
   mine areas to have a peak rise owing to mining of between 2 and 4 m. Six
   years after mining, and following vegetation rehabilitation, the
   groundwater rise had reduced to 1 m above simulated unmined levels. The
   corresponding streamflow increase as a result of mining was estimated to
   peak at 21 mm/year and declined to 7.4 mm/year eight years after
   revegetation of the mined areas. The simulated groundwater response and
   streamflow results derived from both models were found to be consistent
   with observed data. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an optimal regulation programme, grey fuzzy
   stochastic dynamic programming (GFSDP), for reservoir operation. It is
   composed of a grey system, fuzzy theory and dynamic programming. The
   grey system represents data by covering the whole range without loss of
   generality, and the fuzzy arithmetic takes charge of the rules of
   reservoir operation. The GFSDP deals with the multipurpose
   decision-making problem by fuzzy optimization theorem. The
   practicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on
   the operation of the Shiman reservoir in Taiwan. The current M5
   operating rule curves of this reservoir also are evaluated. The
   simulation results demonstrate that this new approach, in comparison
   with the M5 rule curves, has superior performance with regard to the
   total water deficit and number of monthly deficits. Copyright (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Mathematical modelling of overland flow is a critical task in simulating
   transport of water, sediment and other pollutants from land surfaces to
   receiving waters. In this paper, an overland flow routing method is
   developed based on the Saint-Venant equations using a discretized
   hillslope system for areas with high roughness and steep slope. Under
   these conditions, the momentum equation reduces to a unique relationship
   between the flow depth and discharge. A hillslope is treated as a system
   divided into several subplanes. A set of first-order non-linear
   differential equations for subsequent subplanes are solved analytically
   using Chezy's formula in lieu of the momentum equation. Comparison of
   the analytical solution of the first-order non-linear ordinary
   differential equations and a numerical solution using the Runge-Kutta
   method shows a relative error of 0.3\%. Using runoff data reported in
   the literature, comparison between the new approach and a numerical
   solution of the full Saint-Venant equations showed a close agreement.

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this study is to investigate the possibility of
   including more temporal and spatial information on short-term inflow
   forecasting, which is not easily attained in the traditional time-series
   models or conceptual hydrological models. In order to achieve this
   objective, an artificial neural network (ANN) model for short-term
   inflow forecasting is developed and several issues associated with the
   use of an ANN model are examined in this study. The formulated ANN model
   is used to forecast 1- to 7-h ahead inflows into a hydropower reservoir.
   The root-mean-squared error (RMSE), the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient
   (NSC), the A information criterion (AIC), B information criterion (BIC)
   of the 1- to 7-h ahead forecasts, and the cross-correlation coefficient
   between the forecast and observed inflows are estimated. Model
   performance is analysed and some quantitative analysis is presented. The
   results obtained are satisfactory. Perceived strengths of the ANN model
   are the capability for representing complex and non-linear relationships
   as well as being able to include more information in the model easily.
   Although the results obtained may not be universal, they are expected to
   reveal some possible problems in ANN models and provide some helpful
   insights in the development and application of ANN models in the field
   of hydrology and water resources. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{Kinematic wave solutions are derived for transport of a conservative
   non-point-source pollutant during a rainfall-runoff event over an
   infiltrating plane for two cases: (i) finite-period mixing and (ii)
   soil-mixing zone. Rainfall is assumed to be steady, uniform and finite
   in duration, and it is assumed to have zero concentration of pollutants.
   Infiltration is assumed constant in time and space. Prior to the start
   of rainfall, the pollutant is distributed uniformly over the plane. In
   the first case, when rainfall occurs, the mixing of pollutant in the
   runoff water occurs in a finite period of time. In the second case, the
   chemical concentration is assumed to be a linearly decreasing function
   of rainfall intensity and overland flow. The solute concentration and
   discharge are found to depend on the flow characteristics as well as the
   solute concentration parameters. The characteristics of solute
   concentration and discharge graphs seem to be similar to those reported
   in the literature and observed in laboratory experiments. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The creation of a World Lake Vision is essential to achieving the
   sustainable management of the world's lakes. We discuss the value of
   lakes, how those values have historically led to changes in watershed
   land-use and population, and how changes have resulted in stresses that
   impair lake value. Current approaches to lake management at both the
   local and international level are examined and their shortcomings
   highlighted. We illustrate how a World Lake Vision, along with the
   individual lake visions it promotes, can redress the shortcomings of
   current lake management approaches. Details of the World Lake Vision and
   the process of its creation are put forth. We end with a critique of the
   World Water Vision presented at the second World Water Forum in March
   2000 from the perspective of lakes and conclude that, in its current
   form, the World Water Vision provides an inadequate guide for
   sustainable lake management. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of large dam construction projects on the human environment,
   and particularly on resettlers, is often the main reason for opposition
   toward large dam construction projects. The World Commission on Dams
   (WCD) published its only and final report `Dams and Development' in
   November 2000. The report contains a set of 26 guidelines. The WCD
   itself mentioned that the guidelines are not intended as a blueprint,
   and that these should be used as a starting point for discussion.
   Despite the clarification by the WCD, some non-governmental
   organizations argue that these guidelines must be immediately adopted
   for all future large dam projects. The authors assume that only several
   of these guidelines are operational and many of these are either too
   experimental or theoretical to be put into use. Furthermore, some
   seemingly `ready for operation' guidelines still need to be enhanced to
   be really operational in the real world. About 2000 large dams were
   constructed in Japan after World War II. Various principles and
   mechanisms were then developed to better address the issues related to
   involuntary resettlement. The knowledge accumulated through large dam
   construction projects in Japan may be applied to other countries. The
   aim of this paper is to identify the lessons, out of the experiences
   gained in Japan through large darn construction projects in the past,
   which could be applicable for future large dam construction projects in
   other nations. The socio-economic setting, as well as the legal
   framework, in Japan differs much from those in the developing world.
   Nevertheless, the following aspects of the experiences gained in Japan
   are found to be both applicable and useful for future large dam
   construction projects abroad: (a) integrity of community in the
   negotiation process, (b) provision of alternative occupations, (c)
   funding mechanism in the post-project period, (d) measures needed during
   planning process; and (e) making resettlers `shareholders'. These
   lessons may prove useful to enhance the WCD guidelines. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The La Plata River Basin is one of the largest international river
   basins in the world, with an area of about 3 million km(2). It spreads
   across five countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and
   Uruguay), and its water resources are essential for their economic
   development. Together with reservoir development, extensive
   deforestation, intensive agriculture practices and large urban
   developments took place in the Parana, Paraguay and Uruguay basins,
   affecting environmental conditions and raising important issues
   concerning water resources use and conservation. Therefore, the need to
   promote participatory and cooperative efforts among water resources
   stakeholders, as well as the systematic exchange of information and
   experiences on common regional problems among organizations and experts
   from throughout the basin who are devoted to water resources use and
   management, was reported by researchers and managers gathered at the
   First and Second International Workshops on Regional Approaches for
   Reservoir Development and Management in the La Plata River Basin (held
   in 1991 and 1994). As a concrete response to this need, the efforts of a
   number of organizations from various countries within the basin, with
   the support of international and national governmental organizations,
   resulted in the foundation of La Plata River Basin Environmental
   Research and Management Network (RIGA) in March 2001. This was within
   the framework of the Third International Workshop, which was precisely
   one of the short-term activities included in the RIGA Action Plan.
   During the preparatory processes for the RIGA Network, the presence of
   Japanese cooperation supporting the La Plata River Basin Workshops
   through a non-governmental international organization (ILEC) played an
   important role in stimulating such an organization-based joint approach
   in the basin. This outcome, although not originally planned, constituted
   a welcomed byproduct of its main specific interest in the region, which
   was the establishment of international sustainable management guidelines
   for lake and reservoir management. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{Coastal hydrogeologists and oceanographers now recognize the potentially
   significant contribution that submarine groundwater discharge (SGD)
   could make to the coastal ocean. SGD may be both volumetrically and
   chemically important to coastal water and chemical budgets. A worldwide
   compilation of observed SGD shows that groundwater seepage from the land
   to the ocean occurs in many environments along the world's continental
   margins. Further, SGD has a significant influence on the environmental
   condition of many nearshore marine environments and provides a strong
   motivation for improved assessments. Our review reveals a critical lack
   of data from coastal zones of almost all parts of the world, especially
   in South America, Africa and parts of Asia, making a comprehensive
   compilation incomplete. SGD should be paid more attention with regard to
   water and dissolved material budgets at the local and global scales. SGD
   intercomparison experiments and coastal typologies (classification) may
   enable evaluation of the accuracy of the SGD estimates and up-scaling of
   SGD to a global scale. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{River freezing is a common phenomenon at high latitudes. The Lena River,
   one of the four largest rivers flowing into the Arctic Ocean, freezes
   over completely from early December to late April. The process of
   river-ice formation affects not only the river flow and local energy
   regime, but also influences hydrological and thermal conditions in the
   Arctic Ocean. In this study, a combined hydrological model used for a
   cold-region basin (Ma et al., 2000. Hydrological processes 14: 639-651)
   was further developed to model hydrological processes in the Lena River.
   A simple method of accumulated degree-days was used in describing
   river-ice growth and decay. River flow routing was used to compute the
   hydrograph according to the depth of runoff stored in the river and the
   season. The combined model system was applied to the Lena River basin,
   using data for the period October 1986 to September 1987, and produced
   modelled hydrographs at six river sections that were an improvement on
   those resulting from the earlier study. Although the simulation duration
   in this study was limited to I year, it is expected that the model
   system will be an effective tool in making hydrological simulations in
   cold regions in the future. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A series of wind tunnel experiments were conducted to investigate the
   effect of surface roughness distribution on evaporation processes. In
   particular, the relationship between non-homogeneous roughness
   distribution parameters and effective roughness parameters, which are
   often required to estimate the evaporation rate over a heterogeneous
   area, were examined closely. A number of sand ridges having various
   distributions were placed perpendicular to the main wind direction on a
   3 m long lysimeter (I m in width and 0.6 m in depth) filled with fine
   sand. The groundwater table in the lysimeter was maintained at a
   constant level ranging from 0.1 to 0.55 m below the surface. The
   lysimeter was fitted to the wind tunnel, in which incoming airflow was
   controlled to have a constant velocity, temperature, and humidity. An
   internal boundary layer was formed on the sand surface and the mean
   profiles of wind velocity, humidity, and temperature were observed
   within this layer. In total, 99 profiles over 33 different surfaces were
   obtained. The roughness parameters for each surface were evaluated by
   fitting the mean profile equations to the observed profiles. The
   following effects of roughness distribution on evaporation and the
   effective roughness parameters were found. (1) An increase in standard
   deviation of the roughness distribution, which is the variation in
   obstacle intervals, caused an increase in the evaporation rate when the
   average roughness spacing was constant and relatively large. (2) The
   interrelationships among effective roughness z(m), z(v), and Z(h) can be
   described by the same function that describes that of homogeneous
   surfaces. (3) Evaporation from rough surfaces was more sensitive to the
   depth of groundwater than that from the smooth surface within our
   experimental conditions, because the rough surfaces allow soil water
   over a broader range of depth to reach the surface. The first two
   results suggest that the effective roughness parameters are a function
   of the average and perturbation of roughness distribution on the surface
   and that the effective zv and Zh values can be estimated from effective
   z(m) value. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The sensitivity of land surface processes to frozen soil permeability
   and surface water storage is examined, using a one-dimensional land
   surface model that can be implemented in a climate model. The
   atmospheric conditions are specified at three stations in frozen ground
   regions of Russia. Soil moisture has its maximum in spring and minimum
   in summer, which corresponds with the observations. By taking the frozen
   soil permeability into consideration, both the wet zone above the thaw
   front in spring and the water uptake towards the freezing front in
   winter can be reproduced by the model. The surface depression storage
   increases the soil moisture in spring by holding snowmelt water and in
   summer after rainfall, which induces changes in the annual heat and
   water budget. The annual evaporation is reduced by the frozen soil
   permeability and it is enhanced by the surface storage. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The characteristics of evapotranspiration and canopy surface conductance
   of winter wheat have been measured and analysed by using the Bowen
   ratio-energy balance (BREB) method. In order to understand better the
   effect of soil water status on evapotranspiration and conductance of
   wheat, the daily and seasonal variations of leaf stomatal resistance
   under different soil water conditions have also been monitored and
   analysed. The experiments have been carried out at Luancheng
   Experimental Station of Agro-ecosystem (LESA), Heibei, People's Republic
   of China. During the growing seasons after turning to green, most of the
   available energy (Rn - G) of the wheat field is partitioned into latent
   heat. In the daily course, generally, the Bowen ratio (H/LE) for winter
   wheat is less than one-third; sometimes, it can reach a value of around
   0.4. The seasonal trend of LE/Rn shows a parabola curve. The ratio of
   LE/Rn varies from 71 to 93\%, with the peak occurring in the blooming
   stage. G/Rn shows a declining logarithmic trend during the observation
   period, and reaches its minimum value of around 6-8\% after blooming.
   According to the BREB method, the daily mean evapotranspiration rate
   from jointing to maturity is 3.9 turn day(-1), which is very close to
   the value 4.1 turn derived from the water balance equation. The daily
   average value for canopy conductance g(c) is about 7.8 mm s(-1).
   Seasonal trend of leaf stomatal resistance shows that the stomatal
   resistance in blooming and milking are lower than that in other growing
   stages. This is possibly determined by the characteristic of water
   requirement of winter wheat. The stomatal conductance is strongly
   dependent on soil water status in natural conditions. When the
   extractable soil water content (ESW) of the 0-40 cm layer is less than
   50\%, the leaf stomatal conductance g(st) is linearly dependent on ESW,
   whereas there is no relation between ESW and g(st) when ESW is more than
   50\%. Therefore, the ESW of 50\% can be considered as a threshold value
   of extractable soil water content for controlling the leaf stornatal
   conductance, or as an indicator of incipient stornatal closure. The
   slope of the g(st)-ESW line varies through the growing stages, with the
   largest slope occurring in the milking stage. Based on the analysis of
   g(st)-ESW relations, we construct a simple but realistic model of
   stornatal conductance-soil moisture relations. Copyright (C) 2002 John

Abstract = {{A decision support system (DSS) is developed and applied to assess the
   susceptibility of water supply systems to droughts, and to aid
   decision-makers in determining optimal supply strategies. The DSS
   integrates three fundamental modules for water resources management: (1)
   a real time rainfall-runoff forecasting model enhanced by Kalman
   filtering; (2) a water demand forecast model; and (3) a reservoir
   operation model. Simulation and optimization procedures for the
   reservoir operation model are based on risk analysis to evaluate the
   system performance and to derive the most appropriate supply strategy of
   minimum risk, for the designed operating conditions. The optimization
   technique, based on genetic algorithms, introduces two new and distinct
   features, with the aim of minimizing the risks of drought damage and
   improving the convergence of the model toward practical solutions.
   Firstly, risk-based measures of system performance, termed reliability,
   resiliency and vulnerability, are combined into a global risk index,
   referred to as the drought risk index (DRI). The DRI, formulated as a
   weighted function of the risk measures, serves as the objective function
   to be minimized during the search for the optimal operation. Secondly,
   in the genetic algorithm search, each new generation of water supply
   solutions is created from solutions with risk levels clustered inside a
   defined `acceptable risk space'. In other words, the convergence of the
   algorithm is improved by retaining only those solutions with DRI values
   smaller than the maximum acceptable risk. As a case study, the DSS is
   applied to the water resources system in Fukuoka City, western Japan.
   The DSS is believed to be an efficient tool for the assessment of a
   sequence of water supply scenarios, leading to the improved utilization
   of existing water resources during drought. Copyright (C) 2002 John

Abstract = {{Post-depositional change of isotope concentration was investigated in a
   temperate snow pack. Daily snow pit studies were carried out at Moshiri,
   Hokkaido, for about a week in April 1998. During this time the snow
   layers were at the melting point. Isotope analysis was conducted on snow
   particles and the liquid water in between the particles every 5 cm in
   depth, and on the precipitation and the runoff water (from the bottom of
   the snow pack) collected during the observation period. It was found
   that the oxygen isotope concentration in the liquid part was smaller by
   about 2parts per thousand than the solid part of the wet snow. The
   difference between the isotope concentrations of the liquid and the
   solid was low in the surface snow layer, but increased at the bottom.
   The results suggested that isotope fractionation took place between the
   liquid and the solid, when liquid water (formed by melting at the snow
   surface layer) flowed groundwards. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{Temperature profiles of 22 observation boreholes in the Ishikari basin
   were investigated in order to extract information on the ground thermal
   processes and the associated water flow disturbances. Data analyses
   methods were based on temperature profile typology, thermal
   gradient-temperature plots, and a thermo-hydraulic model. The
   distributed data sets of measured temperature profiles and thermal
   conductivity show lateral heat flow variations from 34 to 162 mW m(-2).
   These thermal conditions revealed the co-existence of a highland
   geothermal field, a lowland central subnormal heat flow area, and a
   strong heat flow anomaly near the northeast Ishikari River. To explain
   this specific configuration of the thermal field, possible effects of
   petro-physical properties, topography and groundwater movements were
   examined with a three-dimensional thermo-hydraulic simulation model.
   Laboratory measurements of thermal conductivity, porosity, density, and
   permeability from borehole core samples were used to constrain the model
   parameters. The main results suggest that: the lateral increase of
   geothermal gradient and heat flow density with elevation, i.e. in the
   southwest direction, are essentially due to hydro- and thermo-physical
   differences between the hydrogeologically active Quaternary sedimentary
   system and the underlying Tertiary volcano-sedimentary formation; the
   low heat area in the central lowland may be explained by the effect of
   its local groundwater flow recharge, and then the positive heat anomaly
   near the Ishikari River would result from a basin-wide heat flow
   redistribution by water flow. In general, the thermal regime in the
   Ishilkari basin appears dominated by conduction processes in the
   southwest area and strongly influenced by advection phenomena in the
   northeast. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In order to bring large amounts of precipitation, the new seeding method
   using liquid carbon dioxide (LC) was suggested by Fukuta (1996a). The
   method was applied to the supercooled convective cloud in a post-frontal
   weather condition in northern Kyushu, Japan, on October 27 1999. In the
   seeding experiment, LC seeding and the subsequent observation by
   aircraft were carried out and the features of a seeded echo were
   observed by radar. Consequently, the aircraft observation confirmed the
   further development of the seeded cumulus together with a fuzzy aspect
   of the cloud surface, which indicates the feature consisting of ice
   particles. Furthermore, the observed cloud top was quite consistent with
   the cloud top estimated by the thermodynamic analysis following parcel
   theory. Therefore, the observed results indicate the artificial effects
   by LC seeding. On the other hand, the radar observation confirmed all
   artificially induced echo, which showed spreading of the echo area and
   took a unique mushroom shape in the RHI pictures. The maximum width of
   the echo reached 24 kin and the total amount of estimated radar
   precipitation of the seeded cumulus was approximately 2.4 million ton,
   traversing a distance of 60 km in 1 h 40 min. The observed and estimated
   results are consistent with the hypothesis of the new seeding method,
   which induces the dynamic and microphysical processes consisting of two
   fundamental processes. In addition, it was found that dynamical
   interaction between the seeded and the adjacent natural cumuli was an
   important factor in the formation of the secondary cumulus. The
   observational fact will give new viewpoint into the future seeding
   study. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes preliminary results from a method for the treatment
   of complex bed topography for the understanding of three-dimensional
   flow processes. It develops an established porosity-based method and
   couples it to high-resolution bed topographical data acquired using
   digital photogrammetry. The results provide quantitative data on flow
   processes that match and perhaps exceed current measurement
   capabilities, and so raise difficult questions for model validation.
   However, the detailed flow fields provided by the method allow us to
   develop current models for flow-form interactions in gravel-bed rivers.
   Of most importance, the method will allow us to enhance significantly
   the application of computational fluid dynamics to complex river bed
   morphology, for large eddy simulation, roughness parameterization,
   sediment entrainment and deposition studies, and understanding
   interactions between flow and vegetation in relation to conveyance
   studies. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The major goal of this paper is to evaluate the ability of the
   physically based land surface model SWAP to reproduce heat and water
   exchange processes that occur in mid-latitude boreal grassland regions
   characterized by a clear seasonal course of hydrometeorological
   conditions, deep snow cover, seasonally frozen soil, as well as
   seasonally mobile and shallow water table depth. A unique set of
   hydrometeorological data measured over 18 years (1966-83) at the
   Usadievskiy catchment (grassland) situated in the central part of Valdai
   Hills (Russia) provides an opportunity to validate the model. To perform
   such validation in a proper way, SWAP is modified to take into account a
   shallow water table depth. The new model differs from its previous
   version mainly in the parameterization of water transfer in a soil
   column; besides that, it includes soil water-groundwater interaction, A
   brief description of the new version of SWAP and the results of its
   validation are presented.
   Simulations of snow density, snow depth, snow water equivalent, daily
   snow surface temperature, daily evaporation from snow cover, water yield
   of snow cover, water table depth, depth of soil freezing and thawing,
   soil water storage in two layers, daily surface and total runoff from
   the catchment, and monthly evaporation from the catchment are validated
   against observations on a long-term basis. The root-mean-square errors
   (RMSEs) of simulations of soil water storage in the layers of 0-50 cm
   and 0-100 cm are equal to 16 mm and 24 mm, respectively; the relative
   RMSE of simulated annual total runoff is 16\%; the RMSE of daily snow
   surface temperature is 2.9degreesC (the temperature varies from 0 to
   -46degreesC); the RMSE of maximum snow water equivalent (whose value
   averaged over 18 years is equal to 147 mm) is 32 mm, Analysis of the
   results of validation shows that the new version of the model SWAP
   reproduces the heat and water exchange processes occurring in
   mid-latitude boreal grassland reasonably well. Copyright (C) 2002 John

Abstract = {{Small-scale heterogeneities and large changes in hydraulic gradient over
   short distances can create preferential groundwater flow paths that
   discharge to lakes. A 170 m 2 and within an area of springs and seeps
   along the shore of Shingobee Lake, Minnesota, was intensively
   instrumented to characterize groundwater-lake interaction within
   underlying organic-rich soil and sandy glacial sediments. Seepage meters
   in the lake and piezometer nests, installed at depths of 0.5 and 1.0 m
   below the ground surface and lakebed, were used to estimate groundwater
   flow. Statistical analysis of hydraulic conductivity estimated from slug
   tests indicated a range from 21 to 4.8 x 10(-3) m day(-1) and small
   spatial correlation. Although hydraulic gradients are overall upward and
   toward the lake, surface water that flows onto an area about 2 m onshore
   results in downward flow and localized recharge. Most flow occurred
   within 3 m of the shore through more permeable pathways. Seepage meter
   and Darcy law estimates of groundwater discharge agreed well within
   error limits. In the small area examined, discharge decreases
   irregularly with distance into the lake, indicating that sediment
   heterogeneity plays an important role in the distribution of groundwater
   discharge. Temperature gradients showed some relationship to discharge,
   but neither temperature profiles nor specific electrical conductance
   could provide a more convenient method to map groundwater-lake
   interaction. These results suggest that site-specific data may be needed
   to evaluate local water budget and to protect the water quality and
   quantity of discharge-dominated lakes. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Empirical prediction equations of the form W = aQ(h) have been reported
   for rills and rivers, but not for ephemeral gullies. In this study six
   experimental data sets are used to establish a relationship between
   channel width (W, m) and flow discharge (Q, m(3) s(-1)) for ephemeral
   gullies formed on cropland. The resulting regression equation (W = 2.51
   Q(0.412); R(2) = 0.72; n = 67) predicts observed channel width
   reasonably well. Owing to logistic limitations related to the respective
   experimental set ups, only relatively small runoff discharges (i.e. Q <
   0.02 m(3) s(-1)) were covered. Using field data, where measured
   ephemeral gully channel width was attributed to a calculated peak runoff
   discharge on sealed cropland, the application field of the regression
   equation was extended towards larger discharges (i.e. 5 x 10(-4) m(3)
   s(-1) < Q < 0.1 m(3) s(-1)).
   Comparing W-Q relationships for concentrated flow channels revealed that
   the discharge exponent (b) varies from 0.3 for rills over 0.4 for
   gullies to 0.5 for rivers. This shift in b may be the result of: (i)
   differences in flow shear stress distribution over the wetted perimeter
   between rills, gullies and rivers, (ii) a decrease in probability of a
   channel formed in soil material with uniform erosion resistance from
   rills over gullies to rivers and (iii) a decrease in average surface
   slope from rills over gullies to rivers.
   The proposed W-Q equation for ephemeral gullies is valid for (sealed)
   cropland with no significant change in erosion resistance with depth.
   Two example, illustrate limitations of the W-Q approach. In a first
   example, vertical erosion is hindered by a frozen subsoil. The second
   example relates to a typical summer Situation where the soil moisture
   profile of an agricultural field makes the top 0.02 in five times more
   erodible than the underlying soil material. For both case's observed W
   values are larger than those predicted by the established channel width
   equation for concentrated flow on cropland. For the frozen soils the
   equation W = 3.17 Q(0.368) (R(2) = 0.78; n = 617) was established, but
   for the summer soils no equation could be established. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Study of the mobility of contaminants in an aquifer is an important
   issue for the proper remediation of contaminated groundwater.
   Determination of associated solute transport parameters therefore is
   essential for investigation of the extent to which-roundwater can be
   contaminated. This study aimed at determining solute transport
   parameters for an unconfined sandy aquifer at a laboratory scale through
   various tracer tests using a conservative solute as a tracer. Tracer
   tests consisted of both well-tracer tests (single and double wells) and
   an aquifer tracer test using a plume-capturing device such as time
   domain reflectometry (TDR). The results showed that longitudinal
   dispersivities estimated from the single and double well-tracer tests
   were 2.2 cm and 13.5 cm for a travel distance of 9.3 cm and 13.5 cm from
   the injection point respectively. These results agreed reasonably well
   with the results of the aquifer tracer test. The solute transport
   parameters obtained at multiple points in the aquifer through the
   aquifer tracer test revealed that the dispersivity length was
   proportional to the travel distance by a factor of 0.3, which was
   moderately higher than the value of 0.1 given in the literature.

Abstract = {{Cutover bogs do not return to functional peatland ecosystems after
   abandonment because re-establishment of peat-forming mosses is poor.
   This paper presents a conceptual model of bog disturbance caused by peat
   harvesting (1942-1972), and the hydrological evolution that occurred
   after abandonment (1973-1998). Two adjacent bogs of similar size and
   origin, one harvested and the other essentially undisturbed, provide the
   basis for understanding what changes occurred. The model is based on
   historical trends evident from previous surveys of land-use, boa ecology
   and resource mapping; and from recent hydrological and ecological data
   that characterize the current condition. Water balance data and
   historical information suggest that runoff increased and
   evapotranspiration decreased following drainage, but tended towards
   pre-disturbance levels following abandonment, as vegetation recolonized
   the surface and drainage became less efficient over time. Dewatering of
   soil pores after drainage caused shrinkage and oxidation of the peat and
   surface subsidence of approximately 80 cm over 57 years. Comparisons
   with a nearby natural bog suggest that bulk density in the upper 50 cm
   of cutover peat increased from 0.07 to 0.13 g cm(-3), specific yield
   declined from 0,14 to 0.07, water table fluctuations were 67\% greater,
   and mean saturated hydraulic conductivity declined from 4.1 x 10(-5) to
   1.3 x 10(-5) cm s(-1). More than 25 years after abandonment, Sphagnum
   mosses were distributed over broad areas but covered less than 15\% of
   the surface. Areas with `good' Sphagnum regeneration (>10\% cover) were
   strongly correlated with high water tables (mean -22 cm), especially in
   zones of seasonal groundwater discharge, artefacts of the extraction
   history. Forest cover expanded from 5 to 20\% of the study area
   following abandonment. The effect of forest growth (transpiration and
   interception) and drainage on lowering water levels eventually will be
   countered by slower water movement through the increasingly dense soil,
   and by natural ditch deterioration. However, without management
   intervention, full re-establishment of natural hydrological functions
   will take a very long time. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the conservativeness of tracers through the sediment
   generation process. This is done by comparing a selection of tracer
   properties of sediment eroded from large plots by simulated rainfall,
   with the corresponding properties of the source materials within the
   plots. Sediment was generated using three simulated rainfall events for
   each of rive selected erosion source types in the Tarago catchment,
   Victoria, Australia. As there were particle size and organic content
   differences between the source material and the generated sediment, the
   measured tracer properties of the source material were corrected for
   these differences. The possible role of analytical errors in this
   investigation was also addressed. The gechemical property, concentration
   of Fe2O3, was not conservative for any of the process sources
   investigated. Concentration of Al2O3, was not conservative for three of
   the four process sources investigated, and the sum of molecular
   proportions of CaO{*}{*}, Na2O, K2O and Al2O3 was not conservative for
   two of the four process sources investigated. Mineral magnetic
   properties, IRM850 and X were also found to be not conservative,
   although this may be the result of the complex relationship between
   particle size and mineral magnetic properties not being adequately
   accommodated in this analysis. The radionuclide tracers, Cs-137 and
   Pb-210(ex), were found to be conservative through the sediment
   generation process. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we extend the generalized likelihood uncertainty
   estimation (GLUE) technique to estimate spatially distributed
   uncertainty in models conditioned against binary pattern data contained
   in flood inundation maps. Untransformed binary pattern data already have
   been used Within GLUE to estimate domain-averaged (zero-dimensional)
   likelihoods, yet the pattern information embedded within such sources
   has not been used to estimate distributed uncertainty. Where pattern
   information has been used to map distributed uncertainty it has been
   transformed into a continuous function prior to use, which may introduce
   additional errors. To solve this problem we use here `raw' binary
   pattern data to define a zero-dimensional global performance measure for
   each simulation in a Monte Carlo ensemble. Thereafter, for each pixel of
   the distributed model we evaluate the probability that this pixel was
   inundated. This probability is then weighted by the measure of global
   model performance, thus taking into account how well a given parameter
   set performs overall. The result is a distributed uncertainty measure
   mapped over real space. The advantage of the approach is that it both
   captures distributed uncertainty and contains information on global
   likelihood that can be used to condition predictions of further events
   for which observed data are not available. The technique is applied to
   the problem of flood inundation prediction at two test sites
   representing different hydrodynamic conditions. In both cases, the
   method reveals the spatial structure in simulation uncertainty and
   simultaneously enables mapping of flood probability predicted by the
   model. Spatially distributed uncertainty analysis is shown to contain
   information over and above that available from global performance
   measures. Overall, the paper highlights the different types of
   information that may be obtained from mappings of model uncertainty over
   real and n-dimensional parameter spaces. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley

Abstract = {{The primary purpose of this study is to develop regional models of the
   lower part of flow duration curves (LPFDCs) to synthesize low-flow
   characteristics at ungauged sites in southern Taiwan. Because of the
   close relationship between low strearnflow regimes and hydrogeological
   features, the model development first involved delimiting homogeneous
   hydrogeological regions by using two-step cluster analysis. Each
   homogeneous region was then discriminated by an equation developed on
   tire basis of its hydrogeological features, which was then used to
   determine Which of three sets of regional LPFDC models would be
   appropriate for a particular ungauged site. Each of the three sets of
   regional LPFDC models were developed using both conventional
   multivariate statistical regression and fuzzy regression. Thirty-four
   stream-gauged watersheds located in southern Taiwan provide the data
   set. The study results reveal that the regional LPFDC models developed
   in this study could be applied reasonably at ungauged sites. Copyright

Abstract = {{The TOPMODEL framework was used to derive expressions that account for
   saturated and unsaturated flow through shallow soil on a hillslope. The
   resulting equations were the basis for a shallow-soil TOPMODEL
   (STOPMODEL). The common TOPMODEL theory implicitly assumes a water table
   below the entire watershed and this does not conceptually apply to
   systems hydrologically controlled by shallow interflow of perched
   groundwater. STOPMODEL provides an approach for extending TOPMODEL's
   conceptualization to apply to shallow, interflow-driven watersheds by
   using soil moisture deficit instead of water table depth as the state
   variable. Deriving STOPMODEL by using a hydraulic conductivity function
   that changes exponentially with soil moisture content results in
   equations that look very similar to those commonly associated with
   TOPMODEL. This alternative way of conceptualizing TOPMODEL makes the
   modelling approach available to researchers, planners, and engineers who
   work in areas where TOPMODEL was previously believed to be unsuited,
   such as the New York City Watershed in the Catskills region of New York
   State. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The sources of episodic pH decline in four streams from northern Sweden
   during the autumn of 1996 were quantified. The events, in which pH
   dropped by between 1.0 and 2.4 units, were preceded by an extensive
   summer drought. Total organic carbon, which increased 100\% to 160\%
   during peak flow, was the most important driving mechanism of the
   episodic pH decline. Sulphate, however, was relatively more important
   during these autumn events than during spring flood. In the sites where
   past and present anthropogenic deposition were believed to be the main
   source of sulphate in stream water, sulphate contributed less than 0.3
   pH units to the pH decline. In catchments where natural sources of
   sulphate are known to be important, sulphate contributed up to 0.6 units
   of pH decline. The export of sulphate during the episodes was two to
   nine times higher than what was expected from deposition only. The
   drought preceding the study episodes resulted in some of the lowest
   ground water levels during the 1990s in that region. The large export of
   sulphate was probably due to oxidation of natural sulphate bearing
   minerals in the soil and/or previously deposited sulphate driven by the
   low ground water level preceding the episodes. Copyright (C) 2002 John

   major control on all processes of entrainment, transport and deposition.
   The significance of composite suspended sediment particles in glacial
   meltwater streams has, however, not been established. Existing data on
   the particle size characteristics of suspended sediment in glacial
   meltwaters relate to the dispersed mineral fraction (absolute particle
   size), which, for certain size fractions, may bear little relationship
   to the effective or in situ distribution. Existing understanding of
   composite particle formation within freshwater environments would
   suggest that in-stream flocculation processes do not take place in
   glacial meltwater systems because of the absence of organic binding
   agents. However, we report preliminary scanning electron microscopy data
   for one Alpine and two Himalayan glaciers that show composite particles
   are present in the suspended sediment load of the meltwater system. The
   genesis and structure of these composite particles and their constituent
   grain size characteristics are discussed. We present evidence for the
   existence of both aggregates, or composite particles whose features are
   largely inherited from source materials, and flocs, which represent
   composite particles produced by in-stream flocculation processes. In the
   absence of organic materials, the latter may result solely from
   electrochemical flocculation in the meltwater sediment system. This type
   of floc formation has not been reported previously in the freshwater
   fluvial environment. Further work is needed to test the wider
   significance of these data and to investigate the effective particle
   size characteristics of suspended sediment associated with high
   concentration outburst events. Such events make a major contribution to
   suspended sediment fluxes in meltwater streams and may provide
   conditions that are conducive to composite particle formation by
   flocculation. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides an initial characterization of pollution associated
   with storm runoff in Tahiti. A thousand floodwater samples were
   collected from three representative catchments and subsequently
   analysed. The main pollution parameters chosen were total suspended
   sediment (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand
   (BOD5), total nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphorus (TP). First, organic
   pollution appeared to be related closely to sediment, thus TSS could be
   used as a global indicator. Next, regression models between an event's
   TSS load and its hydrological characteristics were used to obtain annual
   load estimates. Great interannual variability was found to be strongly
   influenced by the few major floods that occur during the rainy season.
   Our results also emphasize the importance of the impact of urbanization
   on solid catchment exportation: from 60 TSS t/km(2)/year in it natural
   forested catchment, fluxes reached more than 700 TSS t/km(2)/year during
   preparatory urbanization earthworks before stabilizing at 140 TSS
   t/km(2)/year in a consolidated urbanized area. Clearly, runoff effects
   need to be taken into consideration for effective urban planning and for
   the preservation of the coastal environment in Tahiti. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Two models for estimating expected areal-average infiltration rate, (I)
   over bar, at the hillslope scale are presented. The first relies upon
   the condition of a negligible infiltration of surface water running
   downslope (run-on process) into a previous heterogeneous soil. It is an
   adapted version of an earlier semi-analytical model. The second
   incorporates the run-on process and is based on a Jumped approach that
   uses an effective saturated hydraulic conductivity. This latter was
   parameterized in terms of the main characteristics of rainfall and soil.
   Both the models were tested by comparison with the results carried out
   by Monte-Carlo simulations over different soil types. It was found that
   the first model simulated (I) over bar with maximum errors in magnitude
   typically less than 10\%. The second model provided similar errors in
   the total volume of overland flow, and the rising limb of the hydrograph
   experienced a distortion. Lastly, satisfactory results were obtained by
   comparing the model without run-on with an empirical approach
   particularly accurate for fine-textured soils. Copyright (C) 2002 John

   river}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1771-1791}},
Month = {{JUN 30}},
Abstract = {{Relative to those at sub-bankfull flow, hydraulic conditions at overbank
   flow, whether in the channel or on the floodplain, are poorly
   understood. Here, velocity conditions are analysed over an unusually
   wide range of flows in the and zone river of Cooper Creek with its
   complex system of anastomosing channels and large fluctuations in
   floodplain width. At-a-station hydraulic geometry relationships reveal
   sharp discontinuities in velocity at the inbank-overbank transition, the
   nature of the discontinuity varying with the degree of flow confinement
   and the level of channel-floodplain interaction. However, despite
   inter-sectional differences, velocities remain modest throughout the
   flow range in this low-gradient river, and the large increases in
   at-a-station discharge are principally accommodated by changes in
   cross-sectional area.
   Velocity distribution plots suggest that within-channel conditions
   during overbank flow are characterized by a central band of high
   velocity which penetrates far toward the bed, helping to maintain
   already deep cross-sections. Floodplain resistance along Cooper Creek is
   concentrated at channel bank tops where vegetation density is highest,
   and the subsequent flow retardation is transmitted across the surface of
   the channels over distances as large as 50-70 m. The rough floodplain
   surface affects flood wave transmission, producing significant decreases
   in wave speeds downstream. The character of the wave-speed-discharge
   relationship also changes longitudinally, from log-linear in the upper
   reaches to nonlinear where the floodplain broadens appreciably. The
   nonlinear form is similar in several respects to relationships proposed
   for more humid rivers, with flood wave speed reaching an intermediate
   maximum at about four-fifths bankfull discharge before decreasing to a
   minimum at approximately Q(2.33). It does not regain the value at the
   intermediate maximum until the 10 year flood, by which time floodplain
   depths have become relatively large and broad floodways more active.

Abstract = {{The weathering rate of plagioclase was estimated in the groundwater
   system of a sandy, silicate aquifer formed after the Wisconsin Glacial
   Stage. The study area is an isthmus lying between Crystal and Big
   Muskellunge Lakes in northern Wisconsin, USA. Plagioclase occupies 3\%
   of the quartz and K-feldspar dominated sediments. Groundwater in the
   study area is recharged in part by precipitation through the isthmus
   soils and in part by seepage from Crystal Lake, which is of low ionic
   strength and chemically in steady state. Water analysis revealed that
   the chemistry of groundwater recharged from Crystal Lake is regulated by
   mineral dissolution reactions. The rate constant for plagioclase was
   estimated using mass balances for sodium concentrations along a
   groundwater flowline from Crystal Lake. For this calculation, various
   kinds of hydrological/mineralogical information were used: groundwater
   flow path from oxygen isotope analysis, groundwater travel times from
   flow modelling, mineral composition from microprobe analysis and surface
   area of minerals from BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) analysis. The overall
   range of the estimation was less than an order of magnitude (3.5 x
   10(-16) to 3.4 x 10(-15) mol/m(2)/s). The result is up to three orders
   of magnitude slower than the previous field estimates, which applied
   geometric methods in measuring mineral surface areas. However, this
   result is somewhat higher than the estimates reported by other BET
   area-based studies, which were undertaken on soil profiles having
   different hydrological conditions. This rate difference is interpreted
   as a result of higher mineral reactivity owing to younger sediment age.
   The rate difference is smaller when this result is compared with the
   estimates from the soils of similar age, indicating that the differences
   in hydrological condition are not sufficient to explain the weathering
   rate discrepancy between the laboratory and field studies, which is up
   to five orders of magnitude. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated using Monte Carlo simulation the interaction
   between a linear trend and a lag-one autoregressive (AR(1)) process when
   both exist in a time series. Simulation experiments demonstrated that
   the existence of serial correlation alters the variance of the estimate
   of the Mann-Kendall (MK) statistic; and the presence of a trend alters
   the estimate of the magnitude of serial correlation. Furthermore, it was
   shown that removal of a positive serial correlation component from time
   series by pre-whitening resulted in a reduction in the magnitude of the
   existing trend; and the removal of a trend component from a time series
   as a first step prior to pre-whitening eliminates the influence of the
   trend on the serial correlation and does not seriously affect the
   estimate of the true AR(1). These results indicate that the commonly
   used pre-whitening procedure for eliminating the effect of serial
   correlation on the MK test leads to potentially inaccurate assessments
   of the significance of a trend; and certain procedures will be more
   appropriate for eliminating the impact of serial correlation on the MK
   test. In essence, it was advocated that a trend first be removed in a
   series prior to ascertaining the magnitude of serial correlation. This
   alternative approach and the previously existing approaches were
   employed to assess the significance of a trend in serially correlated
   annual mean and annual minimum streamflow data of some pristine river
   basins in Ontario, Canada. Results indicate that, with the previously
   existing procedures, researchers and practitioners may have incorrectly
   identified the possibility of significant trends. Copyright (C) 2002

Abstract = {{A method for estimation of mean baseflow residence time in watersheds
   from hydrograph runoff recession characteristics was developed. Runoff
   recession characteristics were computed for the period 1993-96 in the 2
   km(2) Winnisook watershed, Catskill Mountains, southeastern New York,
   and were used to derive mean values of subsurface hydraulic conductivity
   and the storage coefficient. These values were then used to estimate the
   mean baseflow residence time from an expression of the soil contact
   time, based on watershed soil and topographic characteristics. For
   comparison, mean baseflow residence times were calculated for the same
   period of time through the traditional convolution integral approach,
   which relates rainfall delta(18)O to delta(18)O values in streamflow.
   Our computed mean baseflow residence time was 9 months by both methods.
   These results indicate that baseflow residence time can be calculated
   accurately using recession analysis, and the method is less expensive
   than using environmental and/or artificial tracers. Published in (C)

Abstract = {{There is a growing awareness that water will be one of the most critical
   natural resources and that there is a need for better management of the
   limited water resources. This paper reports on a study of a water-scarce
   river basin in western Turkey. Hydrological analyses, emphasizing water
   use for irrigation, are performed at three different spatial scales
   (field scale, irrigation scheme scale and basin scale) using two kind of
   model: a parametric basin-scale model and a physically based crop-scale
   model. Data accessibility for this basin, especially for areal data, was
   low. A combined use of public domain data sets and remotely sensed data
   was used to solve this problem. A public domain digital elevation model
   was used to generate the streamflow network and the distances and slopes
   to streams. Land-cover data and leaf area index data were derived from
   public domain NOAA-AVHRR images. For one irrigation scheme in the basin,
   detailed areal water balances were obtained from the simulation model
   and a comparison was made between a normal and a water-short year. At
   the basin scale, observed flows were compared with simulated flows. It
   is concluded that remotely sensed data and other public domain data can
   be used with simulation models at different scales to create a powerful
   tool to evaluate water resources in a basin context. Copyright (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Passive microwave brightness temperatures of snowpacks depend not only
   on the snow depth, but also on the internal snowpack properties,
   particularly the grain size, which changes through the winter.
   Algorithms that assume a constant grain size can yield erroneous
   estimates of snow depth or water equivalent. For snowpacks that are
   subject to temperatures well below freezing, the bulk temperature
   gradient through the snowpack controls the metamorphosis of the snow
   grains. This study used National Weather Service (NWS) station
   measurements of snow depth and air temperature from the Northern US
   Great Plains to determine temporal and spatial variability of the snow
   depth and bulk snowpack temperature gradient. This region is well suited
   for this study because it consists primarily of open farmland or
   prairie, has little relief, is subject to very cold temperatures, and
   has more than 280 reporting stations. A geostatistical technique called
   Kriging was used to grid the randomly spaced snow depth measurements.
   The resulting snow depth maps were then compared with the passive
   microwave observations from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I).
   Two snow seasons were examined: 1988-89, a typical snow year, and
   1996-97, a record year for snow that was responsible for extensive
   flooding in the Red River Basin. Inspection of the time series of snow
   depth and microwave spectral gradient (the difference between the 19 and
   37 GHz bands) showed that while the snowpack was constant, the spectral
   gradient continued to increase. However, there was a strong correlation
   (0.6 < R-2 < 0.9) between the spectral gradient and the cumulative bulk
   temperature gradient through the snowpack (TGI). Hence, TGI is an index
   of grain size metamorphism that has occurred within the snowpack. TGI
   time series from 21 representative sites across the region and the
   corresponding SSM/I observations were used to develop an algorithm for
   snow depth that requires daily air temperatures. Copyright (C) 2002 John

Abstract = {{The Peace-Athabasca Delta, Canada, is a 3900 km(2) freshwater wetland
   complex, characterized by numerous river channels, lakes and wetland
   basins. Periodic flooding of the wetland basins is necessary to maintain
   the productivity in the delta. The delta experienced a 22 year drying
   trend between 1974 and 1996, resulting in considerable changes in water
   boundaries. Availability of water is the dominant mechanism driving the
   ecosystem response. As such, accurate and frequently updated maps of
   floodwater extent and vegetation types are necessary for proper wetland
   management. Owing to the large size, remoteness, and dynamic nature of
   the delta, flood mapping is only feasible using remote sensing.
   This paper evaluates the use of radar and visible/infrared satellite
   imagery for mapping the extent of flooded wetland areas. The extent of
   standing water in the delta during May 1996 and May 1998 was mapped
   using RADARSAT and SPOT imagery. The RADARSAT scenes, the SPOT scenes,
   and a combination of the two were, for each year, classified into open
   water, flooded vegetation, and non-flooded land using a Mahalanobis
   distance classifier. When the 1996 RADARSAT scene and the 1996 SPOT
   scene were classified separately, they resulted in Kappa coefficients of
   70\% and 66\% respectively. The accuracy increased to 92\% when the
   RADARSAT and the SPOT scenes were combined and classified together.
   Classification of the 1998 RADARSAT scene and the 1998 SPOT scene
   resulted in accuracies of 76\% and 80\% respectively, whereas a
   combination of the two scenes resulted in an accuracy of 92\%. The
   results from this study indicate that the information from radar and
   visible/infrared satellite imagery is complementary and that flood
   mapping in wetland areas can be achieved with higher accuracy if the two
   image types are used in combination. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{The snowmelt runoff model (SRM) is used to simulate and forecast the
   daily discharge of several basins of the Spanish Pyrenees. We describe a
   method for snow mapping using NOAA-AVHRR data and a procedure to
   estimate retrospectively the accumulated snow water equivalent volume
   with the SRM. A linear combination of NOAA channels 1 and 2 is used to
   obtain a snow cover image in which the product is the percentage of the
   snow-covered area in each pixel. Real-time snowmelt forecasts are
   generated with the SRM using area snow cover as an input variable. Even
   in basins with a total absence of historical discharge and
   meteorological data, the SRM provides an estimation of the daily
   snowmelt discharge. By integrating the forecasted streamflow over the
   recession streamflow, snowmelt volume is obtained as a function of time.
   This function converges asymptotically to the net stored volume of water
   equivalent of the snowpack. Plotting this integral as a function of
   time, it is possible to estimate for each basin both the melted snow
   water equivalent (SWE) and the SWE remaining in storage at any point in
   the snowmelt season Spanish hydropower companies are using results from
   the SRM to improve water resource management. Copyright (C) 2002 John

Abstract = {{To map water levels related to large floods, we propose using
   geographical information systems to manage the vast amount of
   information extracted from aerial photographs. Our approach is divided
   into three parts: (1) segmentation of the flood plain into sectors with
   acceptable mean water depth, based on geographical limits and size
   criteria; (2) determination of minimum and maximum depths for each
   sector, based on the potential emergence of natural objects (vegetation,
   dikes, etc.); (3) improvement of water depth assessment, using all
   observed hydraulic connections between sectors (cracked dikes, flows,
   etc.). This advance is made possible by solving a constraint system
   linking the different estimated water levels. This method was applied to
   the November 1994 flood involving the Herault River (France), using
   aerial photographs taken 10 h after the flood peak. Results indicate an
   accurate estimation of water levels, and illustrate the lateral dynamic
   behaviour of the flood (1 m of difference in levels between centre and
   edges of plain), and the impact of dikes on water levels. These results
   were obtained without using either general hydraulic equations or local
   head loss coefficients. The great quantity of fuzzy information made up
   for its poor quality. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature indices from NOAA-AVHRR data were developed to predict
   diurnal and seasonal streamflow in Taylor Valley, Antarctica. Masks of
   the primary land-cover types (snow, glacier ice, lake ice, and soils)
   were created from Landsat TM data using binary threshold methods. The
   masks were then scaled to AVHRR resolution using modal selection of
   pixels and applied to both diurnal and seasonal time series of AVHRR
   temperature data from the 1994-95 austral summer season. A temperature
   area index (TAI) was calculated for different land-cover types, as well
   as for the entire watershed. The TAI was defined as the number of pixels
   at or above a specified temperature. Diurnal discharge was well
   characterized by a linear relationship of streamflow to the TAI using a
   temperature threshold of 259 K from all land class pixels for lower
   Taylor Valley. Neither index successfully predicted seasonal discharge,
   most likely due to the mismatch of time scales between the satellite and
   streamflow data. The TAI has great potential for predicting diurnal

Abstract = {{Rainfall monitoring is a regular activity of food security analysts for
   sub-Saharan Africa due to the potentially disastrous impact of drought.
   Crop water accounting schemes are used to track rainfall timing and
   amounts relative to phenological requirements, to infer water limitation
   impacts on yield. Unfortunately, many rain gauge reports are available
   only after significant delays, and the gauge locations leave large gaps
   in coverage. As an alternative, a grid-cell-based formulation for the
   water requirement satisfaction index (WRSI) was tested for maize in
   Southern Africa. Grids of input variables were obtained from remote
   sensing estimates of rainfall, meteorological models, and digital soil
   maps. The spatial WRSI was computed for the 1996-97 and 1997-98 growing
   seasons. Maize yields were estimated by regression and compared with a
   limited number of reports from the field for the 1996-97 season in
   Zimbabwe. Agreement at a useful level (r = 0.80) was observed. This is
   comparable to results from traditional analysis with station data. The
   findings demonstrate the complementary role that remote sensing,
   modelling, and geospatial analysis can play in an era when field data
   collection in sub-Saharan Africa is suffering an unfortunate decline.

Abstract = {{Results from an investigation on the evaluation of RADARSAT (C-HH)
   imagery for monitoring ice growth and decay, and related processes of
   shallow sub-Arctic (tundra and forest) lakes in northern Manitoba,
   Canada, are presented. Field observations on the structural and
   stratigraphic characteristics of snow and ice from four lake sites are
   used in support of the interpretation of changes in synthetic aperture
   radar backscatter intensity as a function of time and incidence angle
   (20-49degrees). Results show that bubble inclusions, most of which are
   tubular and oriented in the direction of growth, strongly influence
   backscatter intensity from floating ice in RADARSAT Standard beam mode
   imagery. It is shown that radar return can vary considerably as a
   function of incidence angle. Differences of as much as 6.5 dB were
   observed for the same ice cover when observed at steeper (20-35degrees)
   compared with shallower (35-49degrees) incidence angles. During the
   early stages of ice growth and/or when the ice volume contains a small
   amount of tubular bubbles, backscatter intensity from the floating ice
   measured at shallower incidence angles (35-49degrees) is similar to that
   observed from the grounded ice at any incidence angle (-17 to -11 dB). A
   strong decrease in backscatter was observed at all sites during spring
   thaw and was explained by the microwave signal being absorbed by the wet
   snow cover and by specular reflection from the standing water (ponds) on
   the lake ice surface. With its multiple beam mode configurations,
   RADARSAT offers an improved temporal coverage over ERS-1/2, thus making
   it possible to determine more precisely freeze-up and break-up dates,
   and timing of bottom freezing from shallow Arctic and sub-Arctic lakes.

Pages = {{1645-1662}},

Abstract = {{A key state variable in land surface-atmosphere interactions is soil
   moisture, which affects surface energy fluxes, runoff and the radiation
   balance. Soil moisture modelling relies on parameter estimates that are
   inadequately measured at the necessarily fine model scales. Hence, model
   soil moisture estimates are imperfect and often drift away from reality
   through simulation time. Because of its spatial and temporal nature,
   remote sensing holds great promise for soil moisture estimation. Much
   success has been attained in recent years in soil moisture estimation
   using passive and active microwave sensors, but progress has been slow.
   One reason for this is the scale disparity between remote sensing data
   resolution and the hydrologic process scale. Other impediments include
   vegetation cover and microwave penetration depth. As a result, currently
   there is no comprehensive method for assimilating remote soil moisture
   observations within a surface hydrology model at watershed or larger
   scales.
   This paper describes a measurement-modelling system for estimating the
   three-dimensional soil moisture distribution, incorporating remote
   microwave observations, a surface flux-soil moisture model, a radiative
   transfer model and Kalman filtering. The surface model, driven by
   meteorological observations, estimates the vertical and lateral
   distribution of water. Based on the model soil moisture profiles,
   microwave brightness temperatures are estimated using the radiative
   transfer model. A Kalman filter is then applied using modelled and
   observed brightness temperatures to update the model soil moisture
   profile.
   The modelling system has been applied using data from the Southern Great
   Plains 1997 field experiment. In the presence of highly inaccurate
   rainfall input, assimilation of remote microwave data results in better
   agreement with observed soil moisture. Without assimilation, it was seen
   that the model near-surface soil moisture reached a minimum that was
   higher than observed, resulting in substantial errors during very dry
   conditions. Updating moisture profiles daily with remotely sensed
   brightness temperatures reduced but did not eliminate this bias.

Abstract = {{Water use by vegetation can be closely linked to streamflow patterns on
   a variety of time scales. However, many of the details of these linkages
   are poorly understood. We compared diel (24 h) patterns of
   transpirational water use with streamflow patterns in a small headwater
   basin that displays a marked diel variation during summer months. The
   study site was in western Oregon. Our objectives were to: (1) determine
   the phase shift, i.e. the time lag between maximum transpiration and
   minimum streamflow, and the strength of the correlation at that time
   lag; (2) determine the amount of streamflow that is `missing' during
   each diel cycle (i.e. the difference between base flow, defined by the
   daily maxima, and actual flow) and use it to estimate the zone, or area,
   of vegetation that influences daily streamflow patterns; (3) test and
   refine a conceptual model of how the coupling between vegetation water
   use and streamflow changes over the period of summer drought in this
   basin. We found that vegetation water use in the summer is coupled to
   streamflow over time scales of 4 to 8 h, and water-use-related
   fluctuations accounted for 1 to 6\% of summer base flow. Direct
   evaporation from the channel was an order of magnitude less than the
   diel streamflow decrease. Transpiration within only 0.1 to 0.3\% of the
   basin area accounted for the diel variation in streamflow. As the basin
   drained further through the summer, the coupling between vegetation and
   streamflow was diminished and occurred at longer time scales, and the
   zone of vegetation influence became smaller. This pattern is in
   accordance with our conceptual model, which attributes the summer
   decline in the strength of the vegetation-streamflow coupling to the
   increasing depth of plant-available water in the soil profile. Although
   this study is preliminary, we believe it is an important first step in
   describing better the coupling of vegetation water use to streamflow.

Abstract = {{We sampled river water at 13 locations in the Pichis basin, a 10500
   km(2) large rainforest-covered drainage basin in Peru, to assess the
   influence of lithological variability and seasonality on water
   chemistry. The concentrations of major cations and silica show a strong
   seasonal dependence and a remarkable variability over short distances
   that is only weakly reduced in the wet season; cation concentrations in
   streams differ by up to 100\% within a few kilometres. The lowest cation
   concentrations were associated with relatively cation-depleted upper
   Tertiary and lower Quaternary formations, whereas relatively cation-rich
   lower Tertiary and Jurassic formations left a clear calcium and sodium
   signal in the respective rivers. Cluster analysis, in conjunction with
   boxplots, suggests that the sampling locations can be segregated into
   three groups based on similarities of their geochemical signals.
   According to the previously defined criteria, one river is classified as
   a Group 2 river with 200 < TZ+ < 450 mueq/L, whereas all other rivers
   fall into Group 3 with 450 < TZ+ < 3000 mueq/L (where TZ+ refers to the
   total cation charge). Based on a comparison with other studies at
   different sections of the Amazon mainstem, the river chemistry of our
   study area is relatively enriched in K(+), Mg(2+) and Ca(2+), and,
   consequently, has a higher TZ+ value, while being relatively depleted in
   silica. The influence of lithological variability on water chemistry
   must be considered in land-use change studies even at watershed areas of
   26-3382 km(2). Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The areal infiltration behaviour of a grass field is studied using a
   data set of 78 sprinkler infiltration experiments. The analysis of the
   experimental data shows a distinct event dependency: once runoff begins,
   the final infiltration rate increases with increasing rainfall
   intensity. This behaviour is attributed to the effects of small-scale
   variability. Increasing rainfall intensity increases the ponded area and
   therefore the portion of the plot which infiltrates at maximum rate. To
   describe the areal infiltration behaviour of the grass field the study
   uses two different model structures and investigates different
   approaches for consideration of sub-rid variability. It is found that
   the effective parameter approach is not suited for this purpose. A good
   representation of the observed behaviour is obtained by using a
   distribution function approach or a parameterization approach. However,
   it is not clear how the parameters can be derived for these two
   approaches without a large measurement campaign. The data analysis and
   the simulations show the great importance of considering the effects of
   spatial variability for the infiltration process. This may be
   significant even at a small scale for a comparatively homogeneous area.
   The consideration of heterogeneity seems to be more important than the
   choice of the model type. Furthermore, similar results may be obtained
   with different modelling approaches. Even the relatively detailed data
   set does not seem to permit a clear model choice. In view of these
   results it is questionable to use very complex and detailed simulation
   models given the approximate nature of the problem. Although the
   principle processes may be well understood there is a lack of models
   that represent these processes and, more importantly, there is a lack of
   techniques to measure and parameterize them. Copyright (C) 2002 John

Abstract = {{This study focuses mainly on observing urban development in Taiwan's
   Wu-Tu watershed from the perspective of urban hydrological theory. An
   approach is proposed for developing a method for incorporating available
   meteorological data to define the degree of change in a runoff
   hydrograph for urbanizing basins. The mean rainfall was estimated using
   the Kriging method. For calibration, two methods of calculating the
   effective rainfall (the phi-index method and the non-linear-programming
   (NLP) method) were used as model inputs, and the optimal global
   parameters of the linear reservoir model were then obtained from the
   shuffled complex evolution (SCE) algorithm. Twenty-six (1966-1991) and
   eight (1994-1997) rainfall-runoff events were used for calibration and
   verification, respectively. The NLP method yielded better results than
   the phi-index method, especially for multipeak rainfall-runoff events.
   The regression equation determined the relationship between the
   parameters of the model and impervious areas. A comparison based on the
   results of the instantaneous unit hydrograph of the study area revealed
   that three decades of urbanization had increased the peak flow by 27\%,
   and the time to peak was decreased by 4 h. The study simply describes
   the results of the impact of imperviousness on hydrological modelling.

Abstract = {{This paper presents measurements of the energy balance (radiation,
   sensible heat flux, evaporation) from a sub-arctic hillside in northern
   Finland for a summer season. Comparisons are also made with a nearby
   wetland site. The hillslope measurements show an equal partition of the
   radiant energy into sensible and latent heat flux. The evaporative ratio
   of just over one half was remarkably constant throughout the season,
   despite very large day-to-day and diurnal variations of temperature,
   humidity deficit and radiation input. This conservative behaviour of the
   evaporation was caused by a strong rise in effective surface resistance
   to evaporation with increasing vapour pressure deficit. This suggests a
   strong physiological control on the evaporation, with stomata closing at
   times of high evaporative demand. There was no obvious impact of
   soil-water stress on the evaporation. However, a comparison with the
   evaporation measured at a nearby mire site in 1997 suggests that the
   mire has a significantly lower surface resistance, even when the impact
   of a significantly lower humidity deficit in the earlier year is taken
   into account.
   The measurements are used to test, off-line, the performance of MOSES
   (Meteorological Office Surface Exchange Scheme), a simple, but
   comprehensive, land surface model. The sensitivity of the energy
   exchanges to the thermal properties of the top soil layer (a surrogate
   for the upper soil/vegetation layer) is investigated with the use of the
   model. It is found that the evaporation is insensitive to these
   properties; they do, however, influence the partition of energy between
   the sensible heat flux and the ground heat flux (and hence the soil
   temperatures). It is suggested that the model needs to represent the
   thermal properties of the canopy more realistically. Copyright (C) 2002

Abstract = {{A simple model for estimating likely spatial patterns in landscape-scale
   denitrification rates is described. In the absence of limiting nitrate
   concentration, denitrification is assumed to be controlled principally
   by the soil water regime and the amount of available soil carbon. A
   formulation of TOPMODEL is used to estimate the spatial distribution of
   water table depths. Soil carbon concentration is assumed to decrease
   exponentially with depth. The spatial distribution of carbon
   concentrations at the soil surface is assumed to be imperfectly
   correlated with the topographic index used in TOPMODEL. Monte Carlo
   simulation techniques were used to introduce a stochastic element to the
   spatial distribution of soil carbon. This allowed estimates of the
   uncertainty in model outputs, resulting from uncertainties in the
   distribution and variability of soil carbon to be made. The model
   predicted spatial and temporal patterns of nitrate-non-limiting
   denitrification for a 15 year period in the Slapton Wood catchment in
   southwest England. Predicted denitrification followed a slight seasonal
   pattern with a winter maximum. Total annual denitrification losses
   tended to be positively correlated with total annual precipitation in
   the catchment. Highest rates tended to be predicted near to the stream.
   The modelling approach provides a means of assessing the proximity of
   local-scale field measurements to probable landscape-scale
   denitrification fluxes. Combining a deterministic model core with a
   stochastic generation of model parameters or state variables provides an
   attractive way of embracing variability and uncertainty whilst
   maintaining a conceptual description of the system dynamics. Copyright

Abstract = {{Streamflow time series in and and semi-arid regions can be characterized
   as a sequence of single discrete flow episodes or clusters of
   hydrographs separated by periods of zero discharge. Here, two point
   process models are presented for the joint occurrence of flow events at
   neighbouring river sites. The first allows for excess clustering by
   adding autocorrelated errors to an empirically derived seasonally
   varying probability of an event and is extended to the case of the joint
   occurrence of flow events in two catchments. The second approach is to
   explicitly model the occurrences of clusters of events and the bivariate
   point process of event occurrences within them at both sites. For the
   two models, the magnitude of event peaks are assumed to be drawn from
   continuous distributions with seasonally varying parameters. Rises and
   recessions in discharge are interpolated between the peaks using
   regression estimates of hydrographs. The models are fitted to mean daily
   flows at two sites in Namibia and demonstrated to provide realistic
   simulations of the hydrology, Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Intensities and amounts of water infiltration and runoff on sloping land
   are governed by the rainfall pattern and soil hydraulic conductivity, as
   well as by the microtopography and soil surface conditions. These
   components are closely interrelated and occur simultaneously, and their
   particular contribution may change during a rainfall event, or their
   effects may vary at different field scales. The scale effect on the
   process of infiltration/runoff was studied under natural field and
   rainfall conditions for two plot sizes: small plots of 0.25 m(2) and
   large plots of 50 m(2). The measurements were carried out in the central
   region of Chile in a piedmont most recently used as natural pastureland.
   Three blocks, each having one large plot and five small plots, were
   established. Cumulative rainfall and runoff quantities were sampled
   every 5 min. Significant variations in runoff responses to rainfall
   rates were found for the two plot sizes. On average, large plots yielded
   only 40\% of runoff quantities produced on small plots per unit area.
   This difference between plot sizes was observed even during periods of
   continuous runoff. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Using kinematic wave equations, analytical solutions are derived for
   flow due to a storm moving up or down an infiltrating plane and covering
   it completely. The storm duration is assumed in two ways. First, the
   plane is covered everywhere for the same duration by the storm. Second,
   the plane is covered in a linearly decreasing manner from the beginning
   of its coverage of the plane to the other end of the plane. By comparing
   the flow due to this storm with that due to a stationary storm of the
   same duration, the influence of storm duration, direction and velocity
   on flow hydrograph is investigated. It is found that storm movement has
   a pronounced effect on runoff hydrograph. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley

Abstract = {{As a large and dynamic land-use category, tropical secondary forests may
   affect climate, soils, and hydrology in a manner different from primary
   forests or agricultural areas. We investigated the saturated hydraulic
   conductivity K-sat of a Kandiudult under different land uses in
   Rondonia, Brazil. We measured K-sat at four depths (12.5, 20, 30 and 50
   cm) under (a) primary forest, (b) a former banana-cacao plantation
   (SF1), and (c) an abandoned pasture (SF2). At 12.5 cm, all three land
   uses differ significantly (alpha = 0.1), but not at the 20 and 30 cm
   depths. At 50 cm, K-sat was significantly greater in the former pasture
   than in other land uses. Lateral subsurface flow is expected during
   intense rainfall (about 30 times per year) at 30 cm depth in SF1 and at
   50 em depth in the forest, whereas the relatively low permeability at
   shallow 12.5 cm in the SF2 may result not only in lateral subsurface
   flow, but also saturation overland flow. For modelling purposes,
   recovering systems seem to have Ksat values distinct from primary forest
   at shallow depths, whereas at deeper layers (>20 cm) they may be
   considered similar to forests. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The issues of downscaling the results from global climate models (GCMs)
   to a scale relevant for hydrological impact studies are examined. GCM
   outputs, typically at a spatial resolution of around 3degrees latitude
   and 4degrees longitude, are currently not considered reliable at time
   scales shorter than I month. Continuous rainfall-runoff modelling for
   flood regime assessment requires input at the daily or even hourly
   time-step. A review of the different methodologies suggested in the
   literature to downscale GCM results at smaller spatial and temporal
   resolutions is presented. The methods, from simple interpolation to more
   sophisticated dynamical modelling, through multiple regression and
   weather generators, are, however, mostly based directly on GCM outputs,
   sometimes at daily time-step. The approach adopted is a simple,
   empirical methodology based on modelled monthly changes from the HadCM2
   greenhouse gases experiment for the time horizon 2050s. Three daily
   rainfall scenarios are derived from the same set of monthly changes,
   representing different possible changes in the rainfall regime. The
   first scenario represents an increase of the occurrence of frontal
   systems, corresponding to a decrease in the rainfall intensity; the
   second corresponds to an increase in convective storm-type rainfall,
   characterized by extreme events with higher intensity; the third one
   assumes an increase in the monthly rainfall without any change in
   rainfall variability. A continuous daily rainfall-runoff model,
   calibrated for the Severn catchment, was used to generate daily flow
   series for the 1961-90 baseline period and the 2050s, and a
   peaks-over-threshold analysis was undertaken to produce flood frequency
   distributions for the two time horizons. Though the three scenarios lead
   to an increase in the magnitude and the frequency of the extreme flood
   events, the impact is strongly influenced by the type of daily rainfall
   scenario applied. We conclude that if the next generation of GCMs
   produce more reliable rainfall variance estimates, then more appropriate
   ways of deriving rainfall scenarios could be developed using weather
   generators rather than empirical methods. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Long-term simulations of temporal rainfall and temperature under
   transient global climate conditions are discussed to give an insight
   into potential modifications of atmospheric inputs at the basin scale in
   the Arno River in central Italy. The outputs from a global circulation
   model (GCM), simulating climate changes due to an increase in the
   greenhouse effect resulting from a continuous trend in the growth of CO2
   atmospheric concentration and accounting for the influence of both CO2
   and sulphate aerosols, are downscaled using a stochastic approach based
   on the observed nonstationarity of precipitation and temperature
   patterns. By using the historical joint variability of the internal
   structure of storm events, one can infer future changes in storm
   duration and depth from GCM trend variables, thus indicating the extent
   of changes in the occurrence of wet and dry periods and in the daily
   rates, including those of distributional properties at the monthly and
   annual scales. Because the changes detected mainly affect the tails of
   the distributions, one can conclude that modifications can occur in both
   low and high values of rainfall at the monthly and annual scales, with a
   shift of the storm patterns towards shorter and more intense convective
   rainfall, especially in the summer season. Stochastic simulation also
   shows that the distributional and scaling properties of rainfall
   extremes may progressively change, thus indicating that some revision of
   current practices to estimate extreme storms is needed to account for
   possible effects of non-stationary climate conditions, This approach
   provides local precipitation that, together with temperature scenarios,
   can be used for hydrological simulation of basin water fluxes in the
   Arno River, as reported in a companion paper (Burlando P, Rosso R.

Abstract = {{Potential climate change is expected to produce substantial effects on
   the hydrological cycle. In a companion paper (Burlando P, Rosso R.
   Hydrological Processes this issue) the effects on precipitation have
   been discussed, with particular attention being given to significant
   changes in storm characteristics, distributional and extremal
   properties. As a consequence, major changes in runoff and
   rainfall-driven processes could occur, The analysis of such changes is
   discussed in this paper, focusing on the Arno River basin, central
   Italy, which can be representative of climatic environments of southern
   Europe. The effects of transient scenarios are simulated by a model that
   explicitly describes the processes involved in the rainfall-runoff
   transformation. Changes in the most significant components of the water
   balance are discussed with respect to seasonality, distributional
   properties and extremes. Finally, mention is also given to some
   potential implications on water resources. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Analysing the impact of future climate change on hydrological regimes is
   hampered by the disparity of scales between general circulation model
   (GCM) output and the spatial resolution required by catchment-scale
   hydrological simulation models. In order to overcome this, statistical
   relationships were established between three indices of atmospheric
   circulation (vorticity and the strength and direction of geostrophic
   windflow) and daily catchment precipitation and potential
   evapotranspiration (PET) to downscale from the HadCM2 GCM to the Upper
   Wye experimental catchment in mid-Wales. The atmospheric circulation
   indices were calculated from daily grid point sea-level pressure data
   for: (a) the Climatic Research Unit observed data set (1975-90); (b) the
   HadCM2SUL simulation representing the present climate (1980-99); and (c)
   the HadCM2SUL simulation representing future climate conditions
   (2080-99). The performance of the downscaling approach was evaluated by
   comparing diagnostic statistics from the three downscaled precipitation
   and PET scenarios with those recorded from the Upper Wye catchment. The
   most significant changes between the downscaled HadCM2SUL 1980-99 and
   2080-99 scenarios are decreases in precipitation occurrence and amount
   in summer and autumn combined with a shortening of mean wet spell
   length, which is most pronounced in autumn. A hydrological simulation
   model (HYSIM) was calibrated on recorded flow data for the Upper Wye
   catchment and `forced' with the three downscaled precipitation and PET
   scenarios to model changes in river flow and hillslope hydrological
   processes. Results indicate increased seasonality of flows, with
   markedly drier summers. Analysis of extreme events suggests significant
   increases in the frequency of both high- and low-flow events. Copyright

Abstract = {{This paper explores the use of synoptic-scale predictor variables to
   downscale both high- and low-frequency components of daily precipitation
   at sites across the British Isles. Part I investigates seasonal and
   inter-annual variations in three weather generator parameters with
   respect to concurrent variations in a North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
   index and area-average sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. Marked
   spatial gradients were found in the strength of the associated
   correlation fields using rainfall data for the period 1961-90. For
   example, the persistence of winter wet-spells was most strongly
   correlated with the NAO index in NW Scotland, and the persistence of
   autumn dryspells with SST anomalies in SE England. At such locations,
   North Atlantic conditioning accounted for over 40\% of the inter-annual
   variability of precipitation occurrence. In Part II, three downscaling
   models were compared using independent daily precipitation data for
   sites located in the regions of strongest North Atlantic forcing. The
   parameters of Model M were implicitly conditioned by three regional
   airflow indices; the parameters of Model X were explicitly conditioned
   by either the NAO index or SST anomalies and daily vorticity; and the
   parameters of Model U (a threeparameter stochastic rainfall model) were
   unconditional. Overall, the conditional models displayed greater skill
   for monthly rainfall statistics relative to Model U (the control), but
   still did not completely remove overdispersion. On comparing Models M
   and X, it was evident that explicit conditioning did bestow additional
   advantages for the chosen sites and seasons of greatest forcing.
   However, further research is required to determine the generality of
   these results for other regions and periods of the rainfall record.

Abstract = {{This paper presents the likely impacts of climate change on runoff,
   evapotranspiration and soil moisture in the more populated and important
   agricultural regions of Australia. The impacts are estimated by
   comparing the water fluxes simulated by a hydrologic model using present
   climate data and greenhouse-enhanced climate scenarios predicted by
   general circulation models. The results indicate that changes in
   rainfall are amplified in runoff. In wet and temperate catchments the
   percentage change in runoff is about twice the percentage change in
   rainfall, whereas in ephemeral catchments with low runoff coefficients
   the percentage change in runoff can be more than four times the
   percentage change in rainfall. The modelling study estimates that the
   annual runoffs in catchments on the northeast coast and east coast of
   Australia could change by -5 to +15\% and +/-15\% respectively by the
   year 2030. The annual runoff in southeast Australia could decrease by up
   to 20\%, and in Tasmania a +/-10\% change in runoff by 2030 is possible.
   The model simulates a decrease in the annual runoff in catchments in the
   South Australian Gulf of up to 25\% by 2030, and a change of -25\% to
   +10\% in the runoff on the southwest coast of Australia. Although there
   are large uncertainties in these estimates, the results show the
   potential for climate change to bring about runoff modifications that
   may require a significant planning response. Copyright (C) 2002 John

Abstract = {{The countries of western South America are heavily dependent upon their
   water resources and are subjected to considerable interannual
   variability in precipitation and streamflow. Many of these extremes,
   both high and low, are shown to be associated with the various aspects
   of atmosphere-ocean behaviour in the eastern and central Pacific, which
   are collectively termed El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO itself
   constitutes a complex of environmental changes that have differing
   influences throughout the study area, but which are loosely associated,
   statistically and physically, with the major regional
   precipitation-generating mechanisms. As the result of a non-linear
   chaotic system, no two ENSO events are the same, nor are their
   interactions with other regional climatic factors and the state of the
   continental hydrologic system, both of which may act to dampen or
   amplify any changes. However, statistical evidence suggests that
   probabilistic forecasts are possible based either upon anticipated state
   of the atmosphere-ocean arbitrarily classified according to some a
   priori classification scheme or upon forecasted sea surface
   temperatures. Examples of the changing probability distributions of
   hydro-climatological variables in the study area suggest that some
   practical information of value may be extracted. Copyright (C) 2002 John

Abstract = {{A comprehensive analysis of the extreme rainfalls in Tuscany, Italy, is
   carried out with the aim of understanding and quantifying the
   uncertainties connected with the estimation of the design storms, which
   is very important for a sound basin management at urban or larger
   scales. The historical extreme rainfall series of durations 1, 3, 6, 12
   and 24 h collected at 81 rain gauges located at representative sites in
   Tuscany are computed to detect a possible trend by means of two tests:
   the Pearson linear correlation coefficient and the Mann-Kendall test.
   The generalized extreme value distribution is employed to compute design
   storms with a 30 years return period; hence a preliminary map of the
   most hazardous areas is built up. The design storms are then computed
   for several consecutive 20 year moving time windows (1 year step) to
   evaluate intrinsic (climatological) uncertainties in the series. A
   regionalization of the difference between the design storms calculated
   for different periods is performed. The hydrological consequences of
   this kind of climate variability are demonstrated to have a major impact
   on the design of hydraulic works in a basin. Copyright (C) 2002 John

Abstract = {{The disastrous flood that occurred in the southern area of Piedmont
   (north-western Italy) at the beginning of November 1994 was associated
   with heavy rainfall episodes over a relatively small area in a course of
   events spanning the period 3-6 November 1994. The most intense rainfall
   (for which values over 200 mm were reported) occurred in two regions
   located in the upper reach of the Tanaro and Bormida river basins
   (Maritime Alps) and over the north-west sector of the Alps. The
   distribution of rainfall intensities was different in the two areas
   where the precipitation peaks were observed. In the former, almost all
   rainfall was concentrated between the 4 and 5 November; in the second,
   rainfall was intense but spread over the entire period. The intense
   rainfall over these two mountain areas was enhanced by the confluence of
   the surface south-easterly flow and of the upper-level southerly
   current. This confluence was strongest over the two zones in which the
   maxima of rainfall and vertical wind velocity were observed. The
   cyclonic area was stationary over Western Europe for three consecutive
   days (4-6 November), due to the blocking situation over Eastern Europe.
   The mesoscale Regional Atmospheric Modelling System (RAMS), driven by
   the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts analyses, was
   used to simulate this event. We focused our attention on the target area
   (Tanaro and Bormida valleys). As we were interested in the hydrologic
   budget during the flood, we replaced the original soil scheme of RAMS (a
   version of Biosphere Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS), too simplified
   to allow very detailed pattern resolution) with the Land Surface Process
   Model (LSPM). This method allowed all components of the hydrologic
   budget to be inferred during the flood episode, particularly the runoff
   and soil moisture content. The results of the simulation demonstrated
   that the coupled model RAMS-LSPM was able to give a quite realistic
   representation of a mesoscale event such as the flood event in this
   study. The coupling with LSPM improved RAMS not only because the coupled
   model can represent the upper- and surface-level fields (geopotential,
   potential temperature and specific humidity), but also because it
   provides quantitative estimates of the hydrologic budget and other
   surface parameters. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of the soil moisture initialization on predicting rainfall
   in a limited-area model (LAM) was analysed. The model selected for the
   simulation was the LAM of Bologna (LAMBO). The case study selected in
   this paper was the flash flood episode that occurred during September
   1995 in the South Ticino area (Switzerland). Two different experiments
   were conducted. In the first experiment, all initial fields including
   the initial soil moisture were provided by European Centre for
   Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) analyses. In the second one, the
   initial soil moisture fields were calculated by running a
   soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer scheme (the Land Surface Process
   Model-LSPM) in stand-alone mode. The LSPM was driven by the synoptic
   observations carried out on a mesoscale area that includes Northern
   Italy. In order to overcome the well-known problem of the initial soil
   moisture content, LSPM was run for a long period (5 months) preceding
   the flood, in order to reach a stability state. The soil moisture field
   calculated by LSPM is more structured than the ECMWF one, and the
   numerical values of soil moisture are generally lower than those of
   ECMWF. The results seemed to indicate that the precipitation field
   obtained for the flood episode in the second experiment is closer to the
   observations than in the control run, even if there were still some
   underestimations. The precipitation peak modelled on South Ticino was
   closer to the observations, and this result seems to confirm the
   importance of the correct initialization of the soil moisture field even
   in cases of short-range forecasting. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons,

   method utilizes the statistical properties such as cross-, auto- and

   standard algorithm for training. The methodology has been validated
   using the data for a river basin in India. The results of the study are
   highly promising and indicate that it could significantly reduce the
   effort and computational time required in developing an ANN model.

Title = {{Geochemical weathering at the bed of Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland

Abstract = {{Waters were sampled from 17 boreholes at Haut Glacier d'Arolla during
   the 1993 and 1994 ablation seasons. Three types of concentrated
   subglacial water were identified, based on the relative proportions of
   Ca2+, HCO3- and SO42- to Si. Type A waters are the most solute rich and
   have the lowest relative proportion of Si. They are believed to form in
   hydrologically inefficient areas of a distributed drainage system. Most
   solute is obtained from coupled sulphide oxidation and carbonate
   dissolution (SO-CD). It is possible that there is a subglacial source of
   O-2, perhaps from gas levels found (up to 1200 mueq/L) are greater than
   could be bubbles released during regelation, because the high SO42-
   achieved if sulphides are oxidized by oxygen in saturated water at
   0degreesC (c, 414 mueg/L). A more likely alternative is that sulphide is
   oxidized by in anoxic environments. If this is the case, exchange
   reactions involving Fe-III and Fe-II from silicates are possible. These
   have the potential to generate relatively high concentrations of HCO3-
   with respect to SO42-. Formation of secondary weathering products, such
   as clays, may explain the low Si concentrations of Type A waters. Type B
   waters were the most frequently sampled subglacial water. They are
   believed to be representative of waters flowing in more efficient parts
   of a distributed drainage system. Residence time and reaction kinetics
   help determine the solute composition of these waters. The initial
   water-rock reactions are carbonate and silicate hydrolysis, and there is
   exchange of divalent cations from solution for monovalent cations held
   on surface exchange sites. Hydrolysis is followed by SO-CD. The SO42-
   concentrations usually are <414 mueq/L, although some range up to 580
   mueq/L, which suggests that elements of the distributed drainage system
   may become anoxic. Type C waters were the most dilute, yet they were
   very turbid. Their chemical composition is characterized by low SO42-
   :HCO3- ratios and high pH. Type C waters were usually artefacts of the
   borehole chemical weathering environment. True Type C waters are
   believed to flow through sulphide-poor basal debris, particularly in the
   channel marginal zone. The composition of bulk runoff was most similar
   to diluted Type B waters at high discharge, and was similar to a mixture
   of Type B and C waters at lower discharge, These observations suggest
   that some supraglacial meltwaters input to the bed arc stored
   temporarily in the channel marginal zone during rising discharge and are
   released during declining flow.
   Little of the subglacial chemical weathering we infer is associated with
   the sequestration of atmospheric CO2. The progression of reactions is
   from carbonate and silicate hydrolysis, through sulphide oxidation by
   first oxygen and then Fe which drives further carbonate and silicate
   weathering. A crude estimate of the ratio of carbonate to silicate
   weathering following hydrolysis is 4:1. We speculate that microbial
   oxidation of organic carbon also may occur. Both sulphide oxidation and
   microbial oxidation of organic carbon are likely to drive the bed
   towards suboxic conditions. Hence, we believe that subglacial chemical
   weathering does not sequester significant quantities of atmospheric CO2
   and that one of the key controls on the rate and magnitude of solute
   acquisition is microbial activity, which catalyses the reduction of
   Fe-III and the oxidation of FeS2. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the possibility to improve discharge
   predictions from a Jumped hydrological model through assimilation of
   remotely sensed soil moisture values. Therefore, an algorithm to
   estimate surface soil moisture values through active microwave remote
   sensing is developed, bypassing the need to collect in situ ground
   parameters. The algorithm to estimate soil moisture by use of radar data
   combines a physically based and an empirical back-scatter model. This
   method estimates effective soil roughness parameters, and good estimates
   of surface soil moisture are provided for bare soils. These remotely
   sensed soil moisture values over bare soils are then assimilated into a
   hydrological model using the statistical correction method. The results
   suggest that it is possible to determine soil moisture values over bare
   soils from remote sensing observations without the need to collect
   ground truth data, and that there is potential to improve model-based
   discharge predictions through assimilation of these remotely sensed soil
   moisture values. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the performance of two hydrological-response models is
   evaluated and compared based upon simulations for a single
   rainfall-runoff event. The two models are QPBRRM, a relatively simple
   model of Horton overland flow, and InHM, a comprehensive physics-based
   model of each of the known streamflow generation mechanisms. The
   rainfall-runoff event focused upon in this study is from the small
   rangeland catchment in Oklahoma known as R-5. When calibrated, both
   QPBRRM and InHM are shown to effectively simulate the R-5 event. The
   calibration procedures used in this study for QPBRRM and InHM were quite
   different. The calibration of QPBRRM was a curve fitting exercise,
   whereas the calibration of InHM was based upon an internally valid
   estimate of the continuous head field. In this study QPBRRM did not
   perform well outside of the calibrated range. The impact of the roads
   cutting across the R-5 catchment is simulated with InHM and discussed
   for the first time in the study reported here. The relative merits of
   QPBRRM and InHM are each discussed. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{This study evaluates two (of the many) modelling approaches to flood
   forecasting for an upland catchment (the River South Tyne at Haydon
   Bridge, England). The first modelling approach utilizes `traditional'
   hydrological models. It consists of a rainfall-runoff model (the
   probability distributed model, or PDM) for flow simulation in the upper
   catchment. Those flows are then routed to the lower catchment using two
   kinematic wave (KW) routing models. When run in forecast-mode, the PDM
   and KW models utilize model updating procedures. The second modelling
   approach uses neural network models, which use a `pattern-matching'
   process to produce model forecasts.
   Following calibration, the models are evaluated in terms of their fit to
   continuous stage data and flood event magnitudes and timings within a
   validation period. Forecast times of I h, 2 It and 4 h are selected (the
   catchment has a response time of approximately 4 h). The `traditional'
   models generally perform adequately at all three forecast times. The
   neural networks produce reasonable forecasts of small- to medium-sized
   flood events but have difficulty in forecasting the magnitude of the
   larger flood events in the validation period. Possible modifications to
   the latter approach are discussed. (C) Crown copyright 2002. Reproduced

Abstract = {{We report the results of numerical and analytical simulations to test
   the hypothesis that downward vertical flow of porewater from the crests
   of domed alpine and kettle bogs controls vertical porewater
   distributions of major solutes such as Ca and Mg. The domed Etang de la
   Gruere bog (EGr), Switzerland, characterized by a vertical downward
   gradient of 0.04 and stratified layers of peat, is chosen as a field
   site for the model calibration and evaluation. The middle 4-m section of
   the 6.5 m thick bog peat is heavily humified and has a hydraulic
   conductivity of similar to10(-56) cm s(-1). Above and below, peat is
   less humified with a hydraulic conductivity of similar to10(-3) cm
   s(-1). Heuristic finite difference simulations, using Visual MODFLOW, of
   the bog hydraulics show that the higher conductivity peat at the bog
   base is critical to create the observed deep, local flow cells that
   substantively recharge porewater.
   Model results and Peclet number calculations show that before similar
   to7000 C-14 yr BP diffusion of solutes from underlying mineral soils
   controlled the vertical distribution of porewater chemistry. From 7000
   to similar to1250 C-14 Bp the porewater chemistry was probably
   controlled by both upward diffusion and downward advection, and after
   similar to1250 C-14 yr BP porewater chemistry was probably controlled by
   downward advection. Concentrations of conservative major solutes in the
   porewaters of alpine, ombrotrophic bogs are the net effect of both
   downward vertical porewater movement and upward vertical diffusion, the
   magnitudes of which are delicately poised to the configuration of the
   bog water table over time and subsurface peat stratigraphy. Copyright

Abstract = {{Traditional flood-frequency analysis involves the assumption of
   homogeneity of the flood distribution. However, floods are often
   generated by heterogeneous distributions composed of a mixture of two or
   more populations. Differences between the populations may be the result
   of a number of factors, including seasonal variations in the
   flood-producing mechanisms, changes in weather patterns resulting from
   low-frequency climate shifts and/or El Nino/La Nina oscillations,
   changes in channel routing owing to the dominance of within-channel or
   floodplain flow, and basin variability resulting from changes in
   antecedent soil moisture. Not recognizing these physical processes in
   conventional flood-frequency analysis probably is the main reason that
   many frequency distributions do not provide an acceptable fit to flood
   data. In this paper, we use long-term hydroclimatic records from the
   Gila River basin of south-east and central Arizona in the USA to explore
   the extent and significance of mixed populations. First, we discuss the
   probable causes of heterogeneity in the frequency distribution of annual
   flood and present evidence of its occurrence. Second, we investigate the
   implications of using various popular homogeneous distributions for
   predicting peak flows for basins that exhibit mixed population
   characteristics. Third, we demonstrate how alternative frequency models
   that explicitly account for floods generated by a mixture of two or more
   populations are both hydrologically and statistically more appropriate.
   We illustrate how the selection of the most plausible distribution for
   flood-frequency analysis also should be based on hydrological reasoning
   as opposed to the sole application of the traditional statistical
   goodness-of-fit tests. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative analysis or a variety of relationships for prediction of
   basin lag is performed by applying them to 23 basins located in the same
   geographical area and characterized by a rather similar vegetative
   cover. The results of computations indicate that a lag-area relationship
   with two constant parameters is the best predictor for most basins;
   under different vegetative covers in the same basin only one parameter
   should be variable. For a few other basins characterized by an anomalous
   drainage channel network of low density, such a relationship can lead to
   unacceptable errors. Thus, there is a need for an additional
   relationship to overcome this difficulty, but a larger number of
   anomalous basins would be required for its determination. An alternative
   procedure, based on the use of the non-linear kinematic wave, which at
   least allows singling out the cases where a specific lag-area
   relationship is not reliable, is proposed. This procedure, therefore,
   represents a partial but very useful solution to avoid considerable
   errors in hydrological practice. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{An automated tunnel evaporation-rate measurement system (TEMS) has been
   designed to measure automatically the evaporation from a cylinder 0.30 m
   in diameter and similar to0.10 m tall. This cylinder continuously
   maintains a constant height of water, with losses to evaporation
   replenished from a stilling cylinder connected to a water reservoir. The
   evaporation rate is measured by a transducer located at the bottom of
   the stilling well. The TEMS was tested over a period of 3 months in an
   underground research facility with relatively strong wind effects,
   changing temperature, and changing humidity. During this period, the
   TEMS continued to function uninterrupted, automatically measuring the
   evaporation amounts along a tunnel and an enclosed niche. These
   observations suggest that this tool can be useful for investigations of
   evaporation processes both in enclosed and ventilated environments.

Abstract = {{Knowledge of winter streamflow regimes is required in northern
   catchments to evaluate water supply and to assess the vulnerability of
   aquatic habitat. The objective of this study was to explore the nature
   and causes of winter streamflow variability in northern rivers through
   examination of a limited number of case studies involving intensive
   field measurements, as well as a synoptic analysis of winter streamflow
   measurements archived by Water Survey of Canada for rivers in Yukon
   Territory, Canada. Evidence was found for an abrupt decrease in
   discharge at freeze-up in one of the case studies and for 10 of the 25
   stations in the synoptic analysis that had measurements within 30 days
   of freeze-up (an additional 12 stations had no measurements within 30
   days of freeze-up). However, given the paucity of measurements in the
   early winter, the magnitude, duration and frequency of these events
   cannot be specified. The case studies indicate that, even where a
   coherent depression does not occur, discharge can fluctuate around a
   smooth recession trend for about the first 30 days after the onset of
   ice effects, probably as a result of transient storage and release of
   water behind ice jams. A storage-depletion model that represents
   streamflow as outflow from two parallel linear reservoirs provided a
   reasonable fit to most of the observed measurements (excluding those in
   the first 30 days following freeze-up), with model fit deteriorating
   with increasing latitude and decreasing catchment size. The effect of
   latitude could relate to abstraction of flow by ice production, which
   would cause deviations from a storage-depletion trend. Northern
   catchments also tended to have steeper late-winter recessions, which
   could reflect a lack of extensive, deep aquifers to maintain late-winter
   discharge. The tendency to poorer model fit in smaller catchments could
   reflect a problem with data reliability, since it is more difficult to
   find good winter gauging sections in smaller streams. Some evidence for
   temperature-related discharge fluctuations was found in both the case
   studies and synoptic analyses. However, the magnitude of these effects
   appears to be about 10 to 15\%, at most, and not to be consistent
   between winters. Further advances in understanding winter streamflow
   variability will require frequent measurements on a range of streams
   over a number of winters. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{For most ice-covered rivers at northern latitudes, the spring freshet is
   often the largest hydrologic event of the year. Based on a case study of
   the Mackenzie River, water released from hydraulic storage due to flow
   abstraction during the early winter is shown to be a major component of
   the flow volume that comprises the following spring freshet. The amount
   of water placed into hydraulic and ice-growth storage over a 60-day
   period was calculated to be equal to 27\% of the flow that would
   normally have occurred during this period if an ice cover had not
   formed. The amount of water released from this ice-induced hydraulic
   storage at the time of break-up and the concomitant spring snowmelt peak
   accounted for 15 to 19\% of the spring freshet volume, depending on the
   temporal definition of the `release' period. The ice-related
   contribution increases to as much as 25\% of freshet volume if the ice
   growth during the fall depression is also included. Importantly, even
   this percentage is considered an underestimate since it does not take
   into account the flow contribution from the melt of the complete winter
   ice cover. If the ice-induced storage volume is not accounted for in the
   spring hydrograph, then the volumes of water from spring snowmelt and/or
   rainfall would be significantly overestimated. Copyright (C) 2002 John

Abstract = {{The breakup of ice in Canadian rivers and the ensuing ice jams have a
   multitude of socio-economic impacts. Equally important, but not as well
   understood, is the strong relationship between the breakup event and the
   aquatic ecosystem in terms of both habitat and life cycle. Because
   breakup processes are highly sensitive to weather conditions, there is
   concern over the potential effects of changing climatic patterns on the
   ice-jam regime and thus on the stream ecology and local economy. Though
   breakup commonly occurs in the: spring, it is occasionally triggered by
   mid-winter `thaws', which are typical of the more temperate regions of
   Canada. Mid-winter jams can be more destructive than spring ones and may
   also have repercussions on the spring event. Current knowledge suggests
   that small perturbations in winter temperature can produce major changes
   in the incidence of breakup and ice jams, by altering snowstorms into
   rainfall events. This expectation is confirmed by a hydroclimatic
   analysis of field observations and historical data on the upper reach of
   the Saint John River, which forms the boundary between New Brunswick,
   Canada and Maine, USA. A slight warming in the past 80 years has been
   accompanied by a considerable increase in the occurrence of mild winter
   days, thus contributing to increasing rainfall amounts. This results in
   augmented flows during the winter, which are lately becoming capable of
   effecting breakup of the river-ice cover. Implications for future trends
   in the ice regime of the Saint John River and of other Canadian rivers
   are discussed. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Ice is present during a part of the year on many rivers of cold, and
   even temperate, regions of the globe. Though largely ignored in
   hydrological literature, river ice has serious hydrologic impacts,
   including extreme flood events caused by ice jams, interference with
   transportation and energy production, low winter flows and associated
   ecological and water quality consequences. It is also a major factor in
   the life cycle of many aquatic and other species, being both beneficial
   and destructive, depending on location and time of year. A brief review
   of the hydrologic aspects of river ice shows strong climatic links and
   illustrates the sensitivity of the entire ice regime to changes in
   climatic conditions. To date, this sensitivity has oily partly been
   documented: the vast majority of related studies have focused on the
   timing of freeze-up and break-up over the past century, and indicate
   trends that are consistent with concomitant changes in air temperature.
   It is only in the past few years that attention has been paid to the
   more complex, and practically more important, question of what climatic
   change may do to the frequency and severity of extreme ice jams, floods
   and low flows. The probable changes to the ice regime of rivers, and
   associated hydrological processes and impacts, are discussed in the
   light of current understanding. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A significant body of research exists on river hydraulics and sediment
   transport during open-water conditions, and to a lesser extent during
   the period of ice-cover. Most of the ice-related studies, however, are
   based on controlled laboratory experiments or field studies conducted
   under stable ice-cover conditions. They have largely ignored the most
   dynamic periods, such as breakup, when hydraulic conditions are most
   rapidly changing and energy levels are maximized. Moreover, the entire
   pre-breakup to ice-clearance period is virtually devoid of even standard
   hydrometric measurements of suspended sediment, largely because of
   safety and logistic problems. Some recent work has pointed to the
   formation of a sediment plume comprising fine-grained sediments that
   develops before the main breakup fracturing of the ice cover. This plume
   has been noted as being particularly ecologically significant because it
   can contain the winter-long deposition of contaminants that
   preferentially attach to fine-grained material. Unfortunately, however,
   because measurements of the critical parameters affecting sediment
   transport during these periods are rarely taken, much uncertainty
   remains about the hydraulic forces that resuspend and transport
   sediments under an ice cover, and particularly for cohesive fine-grained
   sediments. This paper describes a field experiment designed to broaden
   our understanding of sediment transport during this critical pre-breakup
   period. Detailed measurements of river stage, ice elevations, flow
   velocity profiles and suspended sediment were taken over a 17-day period
   just before the 1998 river-ice breakup at flay River, Northwest
   Territories, Canada. Results indicated that just before breakup, the
   shear stress, which governs the beginning of sediment motion, increases
   dramatically and drives the development of the under-ice sediment plume
   of very fine-grained, cohesive sediments. The shear stress in this case
   became critical at a mean under-ice velocity of 0.4 m/s. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{An analytical study of major cations and anions of the proglacial
   streams of Garhwal Himalaya has been carried out to assess the
   weathering and geochemical processes in high altitude river basins.
   Calcium and magnesium are the major cations, and bicarbonate and
   sulphate are the most dominant anions in these waters. A high
   correlation among HCO3, Ca and Mg, a relatively high contribution of (Ca
   + Mg) to the total cations (TZ(+)) and high (Ca + Mg/Na + K) ratio
   indicate carbonate weathering could be the primary source of the
   dissolved ions. Carbonic acid weathering is the major proton-producing
   reaction in the Alaknanda River, while in the Bhagirathi River it is the
   coupled reaction which controls the solute acquisition processes. To
   know the geochemical factors controlling the chemical nature of water,
   R-mode factor analysis on major ion data from Ganga headwater streams
   has been performed. Factor 1 in the Alaknanda River is explicitly a
   bicarbonate factor showing strong loading of EC, Ca, Mg, HCO3 and TDS.
   In the Bhagirathi River Factor I explains the sulphide dissolution and
   silicate weathering and Factor 2 explains carbonate weathering. Wide
   downstream variations are observed in the total dissolved solids (TDS)
   and total suspended matter (TSM) in the headwater streams of the Ganga.
   Quartz and feldspar are the common detrital minerals, and kaolinite and
   illite the common clay minerals in the suspended sediment. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The stable isotope stratigraphy of river- and lake-ice archives winter
   hydroclimatic conditions, and can potentially be used to identify
   changing water sources or to provide important insights into ice
   formation processes and growth rates. However, accurate interpretations
   rely on known isotopic fractionation during ice growth. A
   one-dimensional diffusion model of the liquid boundary layer adjacent to
   an advancing solid interface, originally developed to simulate solute
   rejection by growing crystals, has been used without verification to
   describe non-equilibrium fractionation during congelation ice growth.
   Results are not in agreement, suggesting the presence of important
   uncertainties. In this paper we seek validation of the diffusion model
   for this application using large-scale laboratory experiments with
   controlled freezing rates and frequent sampling. We obtained consistent,
   almost constant, isotopic boundary layer thicknesses over a
   representative range of ice growth rates on both quiescent and
   well-mixed water. With the O-18 boundary layer thickness from the
   laboratory, the model successfully quantified reduced river-ice growth
   rates relative to those of a nearby fake. These results were more
   representative and easier to obtain than those of a conventional thermal
   ice-growth model. This diffusion model validation and boundary layer
   thickness determination provide a powerful tool for interpreting the
   stable isotope stratigraphy of floating ice. The laboratory experiment
   also replicated successive fractionation events in response to a
   freeze-thaw-refreeze cycle, providing a mechanism for apparent ice
   fractionation that exceeds equilibrium. Analysis of the composition of
   snow ice and frazil ice in river and lake cores indicated surprising
   similarities between these ice forms. Published in 2002 by John Wiley

Abstract = {{The process of isotopic fractionation during freezing in the riverine
   environment is discussed with reference to a multi-year isotope sampling
   survey conducted in the Liard-Mackenzie River Basins, northwestern
   Canada. Systematic isotopic patterns are evident in cores of congelation
   ice (black ice) obtained from rivers and from numerous tributaries that
   are recognized as primary streamflow signals but with isotope offsets
   close to the equilibrium ice-water fractionation. The results, including
   comparisons with the isotopic composition of fall and spring streamflow
   measured directly in water samples, suggest that isotopic shifts during
   ice-on occur due to gradual changes in the fraction of flow derived from
   groundwater, surface water and precipitation sources during the fall to
   winter recession. Low flow isotopic signatures during ice-on suggest a
   predominantly groundwater-fed regime during late winter, whereas low
   flow isotopic signatures during ice-off reflect a mixed groundwater-,
   surface water- and precipitation-fed regime during late fall. Copyright

Abstract = {{Rivers in northern Japan are subjected to ice formation each winter.
   They are typically very steep with rapid changes in channel slope. As a
   result, ice covers are usually discontinuous with open water sections.
   Winter discharges in Japanese rivers are usually very small. Water
   temperature and ice production in these streams are very sensitive to
   the change in air temperature. The open water sections enable the
   formation of frazil and anchor ice during the winter. Owing to the
   relatively stable winter weather and heavy snow cover, premature
   break-up and ice jams rarely occur, even though the channel geometry of
   these rivers is favourable for their occurrence. In this paper,
   hydrometeorological factors related to ice-cover formation, frazil and
   anchor-ice development, and ice-jam formation, as well as measurements
   of the undercover discharge in rivers in northern Japan are discussed.

Abstract = {{The state-of-the-art of the hydrological network for the study of
   river-ice regimes in the Russian Arctic is reviewed as well as the
   regularly published documents that characterize specific features of ice
   events. The dates of the beginning of different ice events (e.g. ice
   drift, ice-cover formation, frazil ice drift, etc.) are analysed as well
   as the duration of such events for 16 rivers typical of the Russian
   Arctic. It is demonstrated that ice on Arctic rivers of Asian Russia
   forms earlier and breaks up later compared to those of European Russia;
   this is explained by the more severe climate conditions that affect the
   northern areas of Siberia. Ice-cover duration on the study rivers varies
   from 140 to 250 days with the maximum duration being observed in the;
   lower reaches of large rivers in East Siberia and the Far East.
   Ice-cover duration and the latitude of the observation stations are
   strongly correlated. The dynamics of ice-cover growth and melting on
   rivers, ice thickness and snow-pack depth on the ice are considered in
   different parts of the Russian Arctic. It is demonstrated that the
   nature of ice growth during the autumn-winter period and its decrease in
   spring mainly depend on the thermal conditions during a particular year.
   In years with low air temperatures, ice-cover thickness in the rivers of
   the Far East can attain 200 cm and greater, meanwhile it tray be 50 or
   60 em only in the rivers of European Russia if the winter is warm.
   Particular case studies are given to illustrate these features.

Abstract = {{Fisheries managers have often suggested that survival of trout during
   the winter is a major factor affecting population densities in many
   stream ecosystems in the Rocky Mountains. In Wyoming, trout population
   reductions from fall to spring in excess of 90\% have been documented in
   some reservoir tailwaters. Though biologists have surmised that these
   reductions were the result of either mortality or emigration from some
   river sections, the specific mechanisms have not been defined and the
   factors leading to the trout loss are unknown. This is a review of four
   studies that were conducted or funded between 1991 and 1998 by the
   Wyoming Game and Fish Department to understand the extent of overwinter
   losses, identify some of the mechanisms leading to those conditions and
   develop management strategies to help avoid those impacts. Winter
   studies were conducted on tailwater fisheries in the Green, North
   Platte, Bighorn and Shoshone rivers to document trout population
   dynamics, assess physical habitat availability, evaluate trout movement
   and habitat selection, and understand the relationships between food
   availability and bioenergetic relationships. Results indicate that
   winter trout losses are extreme in some years, that trout movement and
   habitat selection are affected by supercooled flows, and that mortality
   is probably not directly due to starvation. The combination of
   physiological impairment with frequently altered habitat availability
   probably leads to indirect mortality from predators and other factors.

Abstract = {{Applications of computer programs in the assessment of how a change in
   discharge, temperature and other physical conditions affects the
   available fish habitat are increasing around the world. The programs are
   typically used as tools for setting minimum flow regimes in regulated
   rivers and in habitat remedial actions. So far most of these
   applications have been concerned with warm water and summer conditions,
   and few applications incorporate winter temperatures and ice conditions.
   This is a flaw in the current procedure since winter may be the limiting
   period for fish production in a river and the introduction of ice may
   completely alter the available fish habitat compared to summer
   conditions. It is particularly important to be aware of this when
   carrying out habitat remedial actions, since short periods with adverse
   winter conditions may be the limiting factor for the fish population. A
   winter habitat assessment procedure will include a study of fish
   behaviour in winter conditions, the effects of various ice types on
   habitat selection and the dynamics of ice breakup on the microscale.
   This paper outlines how fish respond to winter conditions and how
   hydraulic, hydrologic and biological modelling can be applied to
   describe winter conditions and their impact on physical fish habitat,
   Some of these processes are currently being incorporated into the
   Norwegian habitat modelling system. This paper also points out several
   areas where more research is needed to describe the physical processes
   and the biological responses to a changing environment. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Factors controlling the partitioning of old and new water contributions
   to stream flow were investigated for three events in four catchments
   (three of which were nested) at Sleepers River Research Watershed in
   Danville, Vermont. In the 1993 snowmelt period, two-component isotopic
   hydrograph separations showed that new water (meltwater) inputs to the
   stream ranged widely from 41 to 74\%. and increased with catchment size
   (41 to 11 125 ha) (with one exception) and with open land cover
   (0-73\%). Peak dissolved organic carbon concentrations and relative
   alkalinity dilution in stream water ranked in the same order among
   catchments as the new water fractions, suggesting that new water
   followed shallow flow paths. During the 1994 snowmelt, despite similar
   timing and magnitude of melt inputs, the new-water contribution to
   stream flow ranged only from 30 to 36\% in the four catchments. We
   conclude that the uncommonly high and variable new water fractions in
   streamwater during the 1993 melt were caused by direct runoff of
   meltwater over frozen ground, which was prevalent in open land areas
   during the 1993 winter. In a high-intensity summer rainstorm in 1993.
   new water fractions were smaller relative to the 1993 snowmelt, ranging
   from 28 to 46\%, but they ranked in the identical catchment order.
   Reconciliation of the contrasting patterns of new-old water partitioning
   in the three events appears to require an explanation that invokes
   multiple processes and effects, including:
   1. topographically controlled increase in surface-saturated area with
   increasing catchment size; 2. direct runoff over frozen ground; 3. low
   infiltration in agriculturally compacted soils; 4. differences in soil
   transmissivity, which may be more relevant under dry antecedent
   conditions.
   These data highlight some of the difficulties faced by catchment
   hydrologists in formulating a theory of runoff generation at varying
   basin scales. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of scaling statistical properties in temporal rainfall has
   been well established in many empirical investigations during the latest
   decade. These properties have more and more come to be regarded as a
   fundamental feature of the rainfall process. How to best use the scaling
   properties for applied modelling remains to be assessed, however,
   particularly in the case of continuous rainfall time-series. One
   therefore is forced to use conventional time-series modelling, e.g.
   based on point process theory, which does not explicitly take scaling
   into account. In light of this, there is a need to investigate the
   degree to which point-process models are able to unintentionally
   reproduce the empirical scaling properties. In the present study, four
   25-year series of 20-min rainfall intensities observed in Arno River
   basin, Italy, were investigated. A Neyman-Scott rectangular pulses
   (NSRP) model was fitted to these series, so enabling the generation of
   synthetic time-series suitable for investigation. A multifractal scaling
   behaviour was found to characterize the raw data within a range of
   time-scales between approximately 20 min and 1 week. The main features
   of this behaviour were surprisingly well reproduced in the simulated
   data, although some differences were observed, particularly at small
   scales below the typical duration of a rain cell. This suggests the
   possibility of a combined use of the NSRP model and a scaling approach,
   in order to extend the NSRP range of applicability for simulation
   purposes, Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to identify the mechanisms of runoff
   generation and routing and their controlling factors at the hillslope
   scale, on artificial slopes derived from surface coal mining reclamation
   in a Mediterranean-continental area. Rainfall and runoff at interrill
   and microcatchment scales were recorded for a year on two slopes with
   different substrata: topsoil cover and overburden cover. Runoff
   coefficient and runoff routing from interrill areas to microcatchment
   outlets were higher in the overburden substratum than in topsoil, and
   greater in the most developed rill network. Rainfall volume is the major
   parameter responsible for runoff response on overburden, suggesting that
   this substratum is very impermeable - at least during the main rainfall
   periods of the year (late spring and autumn) when the soil surface is
   sealed. In such conditions, most rainfall input is converted into
   runoff, regardless of its intensity. Results from artificial rainfall
   experiments, conducted 3 and 7 years after seeding, confirm the low
   infiltration capacity of overburden when sealed. The hydrological
   response shows great seasonal variability on the overburden slope in
   accordance with soil surface changes over the year. Rainfall volume and
   intensities (I-30, I-60) explain runoff at the inter-rill scale on the
   topsoil slope, where rainfall experiments demonstrated a typical
   Hortonian infiltration curve, However, no correlation was found at the
   microcatchment level, probably because of the loss of functionality of
   the only rill as ecological succession proceeded, The runoff generation
   mechanism on the topsoil slope is more homogeneous throughout the year.
   Runoff connectivity, defined as the ratio between runoff rates recorded
   at the rill network scale and those recorded at the interrill area scale
   in every rainfall event, was also greater on the rilled overburden
   slope, and in the most developed rill network. The dense rill networks
   of the overburden slope guarantee very effective runoff drainage,
   regardless of rainfall magnitude. Rills drain overland flow from
   interrill-sealed areas, reducing the opportunity of reinfiltration in
   areas not affected by siltation. Runoff generation and routing on
   topsoil slopes are controlled by grass cover and soil moisture content,
   whereas on overburden slopes rill network density and soil moisture
   content are the main controlling factors. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley

Abstract = {{A 40 m x 20 m mowed, grass hillslope adjacent to a headwater stream
   within a 26-ha watershed in east-central Pennsylvania, USA, was
   instrumented to identify and map the extent and dynamics of surface
   saturation (areas with the water table at the surface) and surface
   runoff source areas, Rainfall, stream flow and surface runoff from the
   hillslope were recorded at 5-min intervals from 11 August to 22 November
   1998, and 13 April to 12 November 1999. The dynamics of the water table
   (0 to 45 cm depth from the soil surface) and the occurrence of surface
   runoff source areas across the hillslope were recorded using specially
   designed subsurface saturation and surface runoff sensors, respectively.
   Detailed data analyses for two rainfall events that occurred in August
   (57.7 mm in 150 min) and September (83.6 mm in 1265 min) 1999,
   illustrated the spatial and temporal dynamics of surface saturation and
   surface runoff source areas. Temporal data analyses showed the necessity
   to measure the hillslope dynamics at time intervals comparable to that
   of rainfall measurements, Both infiltration excess surface runoff
   (runoff caused when rainfall intensity exceeds soil infiltration
   capacity) and saturation excess surface runoff (runoff caused when soil
   moisture storage capacity is exceeded) source areas were recorded during
   these rainfall events. The August rainfall event was primarily an
   infiltration excess surface runoff event, whereas the September rainfall
   event produced both infiltration excess and saturation excess surface
   runoff. Occurrence and disappearance of infiltration excess surface
   runoff source areas during the rainfall events appeared scattered across
   the hillslope. Analysis of surface saturation and surface runoff data
   showed that not all surface saturation areas produced surface runoff
   that reached the stream. Emergence of subsurface flow to the surface
   during the post-rainfall periods appeared to be a major flow process
   dominating the hillslope after the August rainfall event. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The relevance of bypass flow on water flow, solute or pesticide
   transport is becoming increasingly recognized. Recent investigations
   proved that soil salinization may be influenced by bypass flow, i.e. the
   rapid transport of water and solutes via macropores and/or shrinkage
   cracks to subsoil and groundwater. This paper explores the role of
   bypass flow in the process of accumulation and leaching of solutes, as
   well as of sodium, in a Mediterranean cracking soil irrigated with
   saline/sodic waters. The results of bypass flow experiments per-formed
   on undisturbed soil cores showed that leaching of solutes occurred in
   concomitance with bypass fluxes when a low salinity solution was
   alternated with a high salinity solution. Exchange of solutes between
   the incoming solution and the soil matrix occurred during the bypass
   flow events at the contact surfaces (cracks walls) between the solution
   and the soil matrix and where cracks terminated in the soil samples.
   Concomitant exchanges of sodium were indicated by measurements performed
   in the effluent solution during the bypass flow measurements. The amount
   of Sodium released from the soil during the bypass flow events, as well
   as that of the soluble salts leached from the soil, were found to depend
   on the degree of soil cracking. These results indicated that:
   1. in management of irrigation in cracking soils, under the occurrence
   of bypass fluxes, alternating a low salinity/sodicity water with a high
   salinity/sodicity solution can be effective for preventing salinization
   and sodification: 2. greater efficiency of removal of sodium/soluble
   salts can be obtained if application of the leaching solution is
   performed when the soil is at a considerable degree of cracking.

Abstract = {{Hydrological modelling often implies the use of rainfall data. Its
   quality and resolution directly affect the accuracy of the simulation
   results. This study illustrates that a simple approach of incorporating
   rainfall intensity information in daily rainfall records significantly
   improves the simulation of surface runoff and rainfall infiltration into
   soil profiles. The procedure is developed using a frequency analysis on
   rainfall data of the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium,
   collected with a resolution of 10 min and for a consecutive period of 61
   years. The frequency analysis of the data allowed the incorporation of
   rainfall intensity information into daily rainfall records. To test the
   effect of this approach the surface runoff and water flow into three
   different soil types was simulated using the HYDRUS-1D model for a
   typical dry, normal and wet year. The simulation results whereby the
   observed 10-min rainfall data was used as input were considered as the
   reference. Comparative analysis revealed that the simulations using the
   10 min rainfall data deducted from the incorporation of rainfall
   intensity into daily rainfall records, deviate a maximum 1.2\% from the
   reference and produce much better results than the Soil Conservation
   Service (SCS) runoff curve-number method because rainfall intensity is
   considered in the procedure presented. The SCS curve-number method
   typical overestimates surface runoff during periods of low rainfall
   intensity (winter) and underestimate runoff during periods of high
   rainfall intensities (summer). Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A modular approach to model design and construction provides a flexible
   framework in which to focus the multidisciplinary research and
   operational efforts needed to facilitate the development, selection, and
   application of the most robust distributed modelling methods. A variety
   of modular approaches have been developed, but with little consideration
   for compatibility among systems and concepts. Several systems are
   proprietary, limiting any user interaction. The US Geological Survey
   modular modelling system (MMS) is a modular modelling framework that
   uses an open source software approach to enable all members of the
   scientific community to address collaboratively the many complex issues
   associated with the design, development, and application of distributed
   hydrological and environmental models. Implementation of a common
   modular concept is not a trivial task. However, it brings the resources
   of a larger community to bear on the problems of distributed modelling,
   provides a framework in which to compare alternative modelling
   approaches objectively, and provides a means of sharing the latest
   modelling advances. The concepts and components of the MMS are described
   and an example application of the MMS, in a decision-support system
   context, is presented to demonstrate current system capabilities.

Abstract = {{The paper introduces a new distributed rainfall-runoff model derived
   upon the assumption that the horizontal flow at a point in the soil and
   over the surface can be approximated by means of a kinematic wave model.
   The point assumption is then integrated up to a finite pixel dimension,
   thus converting the original differential equation into a non-linear
   reservoir equation based upon physically meaningful parameters, the
   solution of which can be found numerically. The catchment behaviour is
   finally obtained by aggregating the non-linear reservoirs into three
   cascades, representing the soil, the surface and the drainage network,
   following the topographic and geomorphologic elements of the catchment.
   The main advantage of this approach lies in its capability of being
   applied at increasing spatial scales without losing the physical
   interpretation of the model and parameters. Other advantages of the
   TOPKAPI approach can be found in the full use of the digital elevation
   model, soil maps, land-use maps, etc., for the derivation of the
   non-linear reservoir cascade and for the estimate of the model
   parameters. This allows for the extension of the model to ungauged
   catchments and as a promising tool for the impact assessment of climatic
   as well as land-use changes.
   Three case-studies are presented, showing the model application to
   catchments that are different in nature and size (from a few to over a
   thousand square kilometres) and described by means of widely different
   elementary grid cells (pixels). The results of these applications are
   interesting, and they essentially fulfil the general purpose. Although
   the work to be done is still great, the model appears to be a promising
   tool worthy of further investigation. (C) Copyright 2002 John Wiley

Abstract = {{TOPMODEL, a semi-distributed, topographically based hydrological model,
   was applied to simulate continuously the runoff hydrograph of a
   medium-sized (379 km(2)), humid tropical catchment. The objectives were
   to relate hydrological responses to runoff generation mechanisms
   operating in the catchment and to estimate the uncertainty associated
   with runoff prediction. Field observations indicated that water tables
   were not parallel to the surface topography, particularly at the start
   of the wet season. A reference topographic index lambda(REF) was
   therefore introduced into the TOPMODEL structure to increase the
   weighting of local storage deficits in upland areas. The model
   adaptation had the effect of deepening water tables with distance from
   the river channel. The generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation
   (GLUE) framework was used to assess the performance of the model with
   randomly selected parameter sets, and to set simulation confidence
   limits. The model simulated well the fast subsurface and overland flow
   events superimposed on the seasonal rise and fall of the baseflow. The
   top ranked parameter sets achieved modelling efficiencies of 0.943 and
   0.849 in 1994 and 1995 respectively. The GLUE analysis showed that the
   exponential decay parameter in, controlling the baseflow and the local
   storage deficit, was the most sensitive parameter. There was increased
   uncertainty in the simulations of storm events during the early and late
   phases of the season, which was due to a combination of. errors in
   detecting the rainfall depths for convectional rainfall events; the
   treatment of rainfall as a catchment areal value; and, the strong
   seasonality in runoff response in the humid tropics. Copyright @ 2002

Abstract = {{Numerical tests indicate that Hortonian runoff mechanisms benefit from
   scaling effects that non-Hortonian runoff mechanisms do not share. This
   potentially makes Hortonian watersheds more amenable to physically based
   modelling provided that the physically based model employed properly
   accounts for rainfall distribution and initial soil moisture conditions,
   to which these types of model are highly sensitive. The distributed
   Hortonian runoff model CASC2D has been developed and tested for the US
   Army over the past decade. The purpose of the model is to provide the
   Army with superior predictions of runoff and stream-flow compared with
   the standard lumped parameter model HEC-1. The model is also to be used
   to help minimize negative effects on the landscape caused by US armed
   forces training activities. Development of the CASC2D model is complete
   and the model has been tested and applied at several locations. These
   applications indicate that the model can realistically reproduce
   hydrographs when properly applied. These applications also indicate that
   there may be many situations where the model is inadequate. Because of
   this, the Army is pursuing development of a new model, GSSHA, that will
   provide improved numerical stability and incorporate additional
   stream-flow-producing mechanisms and improved hydraulics. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The extraction of the river network from a digital elevation model (DEM)
   plays a fundamental role in modelling spatially distributed hydrological
   processes. The present paper deals with a new two-step procedure based
   on the preliminary identification of an ideal drainage network (IDN)
   from contour lines through a variable mesh size, and the further
   extraction of the actual drainage network (AND) from the IDN using land
   morphology. The steepest downslope direction search is used to identify
   individual channels, which are further merged into a network path
   draining to a given node of the IDN. The contributing area, peaks and
   saddles are determined by means of a steepest upslope direction search.
   The basin area is thus partitioned into physically based finite elements
   enclosed by irregular polygons. Different methods, i.e. the constant and
   variable threshold area methods, the contour line curvature method, and
   a topologic method descending from the Hortonian ordering scheme, are
   used to extract the ADN from the IDN. The contour line curvature method
   is shown to provide the most appropriate method from a comparison with
   field surveys. Using the ADN one can model the hydrological response of
   any sub-basin using a semi-distributed approach. The model presented
   here combines storm abstraction by the SCS-CN method with surface runoff
   routing as a geomorphological dispersion process. This is modelled using
   the gamma instantaneous unit hydrograph as parameterized by river
   geomorphology. The results are implemented using a project-oriented
   software facility for the Analysis of LAnd Digital HYdrological Networks
   (ALADHYN). Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The use of small-scale process descriptions at larger scales has been
   identified as a major problem in hydrological modelling. An alternative
   is to use measurements taken at a larger scale, such as remote sensing
   data, and to develop process descriptions at that scale.
   A hypothetical catchment area, or `virtual hydrological reality' dataset
   has been generated to explore the value of different types of data in
   model structure and parameter identification. Though only an
   approximation to the natural responses of the catchment, this virtual
   reality can be used to explore the use of observational series that
   would not normally be available.
   A data-based mechanistic approach was used to model evapotranspiration
   from 1 km data, as though they were available from remote sensing. The
   resulting parameterization is of a similar form to an evaporative
   fraction model. It is an example of the type of parameterization that
   could be used to describe the land surface, without estimation of
   effective parameters from small-scale measurements, and avoiding
   overparameterization. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Topography controls surface flows, and thereby exerts a significant
   action on soil formation. At the hillslope scale, infiltrability of the
   surface horizon varies gradually along the slope. In semi-arid zones,
   and especially in the Sahel, runoff is Hortonian and depends mainly on
   the hydraulic properties of the soil surface horizon (saturated
   hydraulic conductivity K(s) and hydraulic roughness of the soil surface
   n). Using the fully distributed hydrologic model r.water.fea as an
   experimentation tool, this paper investigates the effects of various
   spatial distributions of K(s) (deterministic, stochastic or a
   combination of both, all with an invariant global mean) and related n
   (taken as fully correlated to K(s)) on the outflow of a small catchment
   representative of Sahelian conditions. In addition to a uniform
   distribution used as reference, deterministic distributions here consist
   of linear variations of K(s) with elevation. A stochastic component is
   then added by drawing from a log-normal distribution with different
   variation coefficients C(v). Both hypothetical and real rainstorm events
   are tested.
   All K(s) distributions studied produce hydrographs that are very close
   to the uniform K(s) case when rainfall is long and intense. For most
   other rain events, runoff increases with K(s) variability. Whatever the
   rainfall event and C(v), outflow is greater when the less infiltrative
   surfaces are located downhill. The ratio of deterministic to purely
   stochastic variation is a good indication of the relative importance of
   the two K(s) variation sources for catchment runoff. Given the high
   local-scale (stochastic) soil variability typically encountered, only
   strong catchment-scale contrasts really deserve to be included in the
   K(s) distribution for runoff modelling of all but insignificant events.
   Spatial K(s) representation can be further simplified down to a uniform
   distribution, when only a seasonal water yield is the required result.

Abstract = {{A sensitivity study of the subsurface flow component of the physically
   based distributed modelling system SHETRAN using data from a small
   Mediterranean mountain catchment is presented. The parameter space
   sampled was based on ranges of parameter values measured in field
   experiments. Model results were validated by comparison against outlet
   discharge, soil moisture reserve and phreatic surface level, using a
   number of criteria. The objectives of this exercise were: to explore
   variability in simulation response produced by uncertainty in parameter
   values to use internal data to examine process representation within the
   models and to attempt to reduce uncertainty in parameter estimates
   through use of a number of response variables and a number of criteria
   in model evaluation.
   A wide range of responses Were produced from across the parameter space
   sampled. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that
   interactions between parameters are complex, and that the sensitivity of
   individual parameters changed according to the values taken by other
   parameters and to the state of the system.
   The multi-response, multi-criteria evaluation presented herein exposed
   the presence of compensating errors within the model, which conventional
   procedures, which only consider outlet discharge, might fail to detect.
   This showed that parameter optima occurred in different parts of the
   parameter space for each of the response variables considered, although
   it did show that there was a region of the parameter space in which
   acceptable results were found for all responses.
   It is suggested that the fact that parameter optima were found in
   different parts of the parameter space for different responses indicates
   incorrect estimation of those model parameters not considered as part of
   the sensitivity study or omissions in the process representation
   embodied within the current SHETRAN subsurface flow model. (C) Copyright

Abstract = {{The present study discusses the application of the physically based
   distributed MIKE-SHE code to a medium size catchment using different
   grid sizes to investigate scale effects on the model results. First a
   600 m grid-square model was calibrated. This was then subjected to a
   multi-resolution (MR) validation test by using the effective parameters
   of the calibrated model in a 300 m and a 1200 m grid-square model. The
   MR test indicated that the models for the resolutions analysed only
   differ marginally. Secondly, the effect of grid size on both the
   calibrated effective model parameters and the model performance was
   analysed in the scope of a multi-calibration test in which the
   calibration and validation processes were kept as unique and standard as
   possible for every grid size. The model was calibrated and validated for
   every grid size against both daily catchment discharge measurements and
   observed water levels using both a split sample procedure and a
   multi-site validation test. The investigation indicated that the best
   validation results, in terms of river discharge, were obtained with a
   600 m grid-resolution, independent of the stream-flow station. This,
   together with the exponential increase in computation time when reducing
   the grid size, indicates that, for the given level of data input and
   quality, the model type and structure, and the time step, a 600 m
   grid-resolution is most appropriate for the catchment under study.

Abstract = {{Both calibration and uncertainty assessment are mandatory steps in
   today's modelling process. The former considers both the inputs (input
   variables and parameters) as well as model results. An exploratory
   investigation of the applicable parameter space results in a wide
   spectrum of values for a specific model output. By retaining only those
   model realizations that mimic reality in a sufficient way, inputs and
   associated response can be constrained, thereby quantifying the
   uncertainty involved. The generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation
   (GLUE) framework provides a structured methodology for this purpose.
   The study presented focuses on the applicability of the GLUE framework
   within the context of the distributed hydrological model MIKE SHE. Even
   though all significant processes involved are incorporated within the
   model, the problems of calibration and uncertainty assessment cannot be
   avoided. This has resulted in a quest for well-delineated effective
   parameters crucial for sound mechanistic model application. Being a
   complex model, the number of possible realizations using MIKE SHE is
   fairly small due to computing time, and an in-depth exploratory approach
   is impossible. On the other hand, several output variables are available
   aside from the hydrological river response, like water content in the
   soil profile or ground water level, which can be used for retaining
   realistic parameter sets.
   This study presents some preliminary results on the applicability of the
   GLUE-MIKE SHE framework and associated constrained preliminary parameter
   and output uncertainty values. Focus was given to the influence of soil
   hydraulic parameters on the hydrological behaviour of a small study
   basin. The soil hydraulic parameters were predicted using various
   pedo-transfer-function approaches and moisture retention measurements in
   the laboratory, and these distributions were then confronted with ranges
   of the constrained effective parameters. For the latter, the
   restrictions that were imposed based on behavioural acceptance were
   substantial. All the traditional methods show significant uncertainty,
   due to heterogeneity and model error, which cannot be disregarded. The
   first results suggest a reasonable match among effective parameters and
   laboratory measurements. The use of pedo-transfer-function distributions
   as effective parameters, however, may provide unacceptable results, even
   with liberal criteria. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Field limits, tillage practices and ditch networks constitute man-made
   hydrological discontinuities in farmed catchments, and are expected to
   influence hydrological response during flood events. The purpose of this
   study is to assess the role of human impact, especially the existence of
   tillage practices and ditch network, on flood events. The study area is
   the farmed catchment of Roujan (0.91 km(2)) located in Southern France
   for which a spatially distributed hydrological model, MHYDAS, was
   developed and tested. The model considers the catchment as a series of
   interconnected field parts linked to the ditch network. Descriptions are
   provided for the main model procedures: computation of Hortonian excess
   rainfall on fields using the Green and Ampt approach, conversion of
   excess rainfall to surface runoff, interaction between ditch network and
   groundwater using a simple Darcian model and flood routing through the
   ditch network using the diffusive wave model. To analyse the role of
   both tillage practices and the ditch network, two sets of sensitivity
   analysis of the model were applied. The first set studied the role of
   tillage practices by comparing the actual spatial distribution of
   tillage practices on the catchment with three hypothetical scenarios.
   The second set studied the role of the ditch network by comparing the
   actual man-made ditch network with a hypothetical drainage network
   automatically extracted from a digital elevation model. Results show the
   importance of the role of tillage and the ditch network on the form of
   the hydrograph, the lag time, the runoff volume and the peak discharge.
   This technique could also be applied to study the impact of land use
   change on the hydrological behaviour of the catchment. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The expanding use and increased complexity of hydrological runoff models
   has given rise to a concern about overparameterization and risks for
   compensating errors. One proposed way out is the calibration and
   validation against additional observations, such as snow, soil moisture,
   groundwater or water quality. A general problem, however, when
   calibrating the model against more than one variable is the strategy for
   parameter estimation. The most straightforward method is to calibrate
   the model components sequentially. Recent results show that in this way
   the model may be locked up in a parameter setting, which is good enough
   for one variable but excludes proper simulation of other variables. This
   is particularly the case for water quality modelling, where a small
   compromise in terms of runoff simulation may lead to dramatically better
   simulations of water quality. This calls for an integrated model
   calibration procedure with a criterion that integrates more aspects on
   model performance than just river runoff.
   The use of multi-variable parameter estimation and internal control of
   the HBV hydrological model is discussed and highlighted by two case
   studies. The first example is from a forested basin in northern Sweden
   and the second one is from an agricultural basin in the south of the
   country. A new calibration strategy, which is integrated rather than
   sequential, is proposed and tested. It is concluded that comparison of
   model results with more measurements than only runoff can lead to
   increased confidence in the physical relevance of the model, and that
   the new calibration strategy can be useful for further model
   development. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The conceptual rainfall runoff model TAC (tracer-aided catchment model)
   has been developed based on the experimental results of tracer
   hydrological investigations at the mountainous Brugga and Zastler basins
   (40 and 18.4 km(2)). The model contains a physically realistic
   description of the runoff generation, which includes seven unit types
   each with characteristic dominating runoff generation processes. These
   processes are conceptualized by different linear and non-linear
   reservoir concepts. The model is applied to a period of 3.2 years on a
   daily time step with good success. In addition, an extensive model
   validation procedure was executed. Therefore, additional information
   (i.e. runoff in subbasins and a neighbouring basin, tracer
   concentrations and calculated runoff components) was used besides the
   simulated discharge of the basin investigated. This study shows the
   potential of tracer data for hydrological modelling. On the one hand,
   they are good tools to investigate the runoff generation processes. This
   is the basis for developing more realistic conceptualizations of the
   runoff generation routine. On the other hand, tracer data can serve as
   multi-response data to assess and validate a model. Copyright (C) 2002

Abstract = {{This study uses field observations of the extent of saturated area over
   limited areas of the small Uhlirska catchment (1.87 km(2)) in the Czech
   Republic in calibrating the parameters of a version of TOPMODEL. The
   field information is used within the GLUE methodology, which involves
   evaluating many different randomly chosen parameter sets within the
   chosen model structure. The different parameter sets are evaluated on
   performance in both discharge prediction and prediction of the observed
   saturated areas using appropriate likelihood measures. The results show
   that the saturated area information results in a strong constraint of
   the transmissivity parameter of the model, but that the other parameters
   show good fits across most of the range over which they are sampled.
   Quite different posterior distributions for the transmissivity parameter
   are found for the two different years of data used in conditioning the
   model. The effect on the prediction bounds for stream discharges is much
   less, perhaps because the transmissivity parameter combines with
   different values of the other parameters in the two years to capture the
   dominant modes of discharge response of the catchment. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, a disaggregation approach is suggested for the task of
   modelling hydrological responses within a spatially and temporally
   variable environment. With such an approach, large-scale environmental
   characteristics are tested for their ability to provide insight into the
   dominant physical mechanisms responsible for observed catchment
   responses. Using a regional-scale catchment in eastern Australia as a
   case study, the approach is firstly used to determine the utility of
   physical catchment data, and its organization in space, to provide
   insight into the compartmentalization of soil water storage within the
   catchment. In a second application, temporal disaggregation of the
   rainfall-runoff record into the cold-wet and warm-dry phases of the El
   Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is utilized to provide an
   objective comparison between alternative model structures, based on the
   `consistency' of model parameters in describing the effect of ENSO phase
   on water yield. Finally, combining the improved spatial representation
   of hydrological response with the model structure identified by temporal
   analysis is shown to result in a predictive framework whose level of
   uncertainty is lower than either of the individual strategies, and whose
   responses are consistent with the available evidence. It is noted that
   such modelling insight is unlikely to have been gained with traditional
   modelling strategies that seek to force a predetermined model structure
   to `fit' the observed data. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional model representing flow and nitrate transport in
   groundwater was developed and applied to a hillslope of the Kervidy
   catchment. The objective of the modelling was: (1) to characterize
   better the flow and nitrate transport in the groundwater and to
   determine the characteristic times of the system; (2) to explore the
   consequences of changes in nitrate leaching to groundwater on nitrate
   concentration in stream water. The finite-difference code MODFLOW was
   used to simulate the distribution of hydraulic head within the
   groundwater. Nitrate transport was described by the convection equation
   solved using MT3D. MODPATH was also used to analyse flow paths and
   travel times in the groundwater. Four units were considered in the
   model: (i) the plough layer, (ii) the soil, (iii) the weathered shale
   and (iv) the fissured shale. Autotrophic denitrification in the shale
   and partly in the weathered shale was represented, as well as
   heterotrophic denitrification in the upper horizon of bottom land. A
   steady-state average flow was assumed with a spatially uniform
   groundwater recharge of 2 mm day(-1), corresponding to the winter mean
   daily recharge observed in the Kervidy catchment. Nitrate recharge rate
   was fixed at 100 mg l(-1), which is equivalent to a nitrogen flux of 165
   kg ha(-1) year(-1). Six scenarios of nitrate leaching changes were
   analysed with the model. The first two correspond to spatially uniform
   decreases of the nitrate recharge rate to 80 and 60 mg l(-1),
   respectively. In the other four scenarios, nitrate recharge rate was
   spatially distributed along the hillslope so that the average nitrogen
   flux remained equal to 165 kg ha(-1) year(-1). Simulated hydraulic heads
   were similar to observed values along the hillslope, except for the
   summit. The transport model reproduced the spatial pattern of nitrate
   concentrations observed in the weathered shale groundwater, a deviation
   appearing only in the nearest piezometer to the stream. Travel times
   within the groundwater appeared to be highly variable, from a few days
   up to 3 years. Scenario analysis showed that a significant decrease of
   stream nitrate concentration can be expected following a global decrease
   in nitrate leaching along the hillslope. However, the fall could be very
   gradual in time. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A new integrated hydrological and nitrogen model, called TNT2
   (topography-based nitrogen transfer and transformation), has been
   developed to study nitrogen fluxes in small catchments. This model,
   process-based and spatially distributed in order to take spatial
   interactions into account, has been kept as simple as possible. Here,
   only the hydrological module is discussed. The two main hypotheses of
   the hydrological model are taken from the TOPMODEL concept (constant
   hydraulic gradient equal to slope and hydraulic conductivity decreasing
   exponentially with depth). The model is based on a daily water balance
   for each cell of a regular square grid and computes an explicit
   cell-to-cell routing. Transfer through the vadose zone is simulated
   using a conceptual, layer-based algorithm analogous to the Burns model,
   except that a drainage water reservoir has been added to simulate
   mobile/immobile water processes and variations of the water table within
   the soil. The crop growth and nitrogen transformations are simulated
   using the equations of a generic plant-soil model, STICS. As an example,
   a preliminary study of the effect of the catchment geomorphology on
   denitrification is presented. The study was performed on theoretical
   catchments with contrasted slope shapes and pathway patterns. Results
   show that the whole-catchment denitrification depends on catchment
   geomorphology, although not directly through the extent of saturated
   areas. It is concluded that TNT2 seems to be a powerful tool to explore
   catchment processes, both by application to actual cases and by
   exploration on simple scenarios. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{There are several indications that changes in land cover have influenced
   the hydrological regime of various river basins. In addition, the
   effects of climate change on the hydrological cycle and on the runoff
   behaviour of river catchments have been discussed extensively in recent
   years. However, it is at present rather uncertain how, how much and at
   which spatial scale these environmental changes are likely to affect the
   generation of storm runoff, and consequently the flood discharges of
   rivers. Firstly, this paper gives an overview of the possible effects of
   climatic and land-use change on storm runoff generation. Secondly, it
   discusses models dealing with the hydrological response to climate and
   land-use variations, including both the downscaling of climate
   information from global circulation models and the way flood forecasting
   models represent land-use conditions. Finally, two modelling studies of
   meso-scale catchments in Germany are presented: the first shows the
   possible impacts of climate change on storm runoff production, and the
   second the impacts of land-use changes. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Discharge, water table depth, and soil moisture content have been
   observed at a high spatial and temporal resolution in a 44 ha catchment

   observations in the first 3 months (period A), two distinct soil
   moisture models are identified and calibrated: a linear stochastic
   time-varying state-space model, and a geo-statistical model. Both models
   are defined at various spatial and temporal resolutions. For the
   subsequent period of 2 months (period B), four different ways to predict
   the soil moisture dynamics in the catchment are compared: (1) the
   application of the dynamic models in open-loop form; (2) a
   re-calibration of the dynamic models with soil moisture data in period
   B, and subsequent prediction in open-loop form; (3) prediction with the
   geo-statistical models, using the soil moisture data in period 13 (4)
   prediction by combining the outcomes of (1) and (3) via generalized
   cross-validation. The last method, which is a form of data assimilation,
   compares favourably with the three alternatives. Over a range of
   resolutions, the predictions by data assimilation have overall
   uncertainties that are approximately half that of the other prediction
   methods and have a favourable error structure (i.e. close to Gaussian)
   over space as well as time. In addition, data assimilation gives optimal
   predictions at finer resolutions compared with the other methods.
   Compared with prediction with the models in open-loop form, both
   re-calibration with soil moisture observations and data assimilation
   result in enhanced discharge predictions, whereas the prediction of
   ground water depths is not improved. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons,

Title = {{A simple model of river meandering and its comparison to natural
   channels}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-26}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We develop a new method for analysis of meandering channels based on
   planform sinuosity. This analysis objectively identifies three
   channel-reach lengths based on sinuosity measured at those lengths: the
   length of typical, simple bends: the length of long, often compound
   bends; and the length of several bends in sequence that often evolve
   from compound bends to form multibend loops. These lengths, when
   normalized by channel width, tend to fall into distinct and clustered
   ranges for different natural channels. Mean sinuosity at these lengths
   also falls into distinct ranges. That range is largest for the third and
   greatest length, indicating that, for some streams, multibend loops are
   important for planform sinuosity, whereas for other streams, multibend
   loops are less important. The role of multibend loops is seldom
   addressed in the literature, and they are not well predicted by previous
   modelling efforts. Also neglected by previous modelling efforts is
   bank-flow interaction and its role in meander evolution. We introduce a
   simple river meandering model based on topographic steering that has
   more in common with cellular approaches to channel braiding and
   landscape evolution modelling than to rigorous, physics-based analyses
   of river meandering. The model is sufficient to produce reasonable
   meandering channel evolution and predicts compound bend and multibend
   loop formation similar to that observed in nature. in both mechanism and
   importance for planform sinuosity. In the model, the tendency to form
   compound bends is sensitive to the relative magnitudes of two lengths
   governing meander evolution: (i) the distance between the bend
   cross-over and the zone of maximum bank shear stress, and (ii) the bank
   shear stress dissipation length related to bank roughness. In our simple
   model, the two lengths are independent. This sensitivity implies that
   the tendency for natural channels to form compound bends may be greater
   When the banks are smoother. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses a variety of multivariate statistical techniques in
   order to improve current understanding of the antecedent and rainfall
   controls on drainage characteristics for an agricultural underdrained
   clay site. Using the dataset obtained from a two-year hillslope study at
   Wytham (Oxfordshire, UK) a number of patterns in the nature and style of
   drainage events were explored. First, using principal components
   analysis, a distinction was drawn between drainflow controlled by
   antecedent conditions and drainflow controlled by rainfall
   characteristics. Dimensional analysis then distinguished between two
   further types of drainflow event: antecedent limited events (ALE) and
   non-antecedent limited events (NALE). These were drainflow events
   requiring a minimum antecedent hydraulic head to occur (ALE) and events
   that occurred in response to rainfall irrespective of the antecedent
   conditions, because the rainfall was either of high enough intensity or
   duration to prompt a response in drainflow (NALE).
   The dataset also made possible a preliminary investigation into the
   controls on and types of macropore flow at the site. Principal
   components analysis identified that rainfall characteristics were more
   important than antecedent conditions in generating high proportions of
   macropore flow in drainflow. Of the rainfall characteristics studied,
   rainfall amount and intensity were the dominant controls on the amount
   of macropore flow, with duration as a secondary control. Two styles of
   macropore flow were identified: intensity-driven and duration-driven.
   Intensity-driven events are characterized by rainfall of high intensity
   and short duration. During such events the amount of macropore flow is
   proportional to the rainfall intensity and the interaction between
   macropore and matrix flow is kinetically limited. The second style of
   macropore flow is characterized by long-duration events. For these
   events the amount of macropore flow approaches a maximum value whatever
   the rainfall duration. This suggests that these events are characterized
   by an equilibrium interaction between macropores and matrix flow.

Abstract = {{The embanked floodplains of the lower River Rhine in the Netherlands
   contain large amounts of heavy metals, which is a result of many years
   deposition of contaminated overbank sediments. Depending on local
   sedimentation rates and changing pollution trends in the past, the metal
   pollution varies greatly between different floodplain sections as well
   as vertically within the floodplain soil profiles. Maximum metal
   concentrations in floodplain soils vary from 30 to 130 mg/kg for Cu,
   from 70 to 490 mg/kg for Pb and from 170 to 1450 mg/kg for Zn. In the
   present study these metals were used as a tracer to reconstruct
   sedimentation rates at 28 sites on the lower River Rhine floodplains.
   The temporal trend in pollution of the lower River Rhine over the past
   150 years was reconstructed on the basis of metal concentrations in
   sediments from small ponds within the floodplain area. Using a
   one-dimensional sedimentation model, average sedimentation rates over
   the past century were determined using an inverse modelling calibration
   procedure. The advantage of this method is that it uses information over
   an entire profile, it requires only a limited number of samples, it
   accounts for post-depositional redistribution of the metals, and it
   provides quantitative estimates of the precision of the sedimentation
   rates obtained. Estimated sedimentation rates vary between about 0.2
   mm/year and 15 mm/year. The lowest metal concentrations are found in the
   distal parts of floodplain sections with low flooding frequencies and
   where average sedimentation rates have been less than about 5 mm/year.
   The largest metal accumulations occur in low-lying floodplain sections
   where average sedimentation rates have been more than 10 mm/year.

Abstract = {{Over a period of 12 months, soil moisture content and potential was
   monitored in an annual-grass-dominated 20 ha catchment in order to
   determine flow paths leading to exfiltration at the catchment outlet.
   Water was found to enter the catchment valley either through flow
   originating in the slopes or through surface infiltration during
   rainfall events. Although subsurface flow from the slopes to the
   catchment outlet occurred throughout the year, surface recharge was
   restricted to a few events during the wet season. In the deeper
   saturated profile of the valley, now was directed upwards along the
   valley edges and gradually became horizontal towards the central axis of
   the valley. During the peak of the rainfall season, horizontal flow
   close to the catchment outlet intercepted the gradually sloping surface,
   resulting in exfiltration. Plants influenced the hydrology of the
   catchment by removing moisture from the root zone during spring and
   early summer, resulting in evapotranspiration losses from the vadose
   zone. Heterogeneities within the valley soil were evident as
   variable-permeability layers that resulted in a seasonally confined
   water table within the valley. This investigation shows that the vadose
   zone plays an important role in redistributing surface recharge and
   emphasizes the importance of accounting for effective moisture in
   low-yielding catchments with ephemeral surface runoff. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{A water budget was established for the open, undisturbed bog Stormossen,
   central Sweden, for the growing seasons of 1996 and 1997 as a part of
   the NOPEX project. The water budget was complemented with data on the
   spatial variation of groundwater levels and water contents in different
   microrelief elements (ridge, hollow and ridge margin). The seasonal (24
   May to 4 October) rainfall, evaporation and runoff were 200, 256, and 43
   turn in 1996, respectively, and 310, 286 and 74 mm in 1997, giving
   negative budgets of -99 mm in 1996 and -50 mm in 1997. Approximately
   60\% of the total budget was caused by storage changes in the upper 40
   cm of the bog and 40\% by swelling/shrinking in the layers below. This
   `mire breathing' must be incorporated in future models of mire-water
   dynamics. The water content varied diversely among the different
   microrelief elements, much depending on the properties of moss and peat
   together with distance to water table. There also was a strong
   hysteresis in the relationships between groundwater level and measured
   volumetric water content, depending partly on pore-throat effects and
   partly on swelling/shrinking of the peat matrix. A seasonal variation of
   volumetric water content in a layer beneath water table was found to be
   larger than what could be justified by compression alone. We think that
   probable causes could be methane gas expansion together with temperature
   effects. The main conclusions of this study were: (i) water-transport
   and storage characteristics are distinctly different among hummocks,
   ridges and hollows, (ii) mire wetness cannot be deduced from groundwater
   levels only, and (iii) an important part of the total water storage was
   caused by swelling/shrinking of the peat, not by changes in unsaturated
   water content. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A paired catchment study was conducted over a 10-year period on the
   hydrology of an exotic Pinus plantation in the coastal lowlands of
   south-east Queensland, Australia. Each catchment was instrumented with a
   stream monitoring station, tipping bucket rain gauge, and a network of
   piezometers to monitor the shallow perched water table. After a 6-year
   calibration period a harvest treatment was imposed on one catchment
   (Review): clearfelling approximately 90\% of the catchment area. which
   contained a mature (44-year-old) Pinus elliottii plantation. This
   subsequently was re-established with a second rotation plantation of a
   hybrid of P. elliottii x P. caribaea var. hondurensis. The control
   catchment (Crayfish) contained a P. elliottii plantation similar to that
   clearfelled at Review. The post-harvest period was monitored for a
   further 4 years.
   Evapotranspiration was found to be the major output flux, with stream
   flow only a minor component of the study catchments' water budget. Areas
   with gleyed podzolic soils were found to remain waterlogged for periods
   up to 7 months following the seasonally high summer rainfall period,
   with other soils having water logging periods of only a few months.
   Little change was observed in waterlogging characteristics following
   harvesting, in contrast to stream flow which increased for 3 years but
   with evidence of a decline after 5 years.
   The perched-watertable piezometric surface indicated that its lateral
   drainage differs from that or surface flows, the perched-watertable
   drainage fluxes from the study catchments seem minor and off-site
   movement of solutes (e.g. nutrients and contaminants) via them would be
   limited. It was identified that the interaction between the perched and
   deep aquifers was poorly understood, as well as the relative importance
   of the soil moisture storage of the aquitard clay layer between them. It
   was concluded that there is a need to undertake more detailed analysis
   using modelling, and to obtain additional field data on soil-layer
   properties and piezometric levels of the deep aquifer. Copyright (C)

Title = {{Systematic variation of soil infiltration rates within and between the

Abstract = {{Vegetation mosaics have commonly been thought to include two principal
   zones with distinctly different hydrology: relatively bare and
   impermeable runoff source zones (intergroves) and more strongly
   absorbing vegetated runon zones (groves). However, the data required to
   verify the internal uniformity of hydrologic response within these
   components of mosaic landscapes have been lacking, as have data on the
   nature (abrupt or gradational) of the boundaries between them. This
   study examines the degree of internal uniformity of key soil properties
   in the intergroves and groves of an Australian vegetation mosaic.
   Infiltration rates, soil water content, shear strength, bulk density and
   texture were determined at intervals of 1.5-2.5 m across several
   grove-intergrove cycles of an Australian banded shrubland. Results
   demonstrate that order-of-magnitude variability in soil infiltration
   rates can occur across intergroves, with lesser variation in groves.
   Patterns of infiltration are systematically related to slope position.
   Rates are relatively high in the uppermost parts of the intergrove, and
   fall to low values only in the lowermost intergrove where soils are
   mechanically strong. Infiltration rates increase rapidly from the
   lowermost intergrove to reach maxima within the upper to middle grove,
   from where rates once again decline toward the next intergrove. However,
   there is only a gradational change in infiltration rates across the
   pioneer zone-grove boundary, which is the sharpest of the mosaic
   boundaries when identified using plant cover data.
   Hydrologic models built on the presumption that mapped plant cover units
   are equally distinct hydrologically may need to be refined to
   incorporate the presence of systematic internal variability of
   infiltration rates and gradational change in soil hydraulic properties,

Abstract = {{Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a highly accurate and automatable
   method for determination of porous media water content and electrical
   conductivity. Water content is inferred from the dielectric permittivity
   of the medium, whereas electrical conductivity is inferred from TDR
   signal attenuation. Empirical and dielectric mixing models are used to
   relate water content to measured dielectric permittivity. Clay and
   organic matter bind substantial amounts of water, such that measured
   bulk dielectric constant is reduced and the relationship with total
   water content requires individual calibration. A variety of TDR probe
   configurations provide users with site- and media-specific options.
   Advances in TDR technology and in other dielectric methods offer the
   promise not only for less expensive and more accurate tools for
   electrical determination of water and solute contents, but also a host
   or other properties such as specific surface area, and retention
   properties of porous media. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},
