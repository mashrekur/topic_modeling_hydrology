Abstract = {{The spatial correlation of a series of sedimentary fecal stanols and
   sterols data obtained from 39 surface sediment sampling stations in the
   eastern waters of Hong Kong was analysed by geostatistical techniques.
   Coprostanol {[}5 beta] (5 beta(H)-holestan-3 beta-ol), cholestanol {[}5
   alpha] (5 alpha(H)-colestan-3 beta-ol) and cholesterol abundantly found
   in human feces were used as molecular markers for sewage pollution
   monitoring in the coastal sediments. The {[}5 beta/(5 beta + 5 alpha)]
   ratio in the study area was found to range from 0.04 to 0.61 ((x) over
   bar = 0.27) and that of {[}5 beta/(5 alpha + cholesterol)] ranged from
   0.02 to 0.73 ((x) over bar = 0.19). Semi-variograms of the two ratios
   were found to fit isotropic spherical models: for {[}5 beta/(5 beta + 5
   alpha)]: c(0) = 4 x 10(-3), c = 6.5 x 10(-3) a = 12000, D-c = -0.024 and
   R = 0.91; for 5 beta/(5 alpha + cholesterol): c(0) = 7.5 x 10(-3), c =
   8.5 x 10(-3), a = 25000, D-c = -0.061 and R = 0.67. Because of the more
   precise covariance model produced, the former stanol/sterol ratio was
   adopted as the sewage pollution marker for the kriging of contour map
   for sewage pollution. Three major sources of sewage pollution in the
   eastern waters of Hong Kong were highlighted, they were the densely
   populated Victoria Harbour, the sludge disposal site and the Inner Mirs
   Bay. A detailed dispersion pattern of sewage pollution around the sludge
   disposal site was studied. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of
   kriging in providing a holistic picture on the extent and spatial
   correlation of sewage pollution in coastal marine environment. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Drinking water and even mineral water may contain boron until a few ppm
   and WHO has recommended a limit of 0.3 mg boron l(-1). The treatment by
   the resin Amberlite IRA743 seems to be the most convenient. Water
   deboronation with this resin has been revisited through laboratory
   column experiments, especially for low boron concentrations. Given that
   the resin bears weakly basic anion exchange groups, the specificity of
   the treatment is not obvious. For mineral waters, it is important that
   the ionic composition remains constant. It is shown here that anion
   exchange reactions occur but may be neglected when the water has
   sufficient ionic strength and/or being gasified with carbon dioxide.
   Thus, the treatment with Amberlite IRA743 is convenient, but it requires
   to be authorized in France and the minimization of regeneration
   solutions has still to be improved. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Several computer programs for modelling water distribution networks have
   been developed which incorporate a facility for modelling chlorine
   decay. Problems have been experienced with the calibration and
   durability of these models due to both temporal and spatial variability
   in the decay constants. Chlorine will decay either due to reactions at
   the pipe wall or due to reactions in the bulk water. The aim of the work
   presented in this paper is to investigate the factors which influence
   bulk decay. Over 200 determinations of bulk chlorine decay against time
   were performed on waters taken from 32 sampling locations within the
   Severn Trent region, U.K. The bulk decay constant was observed to show
   significant variation with temperature, the initial chlorine
   concentration and the organic content of the water. An equation was
   derived relating these parameters which could be used to update the
   decay constants in network models and improve their durability. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{A survey of 23 springs in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) of southern
   Ontario recorded chloride contamination levels, resulting from the
   winter application of road de-icing salt, ranging from <2 to >1200 mg
   l(-1). Chloride level measured in spring water was far more seasonally
   stable than that measured in surface (river) water, and thus the spatial
   pattern of Cl contamination indicated by the former was judged to be
   more reliable. Chloride contamination of groundwater in the GTA was
   strongly related to urbanisation, and at the four most affected springs
   increases of between 21 and 34\% were detected over the period November
   1996 to November 1997. The response of macroinvertebrates living in
   these springs to increasing salinity was examined with the aim of
   creating a biological index of contamination: the Chloride Contamination
   Index (CCI). A power function yielded a significant correlation between
   this index and the mean Cl concentration measured at each spring. Taxa
   were able to be categorised as either ``tolerant{''} or
   ``non-tolerant{''} of high Cl although none was unique to either end of
   the scale. However, from both field observations and salinity tolerance
   trials in the laboratory, the amphipod Gammarus pseudolimnaeus was found
   to be associated with source aquifers only mildly contaminated with Cl.
   Absence of this species from a spring, particularly if nymphs of the
   stonefly Nemoura trispinosa are present should indicate moderate to high
   contamination. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The disposal of excess sludge from waste water treatment plants
   represents a rising challenge in activated sludge processes. Hence, the
   minimization of excess sludge production was investigated by optimizing
   the process parameters. Laboratory scale experiments showed, that the
   excess sludge production was effected by the sludge loading and oxygen
   concentration. Therefore. a mathematical model that describes substrate
   removal, oxygen utilization, and excess sludge production within a
   microbial hoc particle, surrounded by biodegradable substrate, will be
   presented. After calibration of the model parameters, the model
   validation has been carried out with experimental results. The model
   takes into account the mass transfer of substrate oxygen, the biological
   reaction within the hoc particle, and the endogenous respiration
   process. So it allows a detailed calculation of the excess sludge
   production. The results indicate that the oxygen concentration in the
   bulk liquid has a significant effect on the amount of excess sludge
   produced. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{For the computation of extreme event statistics with respect to
   pollutant loads and environmental effects, the uncertainty in model
   parameters of deterministic models and the inherent stochastic
   variability in input variables have to be taken into account. Two
   stochastic reliability methods-combinations of the First Order
   Reliability Method (FORM) with Directional Simulation with Importance
   Sampling (FORM/DIS) or with Latin Hypercube Sampling (FORM/LHS)-were
   used for risk analysis related to acute environmental effects. The range
   of probabilities of exceedence at which these combined methods are more
   efficient than crude Monte Carlo simulation (CMC) or Latin Hypercube
   Sampling (LHS) only, was investigated. Their efficiency in relation to
   the required number of model simulations to accurately estimate the
   small exceedence probabilities of extremes compared to that of Monte
   Carlo simulation was demonstrated with two case studies: (1) to estimate
   exceedence probabilities of limit pollutant concentrations in a lake
   after a loading event using a simple numerical model. At exceedence
   probabilities smaller than 0.1 both FORM/DIS and FORM/LHS gave more
   accurate results than crude Monte Carlo simulation, and this improvement
   increased rapidly with decreasing probabilities. (2) to estimate the
   frequencies of occurrence of extremely low dissolved oxygen (DO)
   concentrations in a stream receiving multiple COD loads from combined
   sewer overflows and storm water outlets using a Dissolved Oxygen Stream
   MOdel (DOSMO). In this example the relationships between stochastic
   parameters and the model output are strongly non-linear and the number
   of loading events that determine the in-stream DO concentration is
   variable. Here, FORM/LHS was more efficient than than FORM/DIS in
   estimating very small probabilities. A general limit value for the
   probability of exceedence below which FORM/LHS or FORM/DIS were more
   efficient than Crude Monte Carlo simulation and Latin Hypercube Sampling
   could not be given, but they were lower for the complex stream DO model
   than for the simple lake model. Based on these very different case
   studies it is concluded that the methods can generally be applied to a
   large Variety of numerical models within the field of environmental
   engineering. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two concerns in remediating tetrachloroethene (PCE)-contaminated sites
   are the stimulation of PCE degradation and the effect of other
   contaminants on PCE degradation. In ethanol-fed microcosms receiving 8.3
   mu M PCE, increasing the yeast extract concentration from 2 to 100 mg
   L(-1) decreased the time required to produce cis-1,2-dichloroethene
   (DCE) from 36 to 9 days. The addition of 19 mu M carbon tetrachloride to
   microcosms completely inhibited PCE degradation, as did 4 mu M
   chloroform although 0.7 mu M chloroform was not inhibitory.
   PCE-degrading capability had not developed in a column receiving carbon
   tetrachloride after 161 days although carbon tetrachloride was
   transformed to chloroform and dichloromethane. Once carbon tetrachloride
   was removed and the yeast extract concentration increased, PCE
   degradation to cis-1,2-DCE was observed within 45 days, although
   measurable degradation of cis-1,2-DCE to vinyl chloride and ethene
   required another 130 days. These results suggest that multiple-zone
   remediation strategies may be required for sites contaminated with
   mixtures of PCE, carbon tetrachloride and/or chloroform. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{In this work precipitation of calcium carbonates, influenced by the
   addition of suspended mineral particles (quartz, kaolinite or
   montmorillonite) is reported. In the investigated systems the initial
   concentrations of calcium and carbonate species, as well as the
   concentration of NaCl, were similar to those in seawater. In the
   reference system, to which no mineral particles were added, vaterite was
   the only solid phase precipitating. Quartz and kaolinite had no
   influence on precipitation, while the addition of calcium
   montmorillonite caused an instantaneous precipitation of calcite. This
   was taken as an indication that montmorillonite is a suitable substrate
   for the overgrowth of this polymorph.
   The progress of precipitation was followed by measuring the pH value of
   the solution, while the solid phases were analyzed by means of X-ray
   diffraction and FT-IR spectroscopy. The samples of calcite were
   additionally characterized by means of the electron spin resonance
   spectroscopy, which revealed distortions of the crystal lattice of the
   calcite epitaxially grown on montmorillonite. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The wastewater treatment in the fertilizer factory in Kutina (Croatia)
   is carried out by an ion exchange process using strong acid cation and
   weak basic anion ion exchangers. The regeneration of cation exchange
   resin is performed by 56\% HNO3 while the anion resin regeneration is
   done by 16\% ammonium hydroxide as an external regeneration process.
   The wastewater in the investigation period contained a high content of
   nitrogen in ammonium form (with an average of 325 mg l(-1) N-NH4+) as
   well as nitrogen in nitrate form (with an average of 201 mg l(-1)
   N-NO3). After treatment, the wastewater contained 8.7 mg l(-1) of
   ammonium nitrogen and 7.0 mg l(-1) of nitrate nitrogen and with the
   conductivity of 150 mu S cm(-1) it is added into the cooling water
   system.
   As the nitrogen in collected wastewater is very high, the dilution is
   done prior to the ion exchange processing. The treated wastewater is a
   better choice for dilution process than decarbonisated water. In this
   case the exchange capacity of cation resin is higher by 9.3\%.
   Four types of anion resin were used at the wastewater treatment plant.
   The influence of 2\% HNO3 on LEWATIT S 4428 ion exchange resin was
   examined under laboratory conditions. Due to the effect of 2\% HNO3 on
   LEWATIT S 4428 anion resin during 24 days the exchange capacity
   decreased from the initial 1.19 mol l(-1) to a final 0.71 mol l(-1).
   The dynamic contact of 2\% HNO3 with the same anion resin in the column
   results also in a decrease of the exchange capacity by 32\%. This
   confirms the harmful influence of nitrogen acid on the nitrate binding
   capacity and resin stability.
   Four types of anion resins were used under industrial conditions. Under
   dynamic equilibrium the best results were obtained with the LEWATIT S
   4428 resin. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The ballasting of activated and alum sludge with bentonite,
   clinoptilolite, montmorillonite, acid modified magnesium silicate, and a
   blend of talc and chlorite was investigated in batch settling tests.
   Mineral materials were added as such, and saturated by Ca or Na ions.
   The sludge settleability was also investigated when soluble cations were
   added as salts. Single cation solutions of Ca or Na, or combined
   mixtures of Ca, Na, K, and Mg were used. The impact of mineral materials
   on alum sludge filterability was tested by capillary suction lime (CST)
   measurement. Mineral materials, except bentonite and test sand, improved
   activated and alum sludge settling by 21-47\% based on sludge volume
   when a dosage of 3 g/l was used. Cation saturation of mineral material,
   except bentonite, did not change the settling improvement. Sludge
   settleability was unaffected by soluble cation addition as salts.
   Clinoptilolite, the blend of talc and chlorite, and montmorillonite
   improved most the activated sludge settling. Montmorillonite, the blend
   of talc and chlorite, and the acid modified magnesium silicate improved
   most the alum sludge settling. Differences in density, particle size, or
   the amount of soluble cations did not explain alone the ranking of
   mineral materials in settleability improvement. Alum sludge
   filterability was affected only by bentonite as such and by Na-saturated
   bentonite to negative direction. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Biosorption of Cd by biomass of the brown seaweeds Durvillaea, Laminaria
   Ecklonia and Homosira presaturated with Ca. Mg or K was coupled with the
   release of these light ions. The feasibility of biomass pre-treatment to

   performance, the degree of its component leaching (measured by the
   weight loss and TOC) as well as by the number of ion-exchange sites
   remaining in the biomass after the pre-treatment. Multicomponent
   Langmuir and ion exchange models applied to the equilibrium sorption
   data for pH 4.5 confirmed the ion exchange mechanism involved in the
   biosorption of metals. Both models fitted well the experimental data and
   their parameters can be used in the derivation of dimensionless
   ion-exchange isotherms which are instrumental in predicting the behavior
   of the biosorbents in dynamic flow-through biosorption systems. The
   sequence of biomass affinities established for the selected heavy metals
   can be correlated with the chemical pretreatment of the biomass. (C)

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{205-215}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The performance of different two-stage systems was compared for the
   treatment of synthetic wastewater. The first stage was a completely
   mixed reactor without sludge retention for the stimulation of dispersed
   bacterial growth. The second stage was an activated sludge system in
   which growth of protozoa and metazoa was stimulated. Solid-liquid
   separation was achieved either by sedimentation (conventional activated
   sludge (CAS) system) or submerged membrane filtration (membrane-assisted
   bioreactor (MBR) system). Some 80\% of the chemical oxygen demand (COD)
   was removed in the first stage at volumetric loading rates up to 1.6 g
   COD l(-1) d(-1). In case the subsequent stage was conventional activated
   sludge, a further COD decrease was noticed. In case of a subsequent MBR
   system, however, the dissolved COD concentration tended to increase due
   to the retention of organics by the membrane. In the first stage of both
   systems, most of the nitrogen and phosphate was used for biomass
   incorporation. Increased mineralization by protozoa and metazoa in the
   second stage resulted in a partial release of nitrogen and phosphate to
   the effluent. The MBR system yielded a 20-30\% lower sludge production
   than the CAS system under similar conditions of solids retention time
   and organic loading rate. This was attributed to the higher amount of
   predators in the second stage of the MBR configuration. However, the
   increased grazing of predators on nitrifying bacteria can result in
   overgrazing of the latter population. Overall, the two-phase system
   based on conventional activated sludge had as major point of weakness
   the wash-out of suspended solids, while the one based on the MBR was
   hampered by too intensive grazing on the nitrifiers, increased N and P
   concentrations and wash-out of soluble but humified COD. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{This laboratory experiment systematically examines As speciation and
   solubility in sewage sludge suspensions as affected by pH and redox
   potential (Eh). Under oxidizing conditions, As solubility was low with
   the major portion of soluble As present as organic species;
   dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA) was always the dominant organic species.
   Under moderately reducing conditions (0-100 mV), arsenite a as the major
   inorganic As species in solution and As solubility significantly
   increased due to dissolution of iron oxyhydroxides. Upon reduction to
   -250 mV, As solubility was controlled by the formation of insoluble
   sulfides and as a result soluble As contents dramatically decreased as
   compared to levels measured at 0 mV. Speciation was drastically
   influenced by pH. Soluble As was maximum at a neutral pH value and
   decreased under both more acidic and alkaline concentrations. At pH 5.0,
   inorganic species were the dominant forms in solution, however, at pH
   6.5, organic species were the major soluble forms. Alkaline conditions
   (pH 8.0) resulted in similar concentrations of soluble inorganic and
   organic As species. Arsenic biomethylation was measured at pH 6.5 and
   8.0, but was drastically restricted at pH 5.0. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

   screened as precursors of MX. The yields of MX by chlorination of
   syringaldehyde are the highest and decreased with chlorine dose, but the
   yields of MX by the other 7 compounds increased with chlorine dose. It
   may be possible to elucidate the reaction mechanism for the formation of

Abstract = {{Experiments using six large, outdoor, ponds were conducted from 2 August
   1993 to 10 September 1993 to examine whether the presence of omnivorous
   fish can affect the production of labile (DOCL) and refractory dissolved
   organic carbon (DOCR) by zooplankton excretion in a shallow eutrophic
   lake. Addition of goldfish (Carrasius auratus) to duplicate ponds at two
   densities (high density: 14.0 g C l(-1); low density: 1.6 g C l(-1))
   resulted in lower densities of large zooplankton (>100 mu m) and higher
   chlorophyll-a concentrations than in reference ponds without goldfish.
   Rapid density increases in numbers of large zooplankton in reference
   ponds were significantly correlated with decreases in chlorophyll-a
   concentration, and were followed by increases in total dissolved organic
   carbon (DOCT). While no relationship between density of large
   zooplankton and chloraphyll-a concentrations in high- or low-density
   ponds was observed due to reduced feeding pressure on large zooplankton
   by goldfish, DOCT concentrations remained at levels 30-220\% higher than
   those in reference ponds after the 15th day. Although DOCT and DOCL
   concentrations in apparent steady state in high- and low-density ponds
   were significantly higher than those in reference ponds (P < 0.05), no
   significant difference in DOCR concentration was observed. Estimates
   suggest that the enhanced DOCT production rates are mainly attributable
   to excretion by small zooplankton (100 mu m >), which may also enhance
   DOCT production in eutrophic lakes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This investigation demonstrates that in situ respirometry can be an
   effective tool to manage the removal of an inhibitory substrate in a
   sequencing batch reactor (SBR). Data collected enabled the determination
   of an optimum operating cycle for the effective treatment of a synthetic
   wastewater containing up to 1300 mg/l phenol as the sole carbon source.
   Oxygen uptake rates were monitored in situ at various stages of a
   bench-scale sequencing batch reactor. Respirometry was used as an
   indicator of microbial activity and substrate utilisation. Although the
   profile of the Oxygen Uptake Rate (OUR) followed closely that of phenol
   substrate removal, any correlation between the OUR and soluble residual
   substrate COD was specific to that system. A high OUR Value corresponded
   to the feed period; at the end of the cycle, when the substrate was
   depleted, the OUR Value was low. A plot of OUR values provided a good
   indication of the biological activity in the reactior.
   It was possible to select an optimum operating cycle using the oxygen
   uptake rates as an indicator for the removal of phenol. The initial
   operating cycle was 24 h, which included phases for filling, reaction,
   quiescence and decanting. From oxygen uptake rates and corresponding
   soluble COD values of the remaining substrate, data showed that the 4 h
   operating cycle was able to achieve similar substrate removal
   efficiencies. At a SBR loading rate of 3.12 kg phenol m(-3)d(-1),
   removal of 97\% COD was achieved at the end of the cycle. The reactor
   was operated at a SRT of 4-27 days with biomass concentrations ranging
   from 3500-3900 mg/l. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The abiotic sorption efficiency of on-site wastewater treatment systems
   can be improved by using a strongly sorbing filter material that, if it
   retains phosphorus (P) in a plant available way, can be used as
   fertiliser when P saturation is achieved. Two materials, blast furnace
   slag and the siliceous sedimentary rock opoka, have shown a high P
   sorption capacity and were included in a set of experiments to
   investigate the P retention mechanisms from model P-solution.
   Experiments focusing on the P sorption, capacity and calcium (Ca) and
   PO4 determination were carried out. The pH was also measured. The P
   sorption experiment showed that some slags were efficient P retainers,
   while the opoka was the least efficient P retainer. The pH decreased in
   all samples as a function of P addition. In the slag samples, the Ca
   concentration also decreased as a function of P addition, suggesting
   Ca-P precipitation as the major P removal mechanism for the slag. The Ca
   and PO4 speciation data ruled out the formation of amorphous calcium
   phosphates and/or octacalcium phosphate as the major P removal
   mechanism. However, the calculated ion activity products displayed clear
   evidence that hydroxyapatite had precipitated above a certain critical
   supersaturation limit. This would explain the poor P retention
   efficiency of the opoka samples in this study as the ion activity
   products were too low. The finding that direct hydroxyapatite formation
   is the predominant P removal mechanism might have important implications
   for their possible use as fertiliser due to the poor solubility of
   hydroxyapatite. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Natural organic matter (NOM) was isolated by reverse osmosis (RO) From
   the two inlet brooks and the outlet of Lake Terjevann with estimated
   recoveries of 85-90\%. The lake has been receiving liming treatments
   since 1980 due to the acidic drainage from the catchments.
   Highperformance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) analyses of the RO
   samples and of ultrafiltered fractions indicate that there are five main
   size fractions of carbon dth molecular weights between 410-1170 Da in
   all three samples. However. the molecular weight distributions differ
   significantly in that the outlet sample have lower proportions of larger
   molecular weight NOM than do the inlets. Studies of spectral absorption
   coefficients at 154 nm support this molecular size distribution.
   Absorption coefficients of the samples at both 254 and 410 nm decrease
   with decreasing molecular weight so that the ratio E-2/E-4 increases
   with decreasing molecular weight, This trend appears independent of pH
   changes and especially effects the absorption coefficients of the higher
   molecular weight NOM. Studies of C:N ratios of the RO samples and of
   ultrafiltered fractions indicate that the outlet RO sample and that the
   lower molecular weight NOM are enriched in nitrogen. Supported by
   studies of spectral absorption coefficients and C:N ratios of the total
   RO samples and ultrafiltered fractions and effects of FH changes on the
   ultrafiltered fractions, it is hypothesized that in-lake processes are
   removing larger molecular weight NOM. This is possibly an effect of the
   timing which increase pH and calcium(II) concentrations in the lake
   water coinciding with hydrolysis and precipitation of aluminium(III) and
   iron(III). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biofilm reactors containing gas-permeable tubings both for oxygen supply
   and as support material were used for the treatment of a wastewater
   spiked with chlorophenols as model compounds for poorly degradable
   xenobiotics. Objective of this work was to ascertain possibilities to
   enhance the performance of biofilm reactors in the case of shock loads.
   Under plug how conditions, the continuous how operation of one biofilm
   reactor (continuous flow biofilm reactor - CFBR) resulted in a
   stratification of biomass due to concentration gradients. Therefore, the
   effluent quality of a CFBR deteriorated as a result of break-through
   events attributed to the displacement of chlorophenols into sections of
   the reactor with low biomass or with microorganisms not well adapted to
   these compounds. For comparison reasons, a second, geometrically
   identical membrane biofilm reactor was operated discontiuously as
   sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR) to achieve a more homogeneous
   distribution of biomass. A higher stability of reactor performance
   became evident for the SBBR, if the reactors were subjected to
   periodically changing influent concentrations (at an interval of 12 h,
   i.e, the twofold of the theoretical residence time). It was shown that
   the sequencing batch reactor technology is very promising to handle
   strong fluctuations of influent conditions because of the flexibility of
   the operation schedule. In case of a shock load with up to 110 mg l(-1)
   4-monochlorophenol (MCP), an elimination of 99.5\% was obtained by
   prolonging the SBBR cycle from 6 to gh. For the CFBR, it was possible to
   avoid breakthrough events by recirculation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A superthickening device (solids bed height = 5.5-6.0 m) has been
   examined for potential use in concentrating an alum-based sludge
   generated during the production of potable water. Initial trials show
   that, even when flocculated using an appropriate dose of
   polyelectrolyte, the superthickened sludge settles to a solids content
   of only 3-4 wt\%. This concentration is equivalent to the sludge gel
   point and indicates that no significant sediment-based compression is
   taking place. However, when subjected to an in situ low shear rate (1
   rpm) stirring treatment, the polyelectrolyte-flocculated sludge
   consolidates to far higher concentrations, reaching 17 wt\% solids after
   60 h of thickening. Possible mechanisms underlying this result include
   the rearrangement and densification of the inter-particle network and
   suppression of liquid channels in the sediment bed. On a more
   qualitative level, this study also briefly considers the advantages of
   superthickeners over conventional mechanical dewatering methods and
   outlines a number of experimental considerations relevant to future
   research. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In pilot plant studies, permeates of ultrafiltration of boron- and
   ethanolamine-containing coolants were used as a carbon source for
   denitrification of NO2-N and NO3-N in the wastewater from
   electrochemical deburring after metal ion precipitation. Treatment of
   the two wastewater streams in a cascade of submerged fixed bed reactors
   at increasing pH-values revealed that a more alkaline pH resulted in a
   lower denitrification rate and an increasing nitrite concentration in
   the effluent. The DOC-removal efficiency was about 70\% for pH values of
   7.8-9. It was not possible to establish a nitrification. The biomass in
   the treated wastewater was fine-particulate and could hardly be
   separated.
   For evaluation of the maximal biodegradability of the DOC of the
   permeates in batch experiments, the long-term BOD instead of the BOD5
   was more suitable. Results of BOD21-detenminations corresponded with the
   DOG-removal efficiency of the immobilized population in the pilot plant
   at HRTs ranging from 3.9-13.5 d. Whereas the nitrate content of the
   EC-wastewater could be reduced completely, even at high loading rates,
   about 30\% of the COD of the permeates remained undegraded. A COD of
   <300 mg O-2/l could only be obtained after chemical oxidation of the
   effluent by UV-activated H2O2.
   Production-related Variations of the boron- and DOG-concentrations in
   the permeates of ultrafiltration of cooling lubricants apparently
   prevented the establishment of a nitrification of ammonia, that was
   released during denitrification with ethanolamines as a carbon source.
   Only when both wastewater streams were co-treated with a, only slightly
   polluted third, non-toxic wastewater stream of the factory, elimination
   of nitrate and ammonia from EC-wastewater and permeate, respectively,
   was successful. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Arsenic is listed as a hazardous material and is a suspect carcinogen,
   reportedly responsible for lung and skin cancers. It is also a
   teratogen, which means that it is capable of crossing the placental
   membrane into the metabolic system of unborn children. The level of
   arsenic allowed in drinking water has been set at 0.01 mg l by the World
   Health Organization (WHO). However, the maximum permissible limit of
   arsenic in drinking water of Bangladesh is 0.05 mg/l. The actual
   toxicity of arsenic to the human body varies depending on several
   factors as general health and diet. It is a cumulative substance, which
   slowly passes out of the body through mine, hair, fingernails/toenails
   and skin. In Bangladesh, most of the recognized stages of arsenic
   poisoning have been identified. The risk of arsenic poisoning in
   Bangladesh is increasing. The number of patients seriously affected by
   arsenic in drinking water has now risen to 7000 demanding extensive
   research in this held.
   This note addresses tubewell contamination in groundwater and
   health-related impacts. A previous study made by the author presents the
   subsurface occurrence of arsenic :Ind the reason of contamination. The
   latest statistics available an the arsenic contamination in groundwater
   indicate that 52 districts around 80\% of the total area of Bangladesh
   and estimate that around 40 million people ore at risk. Patients with
   melanosis. leuco-melanosis, keratosis, hyperkeratosis, dorsum.
   non-petting oedema. gangrene and skin cancer have been identified. Among
   the affected people, the most common presentations are melanosis
   (93.5\%), keratosis (68.3\%), hyperkeratosis (37.6\%) and dipigmentation
   (leuco-melanosis) (39.1\%). Cancers were found among 0.8\% and actinic
   keratitis and Bowen's disease are identified among 3.1\% cases.
   According to available data the Dhaka Community Hospital (DCH)
   identified 1903 patients with arsenical skin manifestations, the
   National Institute for Preventive and Social Medicine (NIPSOM) listed
   800 arenicosis patients and the institute for Post-Graduate Medical
   Research (IPGMR) investigated 250 arsenical skin lessions patients. (C)

Abstract = {{The performance and composition of the microbial community have been
   examined in a nitrifying fluidized-bed biofilm reactor for wastewater
   treatment arranged as the ultimate treatment step subsequent to BOD- and
   biological P-elimination. The microbial composition was analyzed by
   means of rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes. An NH4+-N elimination of
   more than 95\% at influent concentrations of up to 80 mg NH4+-N l(-1)
   was observed during a period with 75\% carrier material (v/v) and a
   hydraulic retention time of 1.8 h. Using a confocal laser scanning
   microscope it was found that the biofilm structure on the carrier
   material (tubes of 5 mm length) was mainly influenced by the loss
   processes affecting the biofilm. The microbial composition, using
   fluorescent in situ hybridization, was dominated by the beta-group of
   the Proteobacteria (up to 55\% of the DAPI cell number). The
   ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, a subgroup of the beta-Proteobacteria, were
   characterized by their occurrence in clusters. Using different probes
   for ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, a shift in the population structure
   within the experimental period was observed. Nitrobacter could not be
   detected with probes such as NIT1, NIT2 and NIT3. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{2,4,6-Triphenylpyrylium ion (TP+) encapsulated inside the supercages of
   Y zeolite (TPY) can efficiently effect the photocatalytic degradation of
   methyl parathion in aqueous solutions. Comparison of the performance of
   TPY with that of TP+ deposited on amorphous silica has shown that the
   zeolite host contributes to the efficiency of the system by stabilizing
   TP+ avoiding its nucleophilic ring opening and by absorbing the organic
   pollutant from the aqueous phase and concentrating it in the interior of
   the solid. Although TPY does not undergo irreversible bleaching after
   three consecutive irradiations, its activity is largely reduced probably
   due to blockage of the zeolite micropores by adventitious reagents and
   products. Up to 75\% of the original activity can be regained by simple
   solid-liquid extraction. Concerning the mechanism of the
   photodegradation, it has been ruled out the intermediacy of singlet
   oxygen as well as a direct photoinduced electron transfer between
   excited TP+ and methyl parathion. instead, evidence has been presented
   for the need of O-2 as Coreagent as well as the involvement of radicals.

Abstract = {{Seven azo dyes were photocatalytically degraded in TiO2 suspension.
   Their degradation rates were compared with disappearance and TOC

   approximate agreement with that of ozonation rates cited from
   literature. Major intermediates identified are aromatic amine, phenolic
   compounds and several organic acids. It was indicated from this study
   that in the photocatalytic degradation of azo dye the disappearance
   proceeds through both oxidation and reduction, whereas TOC is eliminated

Abstract = {{The effects of marine aquaculture on the environment were evaluated by
   studying the water quality of San Pedro river, a canal located within
   the Bay of Cadiz (SW of Spain). Marine aquaculture, both extensive and
   intensive, is one of the most important activities carried out in this
   area. Several facilities are located on this river, the most important
   being devoted to the intensive culture of Gilthead Seabream (Sparus
   aurata). The characterization of the water consisted of the evaluation
   of the variation of several parameters along the river and during
   different seasons. These parameters were pH, temperature. salinity,
   dissolved oxygen, suspended solids and nutrients (ammonium, nitrite,
   nitrate and phosphate). With a water quality criteria based on local
   laws, a significant but not dangerous pollution was observed in the
   area. with ammonium and suspended solids being the most significant
   pollutants. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial adsorption of 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
   (1,2,3,4-TCDD) and various polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) was
   investigated in an effort to determine the significance of
   microorganisms as potential agents in transferring the molecules in the
   environment. The microorganisms used in this study were cultivated under
   low nutrient conditions for 2 months. The increase and decrease of
   1,2,3,4-TCDD and PCDFs in the samples were measured by GC/MS. The peak
   of dibenzofuran (DBF), added as an internal standard, was compared with
   the peaks of 1,2,3,4-TCDD and PCDFs. The results showed that the dead
   biomass of microorganisms could remove these molecules from the medium
   more effectively than live cells. The subsequent studies suggested that
   the removal of the molecules be concerned with the unknown
   biocompound(s) of which secretion is pronounced at high temperature.
   UV-VIS spectrometry was used to monitor the change in the concentration
   of biocompound(s). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This note outlines an analysis of the centrate viscosity in response to
   polymer conditioning of an alum sludge. Recognising the complexity of
   the controls on viscosity, an analytical scheme is described in which
   the centrate viscosity (at low contaminant concentrations) can be
   regarded as the linear sum of component terms. As the polymer dose is
   increased from zero, the centrate viscosity decreases initially, passes
   through a minimum and then increases. The interaction of viscosity
   contributions arising from the turbidity and residual polymer in the
   centrate appear to control the polymer dosage at which the minimum
   occurs, whereas the solvent viscosity, together with an electrolytic
   component contribute towards the overall viscosity. Associated analysis
   indicates that the minimum in the viscosity-dose trend coincides with
   the onset of adsorption saturation of a nonionic polymer. (C) 1999
