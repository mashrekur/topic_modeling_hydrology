Abstract = {{Several results have been obtained for biofilm under inhibitive
   substrate. The first result gives the conditions that the existence of
   protective effect in biofilm depends on the bulk liquid substrate
   concentration. The second adds one boundary condition to obtain a
   biofilm thickness such that the whole range of biofilm has higher
   substrate consumption rates than the rate in the bulk liquid. The third
   shows the maximum range of two intervals for both substrate
   concentration at the wall and biofilm thickness, and equations for two
   conservative biofilm thicknesses that may be useful for practical
   applications. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Daily water temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles in 3002 Minnesota
   lakes have been simulated by deterministic process-based water quality
   models with daily meteorological conditions from 1955 to 1979 as input.
   From the simulated results, indicators of lake water quality and fish
   habitat characteristics have been extracted and correlated selectively
   with normal air temperature, lake mean depth, wind-related densimetric
   Froude number and Lake number. A seasonal maximum Lake number was found
   to be a good predictor for volume averaged water temperatures, maximum
   water temperatures near lake bottom, seasonal stratification
   characteristics, volume averaged dissolved oxygen concentrations, anoxia
   characteristics and fish good-growth habitat. Lakes with a maximum daily
   Lake number bigger than 1.0, are seasonally stratified, have low
   hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentration, and only a fraction of lake
   depth available for good-growth of fish. Lakes with maximum daily Lake
   number less than 1.0 are polymictic, with high dissolved oxygen
   concentration, and with maximum depth available for good fish growth.
   Empirical formulas for lake water quality and stratification indicators
   derived from the simulation results give good predictions of temperature
   and dissolved oxygen characteristics estimated from measurements in
   seven Minnesota lakes. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Adsorption equilibria are evaluated for Cd(II), Pb(II) and Zn(II) on a
   sample of pass 200 mesh Lithuanian glauconite using two different
   experimental/analytical approaches. First, the impacts of total metal
   concentration, ionic strength and pH on adsorption capacity are
   quantified in terms of the Freundlich isotherm equation for isotherms
   conducted at a single initial pH value. Relative adsorption capacity for
   the metals was in the order Pb > Cd > Zn. Secondly, pH effects and
   sorption mechanisms were examined more closely using the triple
   layer-surface complexation model to describe pH-adsorption edges.
   Although glauconite is a complex clay mineral,a single site approach
   provided a satisfactory description for many of the cases studied.
   Discrepancies between model simulations and experimental data were
   observed for some instances involving large changes in ionic strength or
   sorbate-to sorbent ratio when using adsorption reactions and equilibrium
   constants evaluated for a baseline case. Analysis of the possible
   contributions of multi-site adsorption, cationic exchange, mineral
   dissolution and desorption phenomena are required to more accurately
   characterize metal uptake by glauconite. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The sterol content of faeces from humans and 14 species of animals
   common to rural or urban environments were examined. The major human
   faecal sterol was the 5 beta-stanol, coprostanol which constituted
   approximate to 60\% of the total sterols found in human faeces. The
   sterol profiles of herbivores were dominated by C-29 sterols and 5
   beta-stanols were generally in equal or greater abundance than 5
   alpha-stanols. The principal faecal biomarker of herbivores was
   24-ethylcoprostanol. The sterol content of bird faeces was extremely
   variable and largely dependent on the animals diet. Both 5 beta and 5
   alpha stanols were in very low abundance in birds and dogs faeces from
   this study presumably due to the absence or low activity of the
   necessary anaerobic biota required to reduce Delta(5)- or
   Delta(5,22)-sterols to stanols. Cats and pigs were the only animals that
   had similar faecal sterol profiles to humans. However, the concentration
   of the principal human biomarker coprostanol was some 10 times more
   abundant on a dry weight basis in the faeces of humans than in those of
   cats and pigs. The source specificity of faecal sterol biomarkers is a
   combination of sterol intake, metabolic production of sterols and the
   biota resident within the animal's digestive tract. The `'sterol
   fingerprints'' of the faeces of humans and animals are sufficiently
   distinctive to be of diagnostic value in determining whether faecal
   pollution in water samples are of human or animal origin. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The adsorption/desorption of pentachlorophenol (PCP) with Calgon F300
   granular activated carbon (GAG) was studied and modelled. A modified
   Radke-Prausnitz (1972) isotherm model, incorporating a temperature- and
   pH-dependent proportionality constant, was found to best describe the
   observed PCP adsorption and desorption. The modified isotherm is valid
   in the ranges 4 less than or equal to pH less than or equal to 11 and 10
   less than or equal to T less than or equal to 60 degrees C. The
   activation energy of PCP adsorption was calculated to be 5.2 kJ/mol. At
   30 degrees C, PCP adsorbed strongly, and the rate of subsequent
   desorption was very low. However, the amount of PCP desorbed could be
   increased significantly by increasing the temperature to 60 degrees C.

Abstract = {{Khirbet As-Samra (KA) treated wastewater is being used in irrigation in
   the Central Jordan Valley. The treated water is collected in King Talal
   Dam (KTD) and then mixed with King Abdullah Canal (KAC) water, which is
   diverted from the Yarmouk River for further use in agriculture. The
   treated water has adversely affected the water quality of Yarmouk River.
   Comparison of the results of water quality tests with guidelines for
   water to be used for irrigation, salt tolerance of agricultural crops
   and the influence of water quality on the potential clogging of drip
   irrigation systems reveals that treated effluent from KA can be used for
   irrigation with restrictions. Moreover, concentrations of all trace
   elements were found to be low and within guidelines for irrigation
   water. Clogging of drip emitters is expected due to high calcium and
   magnesium contents, besides the high bacterial counts and nutrients that
   promote algal growth. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{A case study of the examination of the changes of organic matter in a

   from baker's yeast and pharmaceutical industries. The stream was
   characterized by a COD of several thousands of mg O-2 l(-1), most of
   which was biodegradable organic matter. Biodegradation processes took
   place in the surface water, with consequent oxygen depletion in the
   stream. The organic matter content of the river sediment was more than
   10\% of its dry weight. Bank filtration of organic substances was
   investigated in a number of observation wells at distances of 5-150 m
   from the river (under different hydrological conditions). The
   infiltration of organic matter from the polluted stream into the aquifer
   was found to be significant only at hydrological conditions where the
   water level exceeds the altitude of the stream bed. The organic matter
   present in groundwater samples was mainly a humic/fulvic type, and was
   not degraded during the 64 days of the laboratory biodegradation
   experiment. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{A risk assessment approach was used to estimate the public health

   significant economic impact on society in terms of direct medical costs,
   loss of work, quality of life and mortality. The virus is common in
   domestic wastewater and polluted surface waters. Dose-response data in
   human adult volunteers indicate that it is the most infective of all the
   enteric viruses, and this was used to develop a microbial risk
   assessment model to estimate daily and yearly risks of infection,
   morbidity and mortality for exposure via drinking and recreational
   waters using existing information on the occurrence of rotavirus. The
   disease is most severe for the very young, the elderly, and the
   immunocompromised. Case fatality rates in the United States are 0.01\%
   in the general population, 1\% in the elderly, and up to 50\% in the
   immunocompromised. Analysis indicates that significant risks of disease
   (5 x 10(-1)-2.45 x 10(-3)) could result for drinking and recreational
   waters in which rotavirus has been detected. The major limitation in
   assessing the risks of waterborne rotaviral infections at present is the
   lack of data on its occurrence in water and the potential for human
   exposure. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Much of the methodology employed for characterizing wastewater and in
   modeling wastewater treatment processes employs off-line analysis.
   Off-line analysis is time consuming and not ideally suited to developing
   process control strategies. Clearly a rapid, inexpensive and reliable
   method suitable for following organic consumption and biomass production
   on-line would be very useful. In this study multiple excitation-multiple
   emission fluorometry was examined as a method for monitoring wastewater
   treatment processes. Results were first obtained for defined protein
   solutions and activated sludge to identify characteristic excitation and
   emission wavelength pairs. These results were then used to develop a
   rapid off-line assay for measurement of synthetic feeds consisting of
   protein substrates for batch aerobic and anoxic wastewater treatment
   processes and for on-line monitoring of cellular metabolic states in an
   anoxic process. Step-wise multiple regression and principal component
   analysis were employed for data analysis. The former was used to
   determine the most informative excitation and emission wavelength pairs
   while the latter was applied to reduce fluorescent spectra dimensions.
   Analysis of the batch kinetics suggests that this approach is valid and
   revealed some dynamic features of protein utilization and biomass
   accumulation under aerobic and anoxic conditions. A correlation was
   developed between COD-removal rates and the fluorescence signals in the
   two processes using fluorescent emission spectra rather than single
   signals. The data suggests that this multiple excitation-multiple
   emission fluorometry may be a suitable method for following wastewater
   and activated sludge dynamics and could be used as the basis for the
   development of expert system based biosensors. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{1-Amino-8-naphthol-3,6-disulfonic acid (H-acid) is widely used in
   chemical industries for synthesis of direct, acid, reactive and azoic
   dye. The wastewater from H-acid manufacturing process is rich in various
   substituted derivatives of naphthalene and is one of the most
   hardly-treated wastewaters. A pretreatment method, ferrous ion-peroxide
   oxidation combined with coagulation, has been studied. The results have
   shown that the optimum pH value is below 4 and the suitable ferrous ion
   dosage is 200 mg/l. The COD removal of H-acid wastewater is about 50\%
   and the residue have proved biodegradable when hydrogen peroxide dosage
   is 30 g/l. Ferrous ion-peroxide oxidation process can also improve
   efficiency of coagulation treatment. The overall COD removal can reach
   90\% or more when the concentration of ferrous ion is 200 mg/l, the
   dosage of hydrogen peroxide is 3 g/l and the ferric chloride dosage of
   two stage coagulation treatment is 15 g/l and 5 g/l, respectively. The
   groups on naphthalene ring, such as - + NO2, SO3- etc., are substituted
   by hydroxyl free radical, and then the ring is broken down during
   oxidation process of H-acid. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{The kinetic behaviors of simultaneous phosphorus release and
   denitrification on sludge were investigated under anoxic condition. A
   phosphorus enriched sludge produced from Anaerobic-Anoxic-Oxic (AnAO)
   process under various SRT (5, 10 and 15 days) operation conditions was
   carried out in a series of batch tests. Experimental results indicated
   that the available organic substrate determined the kinetic behaviors of
   phosphorus release/uptake and denitrification. The simultaneous
   phosphorus release and denitrification demonstrated a kinetic
   competition under anoxic conditions in the presence of an available
   organic substrate. When the substrate was abundant, sludge was under
   `'releasable-phosphorus-limited'' condition; phosphorus release rate
   decreased slightly by nitrate inhibition. However, nitrate significantly
   inhibited phosphorus release when sludge was under
   `'initial-substrate-limited'' condition. Moreover, the sludge's
   phosphorus contents (as created by different SRT processes) dominated
   the kinetics of competition between phosphorus release and
   denitrification. The sludge with a high phosphorus content had a higher
   phosphorus release rate in accordance with a lower denitrification rate.
   Additionally, the substrate sequestrated rate markedly increased under
   the condition of simultaneous phosphorus release and denitrification.
   Finally, a preliminary metabolism model of denitrifying phosphorus
   removal bacteria was proposed, and found to be capable of adequately
   accounting for simultaneous phosphorus release and denitrification under
   anoxic conditions. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{In degradation studies of xenobiotics in groundwater environments from
   where only water samples can be obtained (e.g. established deep
   groundwater wells, inhomogeneous formations as boulder aquifers, or
   consolidated aquifers), solids might be added as biomass support
   materials. The importance of biomass support materials as quartz sand,
   rock wool and crushed tiles on the degradation of 8 aromatic
   hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, o-xylene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene (1,2-DCB),
   1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB), naphthalene, biphenyl and nitrobenzene)
   was investigated in experiments with groundwater collected from two
   aerobic aquifers (Vejen and Grindsted, Denmark). Experiments with only
   groundwater as well as groundwater suspensions with aquifer sediment
   were run as references. It was impossible to adjust pH to the desired
   level in the experiments with crushed tiles, where also substantial
   sorption of the test compounds and server clogging of filters used in
   sampling occurred, and this material was therefore useless as biomass
   support material. Presence of rock wool supported growth of bacteria and
   increased the degradation (in terms of rates and number of compounds
   degraded) compared with experiments with groundwater only. However, the
   degradation was less and the degradation patterns varied more than in
   the presence of aquifer sediment. Quartz sand gave the most promising
   results with respect to growth of bacteria, and the degradation patterns
   of most of the compounds were similar to those obtained in experiments
   including aquifer sediments, although the latter showed the most
   substantial degradation. This study suggests that in case aquifer
   sediment is not available, quartz sand should be added as biomass
   support material in studies on degradation of organic xenobiotics in
   groundwater environments. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{For treatment of wastewater with immobilized cells, support materials
   need to meet the following criteria: insoluble, not biodegradable, high
   mechanical stability, high diffusivity, simple immobilization procedure,
   high biomass retention, minimal attachment of other organisms and
   preferably a low cost price. In order to compare which support materials
   are the most suitable, characteristics of several natural and synthetic
   materials have been determined. For this, both literature and
   experimental data were used. The immobilization procedures of natural
   gel materials, like alginate and carrageenan, are mild and cells grow
   well in these supports. Furthermore, the effective diffusion
   coefficients of substrates are close to those in water. These supports,
   however, appeared to be soluble, biodegradable and liable to abrasion.
   Synthetic gels, on the contrary, have better mechanical properties, but
   mostly lower substrate diffusion coefficients. Immobilization conditions
   are less mild resulting in low biomass retention. For application of
   entrapped nitrifying cells in wastewater-treatment systems synthetic
   gels, however, are promising. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Coprostanol is a faecal sterol that has been proposed as an alternative
   measure of faecal pollution. While the technique has been used
   successfully to trace sewage-derived organic matter in a range of
   environments, it has not been embraced for use as a water quality
   indicator. This is mostly because of a lack of epidemiological evidence
   relating coprostanol abundance to any health risk. However, there is a
   valuable reason why the concentration of coprostanol should be related
   as quantitatively as possible to the abundance of bacterial indicators
   currently used to measure faecal pollution. The measurement of
   coprostanol (and concurrently other faecal sterols) offers many
   diagnostic and quantitative advantages over traditional techniques for
   detecting human sewage pollution versus faecal contamination from animal
   sources. Knowing the amount of coprostanol expected given a certain
   amount of human sewage pollution would provide a measure against which
   water managers could quantitatively assess faecal pollution as a whole
   and relate that assessment to variables with which they are more
   familiar. This study determines the relationships between coprostanol
   concentrations and indicator bacterial counts and synthesises the
   results from several environments to propose coprostanol concentrations
   broadly equivalent to existing bacterial standards. Our data suggest
   that 60 and 400 ng L(-1) of coprostanol correspond to currently defined
   primary and secondary contact limits for bacteria measured as
   thermotolerant coliforms (commonly referred to as faecal coliforms) or
   enterococci. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The bacterial populations, their roles and distribution in an anaerobic
   filter treating a simulated pharmaceutical effluent containing a
   branched-chain fatty acid (BCFA) were studied. The BCFA degradation
   pathway and mechanisms were also investigated. The biofilm from the
   filter was enriched in serum bottle cultures using different BCFAs and
   fatty acids as the sole carbon source. The anaerobic biofilm was a
   consortium of (1) BCFA-degrading Syntrophomonas spp, which produced
   ethanoic acid and H-2, (2) H-2-utilizing Methanococcus spp, and (3)
   ethanoate-utilizing Methanothrix spp. Beta-oxidation was proposed as the
   acidogenic mechanism. The bacterial consortium could degrade BCFAs with
   tertiary carbon but not those with quaternary carbon. Branching at the
   alpha or beta position along the carbon chain interfered with the
   beta-oxidation mechanisms. Bacterial distribution in the filter was
   uneven, which was attributed to incomplete mixing. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{Macroinvertebrates were collected over 4 years by standard sampling
   procedures used within the UK Environment Agency (EA). Contemporary
   environmental data were used to ``explain{''} biological variation using
   multivariate techniques provided by the program CANOCO. Variations in
   macroinvertebrate taxa composition, Biological Monitoring Working Party
   (BMWP) score and average score per taxon (ASPT) primarily reflected
   changes in habitat across the Mole catchment. When the analysis was
   restricted to sites overlying the dominant geological stratum (Weald
   clay) the principal variation in taxa composition, BMWP score and ASPT
   was most correlated with variation in water quality. Significant
   correlations between the presence of certain taxa and measurements of
   dissolved oxygen (DO) provided support for the relative scores
   attributed to these taxa by the BMWP. The month in which a
   macroinvertebrate sample was collected was relatively unimportant as an
   influence on taxa composition. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments have been conducted to characterize the
   sensitivity of a pure-cultured denitrifying bacterium from wastewater
   sludge, selected by virtue of its exhibiting promising qualities as a
   biomarker, to wastewater process variables and potential toxic
   inhibition by a heavy metal, cadmium. A pure culture method offers the
   possibility of development of a standardized toxicity test with
   reproducible results that are not site specific, and enables close
   examination of one specific reaction without interference from other
   organisms in the system. Denitrification by the selected bacterium,
   measured in terms of nitrite reduction, is rapid, reproducible, and
   conforms to a linear time-concentration profile, Provided a select range
   of process conditions is employed. The denitrification rate is a maximum
   at about 30 degrees C and in a pH range of 7.5 to 8.0. The rate per unit
   wet mass of cells is constant for varying cell concentrations and given
   conditions of pH and temperature. A noncompetitive inhibition model
   provided a good description of the relationship between denitrification
   rate and the concentration of a heavy metal, cadmium. The model
   constant, K-i, the concentration resulting in 50\% inhibition, is 12
   mg/l for cadmium for the test conditions used and represents a means for
   assessing the relative toxicity of inhibitors. The reproducibility of
   the test cases studied and straightforward analysis render the bacterium
   and test procedures promising for development of a rapid toxicity test
   for wastewater in a denitrifying environment. Ongoing studies are
   directed toward evaluating the extent to which the test organism
   represents the response of a denitrifying sludge population to
   potentially toxic compounds. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{The ability of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) from landfill leachate
   polluted groundwater to form complexes with the heavy metals cadmium
   (Cd), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn) was investigated. The DOC samples
   originated from the leachate pollution plume at Vejen Landfill, Denmark
   and were studied in the original matrix with a minimum of manipulation.
   The experiments were performed as batch sorption experiments and the
   metal distribution between the aquifer material and the solution (K-d)
   was determined in the leachate polluted groundwater samples and in
   reference solutions of synthetic inorganic leachate. The difference in
   distribution coefficients was a direct indication of complex formation
   between DOC and heavy metals. The results showed, that DOC from landfill
   leachate polluted groundwater has the ability to form complexes with Cd,
   Ni and Zn, and the distribution coefficients were a factor of 2-6 lower
   in the presence of DOG. Based on the distribution coefficients, the
   relative migration velocities of the heavy metals were estimated. The
   migration velocity of the metals was increased by the presence of DOC
   but did not exceed 1.2\% of the water migration velocity, indicating
   that the effect of DOC on the mobility of Cd, Ni and Zn may have only
   minor environmental importance. Conditional complex formation constants
   (log K,) were estimated from the K-d-values. The constants for 1:1
   complexes increased slightly in the following order Zn < Cd < Ni.
   However, increasing the metal concentration into the mg l(-1) level
   decreased the constants by about one order of magnitude, showing the
   importance of determining the constants at environmentally relevant
   metal concentrations. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Single and competitive adsorption of cadmium and zinc onto granular
   activated carbon DARCO 12-20 mesh has been investigated. This activated
   carbon has been shown as an effective adsorbent for both metals. Cadmium
   and zinc removals increased with pH and decreased with molar
   metal/carbon ratio. Surface precipitation phenomena have been detected
   for the higher pHs and molar ratios. The adsorption process has been
   modelled on the surface complexation Triple Layer Model (TLM). For this
   purpose, the amphoteric nature of the activated carbon has been studied.
   Single metal adsorption data have been used to calibrate TLM parameters.
   A dependence of the adsorption constants on pH and molar metal/carbon
   ratio has been observed, and a correlation for log K-ads has been
   determined. In the competitive system, the removal efficiency of the
   activated carbon decreased for both metals. The TLM model, using surface

   successfully predicted cadmium and zinc removal from the two metal

Title = {{Mixing in upflow anaerobic filters and its influence on performance and

Abstract = {{Tracer studies were carried out in laboratory-scale and pilot-scale
   upflow anaerobic filters to determine the effect of liquid velocity, gas
   production and media depth on mixing patterns. A computer simulation
   model was developed to analyse tracer-response curves. In water studies
   at laboratory scale, gas production was shown to have a significantly
   greater effect on mixing than liquid upflow velocity. A reduction in the
   quantity of media also resulted in greater mixing due to the greater
   void space in which synthetic gas bubbles could cause turbulence. In the
   presence of sludge during reactor operation, at pilot and
   laboratory-scale, gas production had a significant influence on mixing.
   However, liquid velocity played an important role in solids distribution
   in the filter, in conjunction with media depth. At pilot-scale, at a low
   solids concentration, a high liquid velocity lifted the sludge `'bed'',
   raising the source of gas production. The absence of gas below the
   sludge bed resulted in a plug flow regime which the incoming substrate
   entered. A reduction in the quantity of media increased the degree of
   mixing for a given liquid velocity and gas surface load. Lower liquid
   upflow velocities are required at a reduced media depth to prevent
   excessive biomass loss. Shear rates increase at high liquid and gas
   velocities, resulting in detachment of solids from the media, and
   biomass washout. A close correlation was established between mixing and
   process performance which led to the development of a programme for
   start-up and operation of the filter to maintain optimum
   biomass/substrate contact. A strategy for scale-up was proposed through
   the development of correlations obtained from laboratory-scale filter
   studies which were used to predict pilot-scale mixing characteristics.
   This research highlighted the important factors influencing mixing
   patterns and scale-up in anaerobic upflow filters. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{The paper deals with the air composition in pressure saturators used for
   dissolved air flotation. Two mathematical models are developed: a
   kinetic model for describing the change in saturator air composition
   with time from start-up to eventual equilibrium, and an abbreviated
   model for only predicting the saturator air composition once equilibrium
   is reached. Both derivations are based on mole balances for the two
   major components of atmospheric air, nitrogen and oxygen, and the
   equilibrium between saturator air and outflowing water as predicted by
   Henry's law. The models take factors into account which had hitherto
   been ignored, such as saturator efficiency, saturator pressure and the
   oxygen saturation level in the incoming water. The kinetic model gives a
   clear demonstration of the changes in air composition after saturator
   start-up and how different operating parameters affect the rate of
   change. It is demonstrated that laboratory saturators, operated at low
   hydraulic loading, could take many hours to attain equilibrium, which
   could explain anomalous measurements reported in the literature. Both
   mathematical models were tested with data collected from a laboratory
   saturator operated under conditions similar to those encountered at
   full-scale. The experimentally determined values agree well with the
   predicted results, with the exception that the actual saturator air
   composition converges towards an equilibrium concentration which is
   slightly less enriched in nitrogen than predicted by the theoretical
   models. Copyright (C) 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{A new early warding system for monitoring the quality of water was
   developed using the information conveyed by the continuous electric
   organ discharges of the tropical fish Apteronotus albifrons
   (Gymnotiformes, family Apteronotidae). The principle is based on the
   time characterisation of the electric signal emitted by the fish and
   uses the fact that the frequency and the form of the signal vary as a
   function of the physico-chemical quality of the ambient water. Eight
   test fish were individually confined in a heat-proof test chamber in
   which a continuous water current, thermo-regulated at 27 degrees C, was
   maintained. The electric signal sampled over 1 a periods were amplified.
   The computer processed the signals and their frequencies and determined
   the coordinates of the points where the temperatures were recorded. The
   results of the A. albifrons electrical activity were then visualised on
   a visual display unit. Subsequent mathematical processing helped to
   detect unusual electrical behaviour (crossing of lower and upper
   bounds). To illustrate the principle of this new early warning system,
   the electric response of the A. albifrons exposed to cyanide was tested
   and compared with the detection thresholds of other biological early
   warning systems. A. albifrons is able to detect a cyanide concentration
   of 34.6 mu g l(-1) in less than half an hour. The recorded results
   suggest that this new biomonitor corresponds very well with the
   requirements of warning stations for surface waters subject to cyanide
   pollution. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Cometabolic transformation of commercial linear alkylbenzenesulphonates
   (LAS) and pure congeners of 2-{[}4-(sulphophenyl)]nonan (2C(9)LAS) and
   2-{[}4-(sulphophenyl)]decan (2C(10)LAS) was studied by using a mixed
   methanotrophic-heterotrophic culture MM1 and a pure culture of type II
   methanotroph (strain CSC1), isolated from culture MM1. Cultures were
   grown in shake flasks under conditions promoting expression of the
   soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO). Both the mixed culture MM1 and the
   pure culture CSC1 were capable of transforming LAS with or without
   methane as the natural substrate. Experiments performed without methane
   (resting cells) showed faster cometabolic transformation of LAS
   congeners with longer alkyl side-chains. Both 2C(9)LAS and 2C(10)LAS
   congeners were transformed significantly faster at 30 degrees C,
   although the optimum temperature for the growth of mixed culture MM1 was
   20 degrees C. Simultaneous methane oxidation and LAS transformation, and
   their mutual competitive inhibition, indicated the involvement of the
   MMO enzyme system and possible methanotrophic activity in the initiation
   of cometabolic LAS transformation. The capability of two heterotrophic
   species to transform sulphophenyldecanoic acid suggests possible
   heterotrophic activity in further LAS transformation CII-oxidation).
   Faster LAS transformation by mixed culture MM1 than by pure culture CSC1
   suggested that methanotrophic-hetero trophic interactions are important
   for transformation of the complex LAS molecule. Copyright (C) 1996

Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3099-3105}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Determination of anaerobic degradation rates and toxic effects of
   nitrobenzene (NB) on acetate utilizing methanogens was the first
   objective of this research. Serum bottles were used for anaerobic
   toxicity assays with an acetate enrichment culture of methanogens. Ten
   mg/l of nitrobenzene did not inhibit total gas production in the acetate
   enrichment methanogenic culture. Twenty and thirty mg/l of nitrobenzene
   caused reversible inhibition of methanogenesis. Batch kinetic
   experiments showed that 20 mg/l of nitrobenzene was degraded with a
   first-order rate constant, k, of 0.37 d(-1). Acetate was not degraded
   during the first 7 days when the measured nitrobenzene concentration was
   higher than about 1 mg/l. The second objective was to determine the
   effect of zinc on nitrobenzene degradation in methanogenic systems. Ten
   mg/l of spiked zinc caused a reduction of gas production in the systems
   with 10 mg/l of nitrobenzene; 20 mg/l of zinc led to failures of systems
   with 10 and 20 mg/l of nitrobenzene. With 10 and 20 mg/l of added zinc,
   the k value for nitrobenzene degradation decreased to 0.18 d(-1) and
   0.14 d(-1), respectively. With 20 mg/l of Zn, acetate was not degraded
   at all even after nitrobenzene concentration reached 0.1 mg/l,
   indicating toxicity of Zn to methanogenesis. Abiotic control tests with
   autoclaved culture showed that adsorption alone could remove 60-70\% of
   spiked nitrobenzene in 36 days. However, the samples extracted from
   solids in the methanogenic test systems showed that nitrobenzene was
   below the detection limit of 0.1 mg/l, indicating biodegradation of
   nitrobenzene in these systems. Traces of benzene were seen as an
   intermediate in the liquid samples. Headspace analysis showed that
   nitrobenzene and benzene were below detection limits. Copyright (C) 1996

   estimation of activated sludge states and parameters from noisy process
   measurements (Kabouris and Georgakakos, 1996a, Wat. Res., 30, 2853-2865)
   is simplified, in terms of its memory storage and computational
   requirements, for efficient on-line implementation. This is achieved by
   processing only the four most recent sets of 5-min on-line measurements
   at each estimation instance, along with the utilization of simplified
   estimation equations for tracking state and parameter variations,
   following the initial convergence period. The algorithm is tested in a
   computational case study involving a nitrifying activated sludge
   process, modelled by the IAWQ Activated Sludge Model 1 and incorporating
   a dynamic settling and clarification model. The on-line LML algorithm is
   capable of tracking the process states and parameters under dynamic

Abstract = {{The sorption of chlorinated C-1- and C-2-hydrocarbons and monocyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons on sea sediment was studied with a miscible
   displacement technique. Detection was done either by on-line
   UV-detection or off-line GC-analysis. Equilibrium partitioning
   coefficients between the salt water phase and the marine sediment were
   determined for 11 compounds by fitting their breakthrough curves to a
   local sorption equilibrium model. Based on the obtained partitioning
   coefficients and on the measurement of the organic carbon content of the
   sediment, the sorption into the organic carbon fraction was considered.
   Log K-oc data (K-oc = organic carbon-water partitioning coefficient)
   were calculated. A linear relationship between the log K-oc values and
   the log K-ow data (K-ow = octanol-water partitioning coefficient) was
   found (r = 0.94, n = 11). However, the sorption was lower than expected
   from the log K-ow data. Finally, the implications of the experimental
   results for the sorption behaviour of the compounds in the marine
   environment were evaluated. It was concluded that the sea sediment does
   not act as an important sink for these anthropogenic compounds.

Title = {{Relationship between the concentration of denitrifiers and Pseudomonas

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3139-3145}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aquifer microcosms were used to investigate the effect of stimulating
   denitrification on microbial population shifts and BTX degradation
   potential. Selective pressure for facultative denitrifiers was applied
   to a treatment set by feeding acetate and nitrate, and cycling electron
   acceptor conditions twice between aerobic and denitrifying stages. A
   second (control) set degraded the same amount of acetate under aerobic
   conditions. The resulting concentrations of total heterotrophs were not
   significantly different between the two sets. Nevertheless, the
   concentrations of denitrifiers, Pseudomonas spp., and BTX degraders were
   significantly higher in the cycled microcosms than in the aerobic
   controls. The predominant isolates from the cycled microcosms were
   fluorescent Pseudomonas species that are known to degrade BTX. Following
   the complete removal of acetate, cycled microcosms also showed higher
   aerobic BTX degradation activity. These results suggest that nitrate
   addition to oxygen-limited aquifers might enhance BTX bioremediation not
   only by supplementing the electron acceptor pool as is widely accepted,
   but also by fostering favorable changes in the composition of the
   microbial consortium. Specifically, denitrifying conditions could have
   the ancillary benefit of fortuitously selecting for Pseudomonas spp,
   that can degrade BTX. This syllogism is supported by a survey of
   international soils (from France, Denmark, Brazil and Iowa, USA), which
   showed a correlation between the concentration of denitrifers and
   Pseudomonas spp. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{An experimental methodology was developed to measure haloform formation
   in chlorinated wastewater samples using a flexible bag, zero-head space,
   reactor. A flexible reactor vessel is advantageous when the reaction
   products are volatile since successive samples can be collected over
   time without creating a head-space and thereby eliminating partitioning
   of volatile reaction products from the aqueous phase to the gaseous
   phase. Grab samples of three kinds of wastewaters; raw wastewater,
   nitrified secondary effluent, and partially nitrified secondary
   effluent, were chlorinated at two levels of chlorine doses (Cl-2). The
   magnitude and rate of total trihalomethane (TTHM) production was
   estimated based on the formation of chloroform (CHCl3),
   bromodichloromethane (CHCl2Br), dibromochloromethane (CHClBr2) and
   bromoform (CHBr3). Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

   concentrate large volumes of environmental water for laboratory
   purposes. The portable virus concentrator consists of four parts: a
   sampling unit including a programmable peristaltic pump; a 5 mu m

   measure area. The ultrafiltration system includes 10(5) NMWL
   polysulfonate membranes, is performed at the natural pH of water and is
   followed by an elution step. By this technique, more than 60 1 are
   concentrated in an hour and the recovery of three types of concentrates
   is observed: parasites are retained in the prefiltrate; bacteria and
   80\% of viruses are recovered in the concentrates. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{Experiments on a semi-industrial scale on the removal of atrazine and
   simazine by nanofiltration have demonstrated the influence of natural
   organic matter (NOM) on the retention of these two s-triazines. In-depth
   studies at pilot scale, presenting the advantage of working on a larger
   range of NOM concentrations (or dissolved organic carbon: DOC), have
   given a better understanding of the principal phenomena involved in
   atrazine and simazine retention mechanisms in the presence or absence of
   NOM. When taken together, the results show that the principal transfer
   mechanism of the two s-triazines is probably through diffusion. However,
   their complexation with NOM leads, on the one hand, to an increase in
   their apparent molecular weight and, on the other, to the appearance of
   negative charges. As a result, electrostatic repulsion and adsorption
   are also phenomena to be considered. At pilot scale, atrazine and
   simazine removal by nanofiltration increases from 50\% to 90-100\% when
   the water's NOM content varies from 0.4 to 3.6 mg l(-1) of DOC.

Abstract = {{Two methods to unmix pollutant records obtained from sediment core data
   are investigated. A first-order method is expanded to include polynomial
   curve fitting to the original data. In addition, a new second-order
   method is developed; this method is based on the advection-diffusion
   equation for a tracer with constant mixing in a layer of thickness z(m)
   and no mixing below. The original data are fitted with a polynomial. The
   first-order method effectively unmixes lead and Cs-137 profiles in a
   core from northern Lake Michigan that was collected in 1984. Without
   unmixing, a 1969 maximum in the lead record would have been missed, and
   the 1963 Cs-137 maximum would have been underestimated, and incorrectly
   dated as 1956. Unmixing profiles of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs) in two cores collected from central and northern Lake Michigan in
   1988 produces more equivocal results, probably because of smaller z(m)
   values in these latter cores. The second-order method gives profiles of
   similar shapes as the first-order method, but the time scales are only
   identical for z(m) < 0.5-1.0 cm. For larger z(m), the first-order method
   gives extrema at more recent and correct times. Equivalent mixing
   parameters in the two methods are obtained by maintaining the Peclet
   number constant for conservative tracers. Errors in the reconstructed
   profiles are smaller for the first than for the second-order method,
   Accurate error estimates may be obtained by a Monte-Carlo method that
   takes into account the correlation between adjacent data points.

Abstract = {{Feasibility of methanolic waste treatment in an upflow anaerobic sludge
   blanket (UASB) reactor operating continuously for a period of more than
   400 days was examined. Optimum pH was found to be between 7.0-7.3. In
   this pH range, there was no excessive build-up of volatile fatty acids
   and no upset or reactor failure was observed. Elementary pathways of
   degradation of methanol to methane were shown to be governed by the
   operating pH. Permissible volumetric loading rate to achieve 80\% of TOC
   removal efficiency was determined to be 8 g-TOC/1 . d. Below this value,
   the effect of hydraulic retention time or loading rate on TOC removal
   efficiency was not pronounced. Kinetic coefficients of k, Ks, Y and b
   were determined to be 1.11g-TOC/g-VSS . d, 0.385g-TOC/1,
   0.213g-VSS/g-TOC and 0.005 d(-1), respectively. Maximum specific
   methanogenic activity was experimentally found to be 2 g-CH4-COD/g-VSS .
   d while maximum specific loading rate to achieve 80\% of TOC removal
   efficiency was determined to be 2 g-TOC/g-VSS . d. The results of this
   study suggest that single-step anaerobic treatment of methanolic waste
   is highly feasible provided that the PH is maintained close to 7.0.

Abstract = {{The decomposition of 2-chlorophenol in aqueous solution by UV/TiO2
   oxidation process was studied under various solution pH values, light
   intensities and types of TiO2. The removal of 2-chlorophenol and organic
   intermediates was found to be more effective for acidic solutions. The
   decomposition of 2-chlorophenol can be fitted well by a pseudo
   first-order kinetics. Experimental results indicated that the
   distribution of non-chlorinated and chlorinated intermediates on the
   photocatalytic decomposition rate of 2-chlorophenol were highly
   dependent on solution pH. At the same light intensity, the adequate
   dosage of TiO2 was found to be less for alkaline solutions than that for
   acidic solutions. Increasing the light intensity would significantly
   increase the decomposition rate of 2-chlorophenol at pH 3, but not at pH
   11. Both rutile and anatase forms of TiO2 were used in this study. The
   destruction rate of 2-chlorophenol of unit weight of rutile was less
   than that of anatase. However, the decomposition rates of 2-chlorophenol
   of unit surface area for both were almost the same in this research.
   Thus, the difference of the decomposition rates of 2-chlorophenol might
   be attributed to the difference of the surface area of various forms of
   TiO2, not to the difference of the crystal properties. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{This study assessed chemical effects and microbial response after
   Fenton's treatment of pendimethalin contaminated soils. The efficiency
   of the rapid chemical transformation of pendimethalin varied from 25\%
   to greater than 90\%. The highest efficiency was associated with a soil
   having comparatively low organic matter and low acid neutralizing
   capacity. This is consistent with the role of organic matter as a free
   radical scavenger and the optimum formation of free radicals at low pH.
   Potential heterotrophic activity, as measured by glucose mineralization,
   decreased with increasing pendimethalin concentration, but this
   inhibitory effect was removed after Fenton's treatment. Treatment also
   released BOD, COD, TOC, and nitrate into solution. The organic matter
   released into solution was biodegradable and served as a substrate for
   subsequent microbial growth. Analysis of the microbial population
   growing in the Fenton's treated soil leachates showed an overall
   decrease in (culturable) heterotrophic diversity, but an increase in the
   concentration of Pseudomonas species. These results suggest that
   Fenton's treatment of pendimethalin contaminated soil created favorable
   conditions for microorganisms desirable for bioremediation. Copyright

Abstract = {{Water quality of the river Sava nearby Ljubljana, Slovenia, was
   investigated. In that area, the river Sava receives two tributaries, the
   river Ljubljanica and the river Kamniska Bistrica, the former having
   highly decreasing impact on water quality of the river Sava. Discharge
   of organic, degradable wastewater into the river Ljubljanica and further
   into the river Sava results in a decrease of dissolved oxygen
   concentration. A surface water quality model, QUAL2E, developed by
   United States Environmental Protection Agency, was applied to estimate
   the impact of discharged wastewater on quality of the river Sava. QUAL2E
   model was modified and sensitivity analysis was performed to determine
   the most important factors which affect dissolved oxygen concentration
   in river water. The model was calibrated and validated according to the
   field measurements. On the basis of the model predictions it was
   estimated that in time when summer river low flow period occurs
   wastewater should be treated to reach BOD value under 30 mg l(-1) so
   that Slovenian water quality standards will not be violated (dissolved
   oxygen concentration higher than 5 mg l(-1) in all sections of the
   river). Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Selenium is a multiple oxidation state trace element whose redox
   chemistry and concentration in sea water can be modified by biological
   activity in the euphotic zone. A field study was undertaken to examine
   the effects of oceanographic and biological parameters on the selenium
   concentration of the coastal plankton. For this purpose, plankton was
   collected in the Ligurian Sea from October 1990 to December 1991. The
   samples analyzed were composed of mixed phytoplankton and
   microzooplankton ranging in size from 50 to 200 mu m. The medium
   selenium concentration measured in microplankton was 1.57 mu g Se .
   g(-1) carbon or 0.62 mu g Se g(-1) dry weight (n=15). Seasonal
   fluctuations in selenium concentration of microplankton were influenced
   by hydrodynamic conditions. During strong vertical mixing of the water
   column, deeper water with high selenite and selenate concentrations may
   reach the surface and selenium concentration in plankton was found to
   increase by a factor of eight compared to the median annual value. Under
   usual hydrodynamic conditions, seasonal fluctuations of the
   microplankton selenium content were typically low. Such low variations
   appeared to be due to the specific composition of microplankton. In the
   case of a phytoplankton bloom, selenium concentration in microplankton
   increased in proportion to the diatom biomass, whereas in other cases a
   negative linear relationship was found between selenium content and
   zooplankton biomass. The biogeochemical cycling of selenium may be
   influenced by seasonal fluctuations of the plankton selenium content
   which is controlled by hydrodynamic processes and plankton composition.

Abstract = {{The steady state analysis of coupling the function of aerator and

   using sludge recycle ratio and sludge waste ratio as the operating
   parameters, the responses of the output variables - biomass
   concentration in aerator, dissolved pollutant and solid concentration in
   effluent - are represented as response surfaces and isoresponse curves.
   Acceptable operating zone can be obtained from the curves and optimum
   parameters can be determined. Coupling the function of aerator and

Abstract = {{Iron oxides are good adsorbents for uncomplexed metals, some
   metal-ligand complexes, and many metal oxyanions. However, the adsorbent
   properties of these oxides are not fully exploited in wastewater
   treatment operations because of difficulties associated with their
   separation from the aqueous phase. This paper describes experiments in
   which iron oxides were coated onto the surface of ordinary filter sand,
   and this composite media was used in a fixed bed configuration for
   simultaneous filtration of particulate matter and sorption of dissolved
   metals. The process was successful in removing uncomplexed and
   ammonia-complexed cationic metals (Cu, Cd, Pb, Ni, Zn), as well as some
   oxyanionic metals (SeO3, AsO3), from simulated and actual waste streams
   over a wide range of metal concentrations. The adsorbent was stable
   during backwashing and regeneration operations, releasing most metals
   quantitatively; the exception was AsO3, which was not efficiently
   recovered by regeneration with either acid or base. The composite media
   is inexpensive to prepare and could serve as the basis of a useful metal
   removal and possibly metal recovery process in a variety of settings.

Abstract = {{This research examined the roles that algal populations, as sources of
   dissolved organic material (DOC), and water quality play in DOC removal
   during ozonation and coagulation processes. Algal monocultures were
   grown as suspensions in continuous-flow reactors to simulate bloom
   conditions and to provide a distinct type of DOC for treatment
   experiments. Jar tests were conducted with and without preozonation to
   assess DOC removal as a function of algal source, coagulant type and
   dose, pH and bicarbonate concentration. Overall, algal-derived DOC was
   difficult to remove; high coagulant doses were required and removal was
   strongly influenced by solution pH and algal source. Preozonation
   enhanced DOC removal to varying degrees depending on organic quality
   which was determined by the algal source. These results suggest that the
   unpredictable nature of ozone's ability to enhance coagulation in actual
   treatment practice may be related to changes in DOC caused by seasonal
   shifts in algal speciation and dominance. The technique of Pyrolysis
   (PY)-GC-MS was employed to explore the chemical basis for these
   differences in treatment performance. Preozonation produced dramatic
   changes in the chemical character of the organic matrix produced by
   algae as revealed by PY-GC-MS. These results suggest that, although use
   of ozone may not improve DOC removals in all cases, there may be
   advantages to ozone use which are related to desirable quality changes
   in the residual DOC. Furthermore, these results illustrate that PY-GC-MS
   is a powerful technique with which to characterize and monitor changes
   in organic quality so as to better understand chemical interactions in
   treatment. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Drainage water loss of dissolved phosphorus (DP) and particulate
   phosphorus (PP) from four artificially drained, loamy soil, arable
   catchments was studied over a 1-yr period comparing intensive (hourly
   samples pooled weekly) and discrete (weekly) sampling strategies. Annual
   total phosphorus (TP) loss determined by intensive sampling averaged
   0.241 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1), and was particularly high (0.627 kg P ha(-1)
   yr(-1)) at a catchment partly comprised of low-lying riparian areas used
   for grazing, where animal manure input was consequently high. At the
   other three catchments annual loss was lower (0.071-0.169 kg P ha(-1)
   yr(-1)). The major part of TP loss was accounted for by DP in the case
   of the catchment with the highest loss (71\%), but by PP at the other
   three catchments (55-71\%). Annual loss of PP ranged from 0.043-0.182 kg
   P ha(-1) yr(-1), being episodic and mainly occurring during storm
   events. Significant linear relationships were established between the
   concentrations of PP and particulate matter. Evidence was found
   indicating exhaustion of fine particulate matter availability during
   storm events, either in the soil macropores or in the drain pipe itself.
   As compared with intensive sampling, the discrete sampling strategy
   normally used for monitoring purposes underestimated P loss by more than
   50\% because most P loss occurred during storm events. It is therefore
   concluded that reliable estimates of P losses from artificially drained
   catchments can only be obtained using a sampling strategy that
   incorporates intensive sampling during storm events. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{Adsorption on a fixed bed of granulated adsorbent is an important method
   for water and wastewater treatment. Applied as one of the final stages
   in the treatment it reduces significantly the concentration of many
   pollutants. In view of such an application, a simplified method for
   determination of the break-through time of an adsorbent layer has been
   proposed. This time defines a protective action of a fixed bed before a
   pollutant of a concentration higher than 5\% of the initial value
   appears in the effluent. The method is based on the assumption of an
   external diffusional model of adsorption kinetics and a model of zone
   migration and classification of adsorbates in the liquid phase and in
   the adsorbing phase during adsorption from a binary solution. The method
   was verified experimentally in the system of GAC-aqueous one-component
   and binary solution of phenol, p-nitrophenol, benzoic acid and
   chlorophenols. For longer beds the prediction error of the break-through
   time did not exceed 10\%. The method enables a significant reduction or
   even elimination of troublesome experimental investigations of kinetic
   and dynamic aspects of fixed bed adsorption. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b was used in a sequencing biofilm reactor
   to degrade trichloroethylene (TCE) in water at approximately 100 mu g/l
   influent concentration. The reactor consisted of biofilms grown on
   diatomaceous earth pellets or glass beads, and was sequenced between
   growth cycle, in which methane and air were fed in a gas phase, and
   degradation cycle, in which the column was completely liquid-filled.
   Biomass loading on the support media was only 10 mg cell dry weight/g
   support media, giving a calculated biofilm thickness of 0.04 cm.
   Apparent pseudo-first order degradation rate constants in the system
   were improved by more than an order of magnitude, from 0.008 l/mg d to
   0.1 l/mg d, through the use of antibiotic-resistant strains of
   copper-resistant organisms that express only the soluble methane
   monooxygenase, the enzyme responsible for trichloroethylene degradation.
   Also, biomass accumulation was improved through the use of a cationic
   coagulating polymer. However, TCE degradation was sustained only for
   sort times, and cycling back to growth mode did not completely
   regenerate TCE degradation ability. Thus, biofilms of Methylosinus
   trichosporium OB3b did not give rise to sustained high degradation
   rates. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{The inactivation of enteric adenoviruses 40 and 41 by ultraviolet (UV)
   radiation was investigated and compared with poliovirus type 1 (strain
   LSc-2ab) and coliphages MS-2 and PRD-1. Purified stocks of the viruses
   were exposed to collimated ultraviolet radiation in a stirred reactor
   for a total dose of up to 140 mW s/cm(2). The doses of UV to achieve a
   90\% inactivation of adenovirus 40, adenovirus 41, coliphages MS-2 and
   PRD-1 and poliovirus type 1 were 30, 23.6, 14, 8.7 and 4.1 mW s/cm(2),
   respectively. Adenovirus 40 was significantly more resistant than
   coliphage MS-2 to UV irradiation (P < 0.01). Adenovirus 41 appeared
   slightly more sensitive than adenovirus 40, but the difference was not
   significant (P > 0.05). The resistance of PRD-1 was less than MS-2 (P <
   0.01), but greater than poliovirus type 1 (P < 0.01). Adenoviruses 40
   and 41 were more resistant than Bacillus subtilis spores, often
   suggested as an indicator of UV light performance. The double-stranded
   DNA adenoviruses appear-to be the most resistant of all potentially
   water-borne enteric viruses to UV light disinfection. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{The extent of reductive dechlorination occurring in contaminated,
   estuarine sediments was investigated. Contaminant and organic matter
   bioavailability and their effect on the reductive dechlorination of
   sediment-bound chlorobenzenes was the main focus of the work presented
   here. Sediment and water samples were collected from a contaminated
   estuarine system with more than 40 yr of contamination history.
   Hexachlorobenzene and other chlorinated benzene congeners were the
   predominant chlorinated compounds encountered. Anaerobic batch assays
   revealed that the sediment natural organic matter is recalcitrant and
   unable to support active microbial growth. However, sediment nutrients
   (e.g. N, P) were available in sufficient quantities to support an
   accelerated microbial growth. Static microcosms were constructed with
   sediment and water from the study site. The sediment microbial consortia
   were able to reductively dechlorinate the sediment-bound polychlorinated
   benzene congeners, primarily to dichlorobenzene isomers. The first-order
   rate constant for hexachlorobenzene depletion (k(obs)) ranged from 2.2 x
   10(-3) to 2.9 x 10(-3) d(-1), the higher value being achieved in
   microcosms supplemented with dextrin. These rates were about two orders
   of magnitude lower than those observed with the same sediment-derived,
   mixed dechlorinating microbial consortium in liquid cultures
   supplemented with freshly added hexachlorobenzene. The extent of
   hexachlorobenzene removal over a long incubation time (more than 480 d)
   was only 43\%, most of which occurred during the first 200 d of
   incubation. Both the recalcitrant nature of the sediment organic matter
   and the strong partitioning of the chlorinated compounds were
   responsible for the low rate and extent of contaminant transformation.
   When frequent additions of a degradable organic carbon source and ground
   sediment were used, an increased rate and extent of reductive
   dechlorination of the sediment-bound contaminants were observed (e.g.
   95\% hexachlorobenzene biotransformation within 205 d of incubation;
   k(obs) = 2.1 x 10(-2) d(-1)). Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Crucial and potentially rate limiting events in biofilm formation are
   the transport of microorganisms to the solid-water interface and the
   subsequent attachment onto a substratum. If these attached cells find
   suitable environmental conditions they will replicate, grow and form a
   biofilm. Experiments with different surfaces - stainless steel, glass,
   and polycarbonate - and two Pseudomonas species were conducted and
   parameters describing attachment, growth, and transport were measured in
   situ and in real time using image analysis techniques. The phenomenon of
   cellular starvation was investigated with special attention to the
   effect on the attachment characteristics of the two tested Pseudomonas
   species. Experiments were conducted with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
   Pseudomonas fluorescens as a Mot+ and a Mot- strain. As a result of
   superior transport properties, flagellated cells of Pseudomonas
   fluorescens colonized a substratum at a higher rate than unflagellated
   cells. Nutrient conditions in the bulk water influenced the growth of
   suspended and attached organisms, as well as the cellular transport to
   the solid-water interface and the rate of attachment onto the
   substratum. Starved cells of P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens exhibited
   increased cell motility by size reduction. Cellular transport was
   demonstrated to be a crucial process in microbial colonization, and may
   be limiting the overall rate of surface colonization. The phenomenon was
   demonstrated for a motile and nonmotile mutant of the same strain.
   Hence, diffusive, advective, and hydrodynamic properties of a specific
   system cannot be neglected if we try to understand and simulate
   microbial colonization. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid technology known as the ultrafiltration-biologically active
   carbon (UF-BAC) process that amalgamates adsorption, biodegradation and
   membrane filtration is found to be highly efficient for treatment of
   landfill leachates. The process employs bioactive powdered activated
   carbon (PAC) with a leachate-acclimated microbial culture for the
   simultaneous sorption and biodegradation of organic constituents.
   Tubular cross-flow ultrafiltration membrane modules separate out
   colloids and microorganisms, and a high quality permeate is obtained.
   Batch biokinetic studies were performed for the two leachates to
   evaluate their extent of biodegradability and biodegradation kinetics.
   The process efficiencies for both leachates were in the range of 95-98\%
   in terms of TOC removal, and exceeded 97\% for specific organic
   pollutants. The UF-BAC process compared well with the PACT process in
   terms of organic removal, and produced higher quality effluent in terms
   of suspended solids (100\% removal). The study demonstrated that
   addition of 1\% PAC mitigated permeate flux deterioration attributed to
   membrane fouling and concentration polarization, and enhanced permeate
   transport. Possible mechanisms for flux amelioration are discussed.

Abstract = {{This report describes results of a 14 month study of the fate of
   trace-metal contaminants in wetland microcosms. Duplicated wetland
   microcosms contained either cattail, Typha domingensis or duckweed,
   Lemma minor, as the dominant macrophyte. Each wetland microcosm received
   14.6 cm/day of dilute landfill leachate amended with lead (measured
   average: 396 mu g/l) and cadmium (measured average: 105 mu g/l). At
   intervals of approximately 3 months, sediments and macrophytes were
   sampled and analyzed for heavy metal content. Differences between
   measured trace-metal concentrations in inflow and outflow samples
   indicated that approximately half of the added lead and cadmium were
   retained in wetland microcosms. Of the fraction removed from the water,
   less than half could be accounted for in calculated sediment and plant
   tissue concentrations, based on analysis. The apparent discrepancy in
   mass balance calculations probably arises from failure to accurately
   measure bulk density of sediment detritus hoc, which contained a
   substantial amount of the trace metals. Measurement of sediment acid
   volatile sulfides (AVS), and comparisons of these concentrations to
   those of the added lead and cadmium, showed that nearly all of these
   trace metals were present in the sediments as sulfides, limiting
   bioavailability and toxicity of these elements. Results of analyses and
   a lack of overt biological effects suggest that in wetlands containing
   organic sediments, sediment chemistry dominates cycling of these trace
   metals. Plant accumulation is of secondary importance. Comparison of
   heavy-metal uptake by cattails and duckweed shows that duckweed, on a
   whole plant basis, accumulates lead and cadmium more effectively than
   does cattail. If plants were to be used in a biomass-harvesting process
   for metal bioremediation, duckweed appears to be a more suitable
   candidate than cattail because of high productivity and ease of
   harvesting, coupled with a significant bioaccumulation of lead and
   cadmium. Potential metal removal rates by duckweed are 3-8 mg Pb/m(2)
   day and 2-4 mg Cd/m(2) day. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Two methods were compared for the measurement of dissolved organic
   carbon (DOG) in waters collected from lakes, rivers and several
   pollution sources. Both the differential method (D-DOC method), derived
   from dissolved total carbon (DTC) minus DIC (dissolved inorganic
   carbon), and the purging method (P-DOC method), which purges DIC, were
   evaluated with a Shimadzu TOC-5000 with a high temperature catalytic
   oxidation system. Particularly in cases of gray water and/or water which
   had seeped through soil-layers, considerably lower concentrations were
   noted for P-DOC purged at around pH 2 than those measured by the D-DOC
   method or the P-DOC method at pH 4. DOC measurements for both field
   samples and specific compounds decreased due either to precipitation or
   flotation of colloidal organic particles insolubilized during sparging
   at pH 2 or 3 or to their incomplete combustion. The D-DOC method,
   exhibiting lower precision than the P-DOC method particularly for
   samples with high DIC vs DOC ratios, is, however, recommendable because

Abstract = {{On-line monitoring the state of coagulation/flocculation enables
   automatic control of coagulation process concerning the condition of the
   chemical additive. In this study, a new optical monitoring technique is
   employed to evaluate the extent of flocculation, which involves
   measuring the fluctuating light intensity transmitted through a flowing
   suspension. This technique functions as a sensitive monitor providing an
   empirical index related to the state of aggregation, and could form the
   basis of an on-line technique. The assessment for feasible application
   in monitoring the flocculation through this technique is the primary
   objective of this study. Also, a series of batch flocculation tests is
   performed under different conditions. These results indicate that the
   fiber-optical technique is useful in monitoring the state of aggregation
   with different coagulants and the variation of turbidity conditions.
   Furthermore, a reliable index related to the hoc size is provided and
   can be applied in determining the optimal dosage of coagulant. Copyright

Abstract = {{Heavy metals present in sewage sludges can be leached out, among other
   processes, by a process using a consortium of sulfur oxidizing bacteria.
   The metal leaching could be combined with aerobic sludge digestion to
   result in the Simultaneous Sludge Digestion and Metal Leaching (SSDML)
   process. A detailed knowledge of the effect of sulfur concentration on
   the pH variations of the sludge during the process is essential to a
   complete understanding of the process kinetics. To achieve this
   objective, SSDML experiments were conducted in Erlenmeyer flasks and 201
   reactors and the results were analysed. The sludge pH was seen to rise
   initially, which was attributed to a lag in the activity of sulfur
   oxidizing bacteria combined with the production of unidentified
   material, which are basic in their effect on the sludge pH. The lag
   period was found to depend on (i) the surface area of sulfur available
   for bacterial attachment and (ii) the number of bacteria present in the
   sludge capable of initiating bacterial colonies on these surfaces. The
   rate of change of sludge pH during the lag period was found to depend on
   the sludge pH itself and the two were related using a second degree
   polynomial. The specific growth and product formation rates of the
   sulfur oxidizing bacteria were found to vary linearly with the surface
   area of sulfur available when the bacterial metabolism was sulfur
   limited and mathematical relations were developed for the same. The rate
   constants were evaluated by calculating the instantaneous growth and
   sulfate formation rates and comparing the resultant change in the sludge
   pH with experimentally observed values. These equations were used to
   simulate the sulfate production and pH variations in the sludge for
   various conditions. The simulation results matched the experimental
   results very well, confirming the validity of the relations developed.

Abstract = {{A comparison of five methods used for the determination of dissolved
   total phosphorus (DTP) in natural waters is reported. The methods
   compared different approaches to oxidizing organic-P compounds, and
   destroying polyphosphates to give forms available to standard
   colorimetric methods. The methods used were ultraviolet (UV)
   irradiation, high-temperature treatment with magnesium persulphate,
   autoclaving under acidic or alkaline conditions, and magnesium nitrate
   oxidation. One series of experiments measured the oxidation efficiency
   of the methods when used with model organic-P compounds
   (phosphomonoesters, P-nucleosides, polyphosphates, metaphosphates, and
   phosphonates) which were diluted in fresh and sea waters. The methods
   were also applied to four different marine and fresh water samples
   containing naturally occurring dissolved organic-P and polymeric-P
   compounds. The five methods had on average a greater than 90\% oxidation
   efficiency for phosphomonoesters, including phospho-sugars and
   phosphonates. However, only the methods that include a hydrolysis step
   were able to satisfactorily depolymerize polyphosphates and
   metaphosphates as well as destroy the nucleosides
   adenosine-5-triphosphate and guanosine-5 diphosphate. The highest DTP
   concentrations in the natural water samples were obtained by the
   magnesium nitrate oxidation method, whilst the lowest values were given
   by the UV irradiation technique, implying that this latter commonly used
   technique can seriously underestimate DTP when resistant compounds
   represent a significant fraction of the DOP. Overall, the magnesium
   nitrate method was chosen as the best technique of those tested. In a
   slightly modified form the technique was used to determine particulate
   phosphorus in natural waters. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{A stoichiometric analysis for the evaluation of different process
   configurations for biological phosphorus removal (BPR) is developed.
   This analysis is a steady-state simplification of the general dynamic
   model of biological phosphorus removal developed previously. It provides
   a simple method to compare the phosphate uptake capacity and acetate
   requirement of different BPR process configurations like the mainstream
   and sidestream process. Based on the phosphate concentration in the
   influent and the system configuration, the minimal required
   concentration of phosphorus removing organisms (polyP-organisms) in the
   system, and the maximal phosphate/acetate-COD ratio of the influent to
   obtain full P-removal can be calculated. The phosphate/acetate-COD ratio
   of the influent can be used as one of the main parameters in the
   analysis of a process configuration. The acetate requirement for the
   sidestream process where P-removal in a stripper tank is applied is
   shown to be much lower than the requirements needed in a mainstream
   process. The required concentration of polyP-biomass in a sidestream
   process is 10 times lower. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science}},

Abstract = {{Convective mass transport in heterogeneous biofilms, consisting of cell
   clusters and voids, was investigated using oxygen microelectrodes.
   Oxygen concentration profiles were measured and contour plots
   constructed at different (average) how velocities (U-avg). The profiles
   were used to determine the thickness of the mass transfer boundary layer
   (delta(h)) above the voids and the cell clusters. The delta(h) above the
   biofilm was inversely related to flow, as expected, and decreased
   exponentially with increasing flow velocity. However, the delta(h) above
   the voids decreased more rapidly than the delta(h) above the cell
   clusters resulting in two distinct situations; at low flow velocities
   the oxygen contours were parallel to the substratum but at high
   velocities were parallel to the irregular biofilm surface. It was
   concluded that at low how velocities the biofilm could be modeled
   one-dimensionally, with fluxes perpendicular to the substratum and the
   exchange area being equal to the substratum area, but at higher
   velocities biofilm voids facilitate mass transport and a more complex,
   three-dimensional model would be more appropriate. In this latter case
   fluxes are multidirectional, and the exchange area is equal to that of
   the convoluted biofilm surface. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{A batch culture of microorganisms can be classified to substrate-limited
   and substrate-sufficient growth according to the relative availability
   of the substrate to biomass, i.e. the S-0/X(0) ratio. It is generally
   observed that the growth yields are greater at lower S-0/X(0) ratios
   than at higher S-0/X(0) ratios. The excess substrate should cause
   serious uncoupling between anabolism and catabolism leading to energy
   spilling. Based on a balance on substrate reaction, the total quantity
   of substrate consumed by microorganisms is taken to be the sums of the
   quantity of substrate utilization for growth, the quantity of substrate
   utilization for maintenance and that due to energy spilling, a kinetic
   model is proposed to describe the dependence of the observed growth
   yield on the S-0/X(0) ratio for substrate-sufficient batch culture. It
   is demonstrated that decline in the observed growth yield with
   increasing the S-0/X(0) ratio is mainly due to energy spilling under
   substrate-sufficient conditions. The proposed model describes the
   literature data satisfactorily. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Colour is a useful index of dissolved humic substances,in water. The
   reference method for colour determination is a visual comparison of
   samples with reference solutions of hexachloroplatinate, the Hazen
   method. The precision of this method is poor in relation to common
   drinking water criteria. A spectrophotometric method with better
   precision that gives results on the same scale as the Hazen method is
   described in this paper. Filtration is crucial before spectrophotometric
   measurement. We found no effect of filtration on true colour. The method
   has been validated through interlaboratory comparisons. Forty
   laboratories using this method obtained the same mean values as 20
   laboratories using visual judgement. The standard deviations of
   spectrophotometric measurements were half the values of visual
   determinations. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{A lignin model compound (4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid) was
   chlorinated under conditions similar to those used in drinking water
   treatment. Various chlorophenols were identified in solvent extracts

   chlorovanillins. Compounds identified as significant disinfection
   by-products in chlorinated drinking waters (chloroform, dichloroacetic
   acid, tricholoracetic acid and
   3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone) were associated
   with higher chlorine doses (satisfying 75\% of the chlorine demand).
   Filtered, biologically treated thermomechanical (TMP) and
   chemithermomechanical (CTMP) effluents diluted in natural waters were
   chlorinated at doses which ensured a measurable free chlorine residual
   after 20 h. Aquatic humic substances in natural waters influenced the
   impact of mill effluents on drinking water quality. Detected by-products
   included the chlorinated disinfection by-products noted above, but only
   one detectable chlorophenol, 2,4,6,-trichlorophenol. By-product
   concentrations were higher in solutions containing CTMP mill effluents
   and humic river water. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring data and dose-response models were used to evaluate risks
   associated with viruses and protozoa at a full-scale reclamation
   facility. Indigenous indicator and pathogenic microorganisms were
   monitored at different stages of treatment for 1 yr at a full-scale
   water reclamation facility that produced reclaimed water for residential
   irrigation. The combination of biological treatment, sand filtration,
   and chlorination employed at the plant reduced total and fecal coliforms
   by > 7 log(10) and coliphages and enteroviruses by > 5 log(10). Protozoa
   (Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp.) were reduced by > 3 log(10). Viruses
   and protozoa were detected in the reclaimed water at levels between 0.01
   and 5 per 100 l. The addition of large numbers of bacteriophage as a
   tracer permitted an assessment of inactivation and/or removal by the
   filtration and chlorination units, which were shown to provide 1.6 and
   1.5 log(10) reductions, respectively. Analysis of the risk associated
   with exposure to the reclaimed water shows that the probability of
   infection following a single exposure to 100 mi of the water was between
   10(-6) (1 in a million) and 10(-8) (1 in 100 million) for landscape
   irrigation. In general, anaerobic treatment of residual solids produced
   during the wastewater treatment process reduced the levels of indicator
   and pathogenic microorganisms by approximately 1 log(10). The levels of
   viruses detected in the final residual would not meet acceptable levels
   for land application for class A residuals according to EPA regulations.

Abstract = {{the Atlantic Coastal Plain, riparian wetlands are thought to play an
   important role in the removal of NO3- from groundwater. The
   denitrification potential of the Bibb (coarse-loamy, siliceous, acid,
   thermic Typic Fluvaquents) series, located in the Nomini Creek
   Watershed, Virginia, was evaluated in the laboratory using soil columns
   under saturated flow conditions. Soil columns were infiltrated with
   synthetic groundwater containing 3.2 +/- 0.1 mmol NO3--N (44 +/- 2.0 mg
   NO3--N l(-1)). Soil samples were collected from two surface horizons and
   one subsurface horizon in May (soil temperature 16.4 degrees C),
   September (19.9 degrees C), and November (13.5 degrees C) of 1993 at 12
   sites along the stream. Denitrification rates (N2O-N evolution in the
   presence of acetylene) were significantly higher for soils incubated at
   19.9 degrees C than at 16.4 or 13.5 degrees C. The highest mean
   denitrification rates were measured in the ponded surface horizon (0.40
   +/- 0.17 mu mol N2O-N (g DW)(-1) d(-1) at 16.4 degrees C, 0.65 +/- 0.27
   at 19.9 degrees C, 0.40 +/- 0.25 at 13.5 degrees C) in comparison to the
   terrestrial surface (0.17 +/- 0.11, 0.28 +/- 0.13, 0.16 +/- 0.11) and
   subsurface (0.04 +/- 0.02, 0.11 +/- 0.06, 0.04 +/- 0.01) horizons. Rates
   of denitrification were significantly correlated with organic carbon for
   the ponded surface horizon across all three temperatures. For the
   terrestrial surface and subsurface horizons, organic carbon was related
   to denitrification rates for only those soils incubated at 13.5 degrees
   C. Relations between NO3- loss and denitrification rates were present
   for the terrestrial surface horizon across all temperatures, and at 13.5
   and 16.4 degrees C for the ponded surface and subsurface horizons.
   Spatial variability accounted for less than 10\% of the variation in
   denitrification rates, while soil horizon amounted to about 50\%. Within
   the soil columns, the relative NO3- concentration decreased rapidly with
   increasing temperature in the surface horizons but much less so in the
   subsurface horizon. For the surface horizons, incubated at the higher
   temperatures, NO3- concentration in the effluent was very low,
   suggesting that denitrification may have been limited by NO3-
   availability. The denitrification potential for the surface horizons was
   very high, related in part to the high levels of organic carbon present
   in those horizons. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Exchangeable phosphate represents a reservoir of bioavailable
   phosphorus, since it can be rapidly released into a water body when the
   soluble phosphate concentration decreases. In the absence of a clear
   definition we first propose to precisely define exchangeable phosphate
   with reference to phosphate released in extreme conditions of solid
   dilution. A survey of the literature indicates that a variety of methods
   have been developed to provide its determination The theoretical
   approach behind the corresponding release experiments is presented to
   support an evaluation of these methods with respect to the definition
   given. It appears that most are not based on the rigorous application of
   thermodynamic principles. Therefore, we have presented an infinite
   dilution extrapolation (IDE) approach, both rigorous and simple,
   enabling reliable comparison to be made. The method is based on
   extraction in natural water or a soluble substitute. The effect of pH
   was studied. Experimental conditions for use of the described method
   have been developed and various side applications are shown such as
   comparison of the extracting power of extractants. Results of
   application to estuarine sediments are briefly presented. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Levels of faecal bacteria, somatic coliphages and bacteriophages of
   Bacteroides fragilis were counted in marine sediments and groundwater as
   representatives of environments with remote faecal pollution.
   Additionally, enterovirus were measured in the marine sediments. Clear
   changes of the proportions of the different microorganisms are observed
   when microbial numbers in groundwater and marine sediments are compared
   to the numbers found in sewage or water recently polluted by sewage.
   These changes show that phages of B. fragilis reach sites that receive
   persistent pollution more successfully than somatic coliphages or
   indicator bacteria, with the exception of Clostridium perfringens.
   Multifactorial analysis of marine sediments and groundwater data
   clustered phages, viruses and C. perfringens in one factor and faecal
   bacteria in another. These data clearly suggest that Clostridium, phages
   of B. fragilis and, in some cases enteroviruses, are better index
   microorganisms of remote faecal pollution than present bacterial
   indicators. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

   was irradiated to u.v. doses ranging from 34.5 to 95 mWs/cm(2) and was
   subsequently incubated from 1 to 5 h in diffusion chambers placed in a
   large open-air sea-water tank. The bacterial concentrations before u.v.
   were of the order of 4 log units. No repair was observed for the
   enterococci. On the other hand, an increase in the number of Escherichia
   coli after 3 h incubation was observed in 82\% of counts. The repair
   rate (RR) of E. call decreased when the u.v. dose increased. The RR were
   always less than 0.001 for doses above 44 mWs/cm(2). For such doses, the
   increase in the number of E. call after the disinfection is low (between
   0.1 and 0.6 log units). No relationship was observed between the repair
   rate and the luminous dose. (300-800 nn) received during the incubation.
   From this work we can conclude that, 1) under conditions approaching
   actual post-disinfection situations, the repair of E. coli after
   disinfection by uv. is small and 2) the parameter determining the repair
   rate of E. coli is the u.v. irradiation dose. Copyright (C) 1996

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{During anaerobic treatment of sulfate containing wastewaters, sulfate
   reducing bacteria (SRB) and methane producing bacteria (MPB) can compete
   for acetate as the common primary substrate. Since acetate is an
   intermediate of anaerobic degradation of complex wastes, the outcome of
   the competition between SRB and MPB can affect the treatment efficiency.
   The objective of this research was to determine the effects of feed
   acetate to sulfate ratio and redox potential on the interaction between
   SRB and MPB. Both batch serum bottles and chemostats were used for this
   study. The acetate degradation rate constants (k in Monod model). were
   found to be 2.4 and 3.2/d for SRB and MPB, respectively, and the Monod
   half velocity coefficients (K-s) were found to be 102 and 116 mg/l for
   SRB and MPB, respectively. As the feed acetate/SO42- ratio was increased
   from 0.66 to 3.33, the percent acetate utilized by SRB decreased from 71
   to only 4\% in chemostats and from 40 to 12\% in batch serum bottles.
   The percent acetate utilized by the SRB increased from 19 to 35\% when
   the redox potential was changed from -175 to -75 mV in additional
   Eh-stat experiments. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a computation scheme that considers accuracy and
   efficiency in the numerical treatment of the kinetic processes in water
   quality models. The proposed scheme involves decoupling of physical
   transport and kinetic processes in the governing mass-balance equations.
   The decoupled equations are solved by employing multi-step computation,
   in which the kinetic processes are applied for the first half time step,
   followed by the physical transport for a full time step, and the kinetic
   processes are applied again for the remaining second half time step. The
   kinetic equations are solved numerically or analytically, which may
   require prior linearization of the equations. The numerical solution
   scheme of the kinetic equations alternates between explicit and implicit
   schemes, and is equivalent to the second-order accurate Crank-Nicolson
   solution. A hypothetical model, which is simple enough to have an
   analytical solution, is used to explain the concept, and to demonstrate
   the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed scheme. The
   proposed scheme and three other traditional solution schemes are
   compared to the analytical solution. The proposed scheme shows better
   accuracy and computational efficiency compared to other schemes.

Abstract = {{Metal concentrations in hydropsychid larvae inhabiting an acid,
   metal-polluted river were studied in relation to the incidence of
   morphological abnormalities and variation in their stage of development.
   The significantly higher Al concentrations in the abnormal larvae as
   compared to the levels measured in the normal larvae suggest that the
   aluminium accumulated in the Hydropsyche pellucidula larvae
   significantly contributes to the occurrence of morphological
   abnormalities. The comparison of metal concentrations between unmoulted
   and newly moulted larvae indicates that the main proportion of the iron
   is adsorbed on the body surface, whereas much of the aluminium, cadmium,
   copper, lead and zinc is also absorbed in the tissues. The average
   concentrations of Cd and Cu were significantly higher in the newly
   moulted than in the unmoulted larvae. It is suggested that either
   moulting enhances accumulation of Cd and Cu or these metals enhance
   moulting of the larvae. The results indicate that in bioaccumulation and
   monitoring studies utilizing aquatic insect larvae, more attention
   should be paid to the condition of the individuals. The incidence of
   morphological abnormalities in hydropsychid larvae appears to be a
   useful tool for impact assessment and the biomonitoring of
   metal-polluted streams. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Title = {{Long-term phosphorus budgets and an examination of a steady-state mass

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate, modify if necessary, and
   calibrate a mass balance steady-state total phosphorus (TP) model for
   use in the Precambrian Shield area of Ontario. Hydrologic data, TP mass
   balances and lake concentrations data were collected between June 1978
   and May 1992 from seven oligotrophic and oligomesotrophic lakes located
   on the Precambrian Shield in central Ontario. Two of the lakes (Dickie
   and Harp) had substantial shoreline development; four lakes had
   alkalinities <25 mu eql(-1). The gross settling or loss coefficient, v,
   was underestimated when internal load was ignored. Long-term mean rr
   ranged about three-fold, from 4.7 m yr(-1) in Plastic Lake to 13.7 m
   yr(-1) in Dickie Lake with an average for six lakes of 7.9 m yr(-1). The
   exception was Harp Lake where v was 23.2 m yr(-1). The difference in v
   between heavily developed Dickie and Harp Lakes may have been due to the
   unusually thick glacial tills in the Harp catchment and their likely
   ability to retain at least some of the TP from septic effluent. The
   current inability to predict septic TP retention rates by soils/tills,
   the highly variable nature of soils/tills, and the decades required to
   reach equilibrium after installation leave environmental managers with
   little choice but to apply the `'precautionary principle'' to ensure
   adequate protection of inland recreational waters and assume that soils
   do not retain septic TP. There was no evidence that enhanced
   sedimentation of TP (''oligotrophication'') occurred in any of the three
   most acidic lakes. In fact, losses via sedimentation were lowest in
   these lakes. Average retention, R ((input-output)/input) of TP during
   the ice-free months of May to November was much higher than average R in
   winter (December-April) in all lakes. Lack of wind-induced mixing, low
   biological activity and thermal stratification caused by ice cover make
   it more likely that stream loads are discharged directly from lakes
   during winter. Seasonal variation in retention suggests that R and v
   should be higher in warmer climatic zones. There may be no globally
   valid v, although the data presented here suggest that a regionally
   applicable estimate of v may be appropriate. The model should only be
   calibrated with a long-term data set and should be only used to predict
   long-term, average responses to changes in average TP loading. Copyright

Abstract = {{The constructed wetland (CW) in Gradisce (Slovenia) has been in
   operation since 1991 for the purification of waste waters from a food
   processing plant. It functions according to the method of horizontal
   subsurface flow. Waste waters are composed of industrial, Faecal and
   meteor waters. The CW is composed of two beds, filled with substrate and
   planted with Cater gracilis and Phragmites australis. Average hydraulic
   loading of the CW is 5 m(3) d(-1). A high COD average value of 3674 mg
   l(-1) and a BOD5 average value of 962 mg l(-1) are characteristic of
   influent waters. Analysis showed that pollution decreased with regard to
   COD by 92\%, BOD5 89\%, orthophosphate 96\%, ammonium 86\% and nitrate
   65\%. The microbiological parameters indicated that the total number of
   coliform bacteria is reduced by 99\% and the number of faecal
   streptococci by 98\%. Results demonstrated that the CW can be
   appropriate for treating waste waters from the food processing plants.

Abstract = {{Leeches (Nephelopsis obscura Verrill) were evaluated as potential
   biomonitors of chlorinated phenolic compounds discharged from bleached
   pulp mills using semi-static laboratory bioassays of 1 week duration.
   The effect of factors such as contaminant concentration, water pH, water
   temperature and leech weight upon bioconcentration were examined.
   There was a strong linear correlation (r(2) = 0.89-0.96) between water
   contaminant concentration (0.1-10 mu g/l,) and bioconcentration of
   chloroguaiacols, with slow depuration rates (t(1/2) greater than or
   equal to 28 days), indicating that both the quantities and proportions
   of contaminant may be estimated from bioconcentration data.
   Environmental conditions affected leech bioconcentration.
   Bioconcentration of chloroguaiacols was inversely related to pH
   (5.1-9.0), but was only weakly correlated with the concentration of
   undissociated compound, indicating that the ionized compound also
   contributed to the bioavailable fraction. Bioconcentration increased
   between 4.4 and 11.8 degrees C, but did not show a significant change
   from 11.8 to 20.0 degrees C A strong inverse relationship (r(2) =
   0.09-0.94) between leech weight and bioconcentration indicated that
   routine biomonitoring using leeches would benefit from a uniform
   laboratory-reared leech stock. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Leeches (Nephelopsis obscura Verrill) were evaluated as ill situ
   biomonitors of chlorinated phenolic compounds in the Fraser River al
   Prince George, BC, downstream from three bleached kraft pulp mills
   practising chlorine dioxide (ClO2) substitution. Five biomonitoring
   periods, of 7 days duration, were selected to cover a full range of
   seasonal river conditions.
   Leeches bioconcentrated tri- and tetrachlorinated phenolics
   (bioconcentration factors: 465-6000) in proportions similar to those
   present in both mill effluent and river water. Leeches showed
   3,4,5-trichloroguaiacol (3,4,5-TCG) to be the most consistent tracer of
   bleached kraft mill discharge. Leeches provided direct evidence that
   increasing ClO2 substitution reduces amounts of chlorinated phenolics
   accumulated by aquatic organisms, with sharp decreases observed at ClO2
   levels greater than 90\%. This study suggests that leeches could be
   applied as routine biomonitors for environmental impact monitoring.

Abstract = {{A procedure for purifying waters polluted with metal ions has been
   designed. The method is based on the precipitation of metals as magnetic
   ferrite from the alkalinised solution containing iron(II). The working
   conditions were optimised by using a Taguchi L(9)(3(4)) experimental
   design in order to minimise the total residual concentration (TRC) of
   metal ions in solution. A statistical analysis of the experimental data
   revealed the most influential factor to be the Fe(II)/metal
   concentration ratio (F), with a 29.5\% contribution, followed by pH (P,
   5.2\%) and time (H, 2.3\%). On the other hand, temperature (T) had
   little effect on the purification efficiency (1.0\%), whereas noise (N,
   KMnO4) was found to contribute by as much as 22.1\%. Maximal
   purification efficiency (99.99\%) is achieved when wastewater samples
   are treated for 3 h at 50 degrees C and pH 10 in the presence of
   iron(II) in a ratio Fe(II)/total metal of 15. In these conditions, the
   process efficiency is also the least influenced by variability in the
   sample composition, which validates the proposed procedure. Copyright

Abstract = {{The abilities of zero-valent iron powder and hydrogen with a palladium
   catalyst (H-2/Pd-alumina) to hydrodehalogenate
   1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP) to propane under water treatment
   conditions (ambient temperature and circumneutral pH) were compared.
   DBCP reacted with iron powder (100-200 mesh, 36 g/l) in HERES-buffered
   water (pH = 7.0) with a tin of 2.5 min and in different groundwaters (pH
   = 8.2-8.7) with a t(1/2) ranging from 41-77 min. Dissolved O-2 and NO3-
   slowed the transformation, whereas sulfate and nitrite had little
   effect. Iron removed 60 mg/l of nitrate within 14 min with nitrite as an
   intermediate. In 75 mi groundwater containing 22.5 mg 1\% Pd-alumina
   catalyst under 10\% H-2 partial pressure, DBCP was transformed to
   propane within minutes. The rate in groundwater was slower by about 30\%
   compared to Milli-Q(tm) water. SO42-, NO3-, Cl- or O-2 added to Milli-Q
   water only slightly inhibited DBCP transformation by H-2/Pd-alumina,
   while SO32- had a much stronger inhibitory affect. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{A full-scale sewage treatment plant designed for biological phosphorus
   removal may experience short- or long-term shortage in potassium of the
   influent. In this study, using an anaerobic-aerobic sequenced batch
   reactor system, inoculation sludge from laboratory-, pilot- and
   full-scale phosphorus removal plants was exposed to different
   potassium-phosphorus ratios in the influent. By simulating the
   conditions which may occur in practice, it was shown that potassium is
   an essential factor in biological phosphorus removal processes. When the
   system was exposed to severe shortage of potassium in the influent: (a)
   phosphorus removal was absent, (b) polyphosphate concentration in the
   biomass decreased exponentially due to sludge wasting and (c) the
   anaerobic phosphorus release and the related acetate uptake was only
   affected after several days of potassium absence, likely due to
   insufficient content of polyphosphate in the biomass to allow full
   acetate uptake under anaerobic conditions. In contrast, the system
   achieved complete phosphorus removal when potassium was present in
   excess amounts. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the results of a series of analyses designed to
   identify possible mathematical relationships between the numbers of
   fecal streptococci vs the numbers of enteroviruses present (as measured
   by the enterovirus assay) in marine recreational waters in order to
   indirectly assess the relationship between enteroviral densities and
   subsequent risk of gastroenteritis among bathers exposed to marine
   waters contaminated with domestic sewage. A database consisting of 2066
   parallel fecal streptococci and enterovirus enumerations taken from 416
   different marine water locations throughout the United Kingdom was used
   in the analyses. Polychotomous logistic regression was used to model the
   probabilities of zero enterovirus, a possible infectious dose and a
   probable infectious dose of enterovirus being present over increasing
   fecal streptococci densities. The results of the polychotomous logistic
   regression analyses showed that the probability of the absence of
   enterovirus (i.e., zero enteroviruses being present) remained higher
   than the probability of the presence of either a possible or probable
   infectious dose in 101 of seawater up to a fecal streptococci density of
   1000/100 mi of sample (actual estimated probabilities for the three
   groupings of enterovirus densities described above, at a fecal
   streptococci density of 1000 equaled 0.44, 0.44, and 0.12,
   respectively). In addition, the probability of zero enteroviruses being
   present remained higher than the probability of one or more
   enteroviruses being present in 101 of seawater up to a fecal
   streptococci density of 450/100 mi of sample. Since previously published
   epidemiological studies have shown an excess risk of gastroenteritis to
   occur among bathers exposed to as few as 32 fecal streptococci per 100
   mi of sample, these results suggest that the actual viruses enumerated
   by the enterovirus assay are not etiologically related to recreational
   water-associated gastroenteritis. Since gastroenteritis has been the
   most consistently reported bathing water associated illness, these
   findings suggest the enterovirus assay to be of limited use in assessing
   marine recreational water quality given the increasing tendency to
   formulate water quality standards based on increased risk of
   gastroenteritis among bathers relative to non-bathers. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Low-load activated sludge treatment plants are by far the most numerous
   and are continuing to develop given their enhanced capacity for nitrogen
   removal. In general, the electrical consumption of aerators accounts for
   around 80\% of total electrical consumption. It can therefore easily be
   understood that it is important to be able to evaluate the oxygen
   requirement for biological treatment as accurately as possible. This
   evaluation of oxygen requirement is made by the designer during the
   project phase, using the conventional formula {[}O-2 =
   1/alpha(a'Le+b'Xv+c'N)]. While this approach is entirely satisfactory
   for the designer (who essentially needs to know the adequate oxygenation
   capacity), it meets the needs of the operator only imperfectly; the
   latter needs to know the specific electrical consumption of the aerators
   as accurately as possible (SEC-kWh.kgBOD(5)(-1)). It is for this reason
   that an alternative method has been developed allowing calculation of
   the oxygen requirement for biological treatment (ODCW-
   kgO(2).kgBOD(5)(-1)) and specific aerator consumption
   (SEC-kWh.kgBOD(5)(-1)) for low-load activated sludge type plants
   (Charpentier, 1988). Initially, an ODCW-standard value is obtained, by
   calculation or from a graph, from the desired concentration in TKN or
   NH4+. N for the effluent. ODCWstandard=mass of Oxygen which the aerators
   must be able to dissolve in clean water for 1 kg of BOD5 to be
   eliminated in `'standard'' operating conditions. For `'non-standard''
   operating conditions (volumetric load <0.18 kg BOD5.m(-1).d(-1);
   {[}VSS](aeration)not equal 3 g.l(-1); {[}TKN/BOD5](influent)not equal
   0.25; {[}BOD5](influent) > 1000 mg O-2.1(-1)), the ODCWstandard value
   must be combined with correction factors k(1), k(2), k(3), and k(4) of
   which the values and conditions of application have been defined:
   ODCWplant=ODCW(standard)xk(1)k(2)k(3)k(4)
   SED=ODCWplant/SOTR

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of solids abatement by pH increase was investigated
   using the jar test procedure with a bentonite tap water suspension and
   an urban wastewater and an oxidation pond effluent. The results
   indicated that, depending on the suspended particles and on the
   dissolved ions, pH values between 9.5 and 12 induced extensive solids
   elimination without adding any other chemical than a base, i.e. sodium
   hydroxide or lime. The major effective reactions are then the calcium
   carbonate precipitation and the magnesium hydroxide precipitation.
   Moreover, this process does not require a flocculation step but only a
   precipitation step where the particles are entrapped by sweep
   coagulation and adsorption-coagulation. A continuous reactor was
   operated with an oxidation pond effluent. A suspended solids
   concentration less than 30 mg/l was obtained by adjusting pH between 11
   and 11.5 while the reactor was operated up to 20 m/h superficial upflow
   velocity corresponding to a residence time through the whole unit of 5
   min only. The sludge settling velocity depends on pH and on the primary
   particles but a maximum settling velocity larger than 1 m/h is easily
   reached. The concentration factor is then about 100. Copyright (C) 1996

   flows}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2363-2370}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A method for the determination of the settling velocity for sludge as a
   function of turbulence intensity and sludge concentration has been
   developed. The principle of the method is to continuously feed the top
   of a settling column with sludge so that a steady state and uniform
   concentration distribution occurs in the middle of the column. This
   eliminates time scale effects such as flocculation from the
   measurements, as the resulting settling velocity only can be found at
   steady stale and uniform conditions. The method assumes that flocculated
   sludge settles faster than disintegrated sludge to make a mass balance
   involving concentration at the top and at the middle of the column as
   well as the inlet sludge flow. The resulting mass balance is used to
   calculate a local settling velocity. The turbulence is introduced by an
   oscillating grid in the whole depth of the settling column. Settling
   velocities can be measured at arbitrarily selected combinations of
   turbulence and concentration. The foremost advantage of the method is
   that settling characteristics measured in this way can be utilized
   directly in numerical models of sedimentation tanks, process tanks, etc.

Abstract = {{Formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) was investigated in water treated
   with chlorine dioxide (ClO2) and/or chlorine (Cl-2) where humic acid
   (HA) was used as THMs precursors. When ClO2 was used as the only
   disinfectant, no THMs were detected in bromide-free water; while only
   CHBr3 was formed in water containing bromide ion because ClO2 could
   oxide bromide to form hydrobromous acid which subsequently reacted with
   HA, and the yield CHBr3 increased with bromide concentration and ClO2
   dosing. When water was treated with ClO2 combined with Cl-2, only CHCl3
   was formed in the absence of bromide, however, all four species of THMs
   were formed in the presence of bromide; the THMs formation potential
   decreased gradually with an increase in the ratio of ClO2 to Cl-2
   because ClO2 reacted with HA to render them unreactive or unavailable
   for THMs production. When water (with or without bromide ion) was
   irradiated by light, the yield of THMs was increased as a function of
   irradiation time to a maximum, and thereafter decreased markedly; the
   possible mechanism is that irradiation could activate the THMs
   precursors in HA, and at the same time destroy the reactivity of ClO2 or
   Cl-2. The same results could be collected from natural water treated by
   ClO2 with or without irradiation. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Twelve toxic cyanobacterial bloom samples collected in natural lakes,
   reservoirs and rivers of Portugal were analysed. Toxicity was evaluated
   by mouse LD(50) bioassay of the lyophilised samples. The main bloom
   species present in the samples were Microcystis aeruginosa, Microcystis
   wesenbergii, Anabaena flos-aquae and Nostoc sp. Toxins were extracted,
   isolated by reverse phase HPLC and characterised by HPLC amino acid
   analysis and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. Two to seven
   microcystins were purified from each sample, and a total of seven
   different toxins were isolated and their structure assigned. MCYST-LR
   was the most common and its proportion in each sample ranged from 45.5\%
   to 99.8\% of the total microcystin contents. MCYST-RR, MCYST-YR and
   {[}D-Asp(3)]MCYST-LR were also identified in the samples. Three less
   common microcystins, MCYST-HilR, {[}L-MeSer(7)]MCYST-LR and
   {[}Dha(7)]MCYST-LR, were found in only one sample. Total MCYST
   concentration varied from 1.0 to 7.1 mu g/mg dry weight of
   cyanobacteria. Significant relationships between LD(50)-MCYST-LR-total
   MCYST content were found. The need for monitoring cyanobacteria and
   their toxins in eutrophic waters that are used for drinking and
   recreation purposes is discussed. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Cross-flow microfiltration using submerged membrane with air bubbling
   can provide a continuous solid-liquid separation system by simple
   equipment, such as a low-rate suction pump, an air blower and a vessel.
   In this system, the size of the separation module could be reduced by
   using hollow fiber membranes packed in high density. In order to apply
   this beneficial process to a wastewater treatment bioreactor, we
   constructed filtration models to design the membrane system. Higher
   transmembrane pressure and lower fluidity of feed operations (e.g.
   transmembrane pressure of over 40 kPa and air-liquid two phase flow
   velocity, u{*}, of under 0.5 m . s(-1)) caused the rapid crowding of
   hollow-fiber membrane elements and reduced the effective membrane
   surface area. Under the conditions that do not cause the rapid crowding,
   the steady-state filtration flux, J(ss), is expressed as J(ss) = V-L =
   K'.phi . u({*}1.0). MLSS(-0.5) where, V-L, K' and phi were lift
   velocity, filtration constant and the geometric hindrance coefficient of
   membrane module, respectively. The J(ss) values of hollow fiber
   membranes corresponded to that of rigid tubular ceramic membranes packed
   in low density. In this study, we defined the conditions that the hollow
   fiber membrane module packed in high density could be applied for
   solid-liquid separation. The flexibility and movability of hollow fiber
   membrane elements could not improve the flux. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{Three methods of chromium speciation were assessed in relation to
   possible interferences from Cr(III)-organic complexes. They were,
   namely: 1,5-diphenyl-carbazide (DPC) spectrophotometry, organic
   extraction with methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) and co-precipitation with
   iron and bismuth salts. Initially, a number of organic ligands, i.e.
   proteins, amino acids and organic acids were reacted with Cr(III) and
   only those complexes with solubility levels above that of ionic Cr(III)
   were assessed further. The spectrophotometric method was found to suffer
   minor interferences which were attributable to a non-specific turbidity
   effect. In comparison, two methods of MIRK extraction were found to
   suffer severe interferences with Cr(III)-protein complexes. Also,
   co-precipitation with iron salts resulted in high levels of
   contamination by Cr(III)-organic complexes in the ionic chromium
   fractions. Due to the poor solubility of bismuth salts, this method was
   discarded. The results demonstrate that chromium speciation in the
   presence of organic complexes can lead to erroneous results. However,
   with recognition of the presence of such complexes, corrections can be
   made. Since the co-precipitation behaviour of organic Cr(III) appears to
   be relatively specific, a scheme is described for the speciation of
   Cr(III) in tannery contaminated waterways. In addition, it is recommeded
   that a separate determination of Cr(VI) is conducted using a
   modification of the DPC method. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{The forms and transformations of chromium were characterised in the
   effluent of an Irish tannery before and after discharge into an estuary.
   The three primary effluent streams in the tannery were studied, i.e. the
   chrome and sulphide streams and the final composite effluent. Chromium
   was fully speciated in the final effluent, the discharge plume, and in
   the estuary outside discharge periods. The partitioning Of chromium was
   also studied in the sediments, and transformations due to the
   remobilisation and oxidation of Cr(III) were followed. These data were
   compared to a reference site. Mixing of the chrome and sulphide streams
   resulted in the binding of Cr(III) to organic ligands, notably proteins.
   The speciation of chromium in the final effluent was dominated by
   Cr(III) particulates with a mean concentration of 72.4 mg Cr l(-1). Some
   80-90\% of these particulates were inorganic while 10-20\% were bound to
   organic ligands. Dissolved concentrations averaged 3.6 mg l(-1) at pH
   10. However, a 45\% fall in dissolved Cr(III) was recorded after
   lowering the pH of the final effluent to that of the receiving waterway,
   i.e. pH 7.6-8.1. Approximately 50\% of the remainder was determined to
   be bound to proteinaceous ligands with 50\% bound to stable organic
   ligands. However, only the latter species was detectable in the water
   column outside discharge periods. Low levels of dissolved organic
   Cr(III) were also found to leach from both control and contaminated
   sediments, although concentrations were higher in the contaminated
   sediments. Cr(VI) was undetectable in the estuary (<3 mu g l(-1)) and
   local sediments were found not to oxidise Cr(III) in the effluent. In
   comparison, a number of sediments obtained from other sites readily
   oxidised experimentally added Cr(III) in the tannery effluent matrix.
   Elevated levels of organic and inorganic chromium in suspended solids
   were detectable at all sites studied in the contaminated estuary.
   Sediment Cr concentrations corrected for grain size were also elevated
   at all sites with highest concentrations being associated with fine
   grain sediments. However, total Cr concentrations in the sediments were
   relatively low compared to other tannery contaminated sites due to good
   dispersion of the effluent in the estuary. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Transport and deposition of colloidal Fe, Mn and Al oxides play key
   roles in the cycling of toxic transition metals in aquatic environments
   because these colloids strongly bind transition metals. Further,
   attachment of biological cells and biofilm growth on surfaces can
   indirectly affect toxic metal distribution by influencing the deposition
   of colloidal oxides to surfaces. To elucidate the mechanisms governing
   these processes, deposition of colloidal oxides onto surfaces must be
   evaluated in the presence of suspended and adherent bacterial cells.
   Both particle size and concentration are expected to influence
   deposition. An experimental protocol was developed to determine the size
   distribution of iron colloids in mixtures with suspended cells. A
   Ti(III) reagent was used to reduce and dissolve colloidal Fe(III) from
   mixtures containing both suspended cells and Fe colloids. The size
   distribution of Fe(III) colloids in the original solution was then
   determined from the difference between size distributions before and
   after dissolution of Fe with Ti(III). The Ti(III) reagent dissolved over
   95\% of the Fe colloids without altering the size distribution of
   suspended bacterial cells, and the method accurately determined the size
   distribution of Fe colloids added to cell suspensions. The applicability
   of this protocol was tested by applying it to a study of the deposition
   of Fe(III) oxide particles onto glass surfaces with and without biofilms
   of the bacterium Burkholdaria cepacia 17616. Experimental results using
   a laboratory biofilm reactor indicated that the deposition rate of
   Fe(III) colloids was not significantly affected by the presence of B.
   cepacia biofilms or by the presence of previously deposited Fe. However,
   deposition of Fe to reactor surfaces other than the glass surfaces may
   have interfered with the analyses, and atomic absorption measurements
   showed a slight increase in Fe deposition onto glass surfaces with
   biofilms present. Fe deposition to the composite of all reactor surfaces
   increased with increasing colloidal particle size, indicating a
   dominance of interception and/or sedimentation in controlling Fe
   deposition on surfaces in the biofilm reactor. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{An iron-bearing material deriving from surface finishing operations in
   the manufacturing of cast-iron components demonstrates potential for
   removal of heavy metals from aqueous waste streams. Batch isotherm and
   rate experiments were conducted for uptake of cadmium, zinc, and lead.
   In the pH range of 4-7, the iron sorbent had the highest capacity, on a
   mass-per-mass basis, for lead followed by zinc and cadmium. As
   anticipated, solution pH has a notable impact on metal removal, while
   ionic background and initial metal concentration exhibited a lesser
   impact on adsorptive behavior. Metal surface complexation with a
   developing oxide layer is postulated as the principal mechanism of heavy
   metal removal. Batch adsorption kinetics are quite rapid, with 90\% or
   more of metal uptake occurring within the first 5-10 h of reaction for
   powdered fines. Larger, granular-sized particles exhibited a longer,
   slower approach toward the equilibrium position. Surface complexation as
   well as semi-empirical equilibrium and rate models provided a useful
   description of experimental phenomena in that conditional trends were
   reflected in the estimated values of the model coefficients. Given the
   availability and comparable metal uptake capacity of the recycled iron
   sorbent to natural metal oxides and some commercial adsorbents, use of
   the iron-bearing material offers potential environmental and economic
   benefit for certain industrial pretreatment applications. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Polyurethane foam has been studied as a support for anaerobic sludge
   immobilization in packed-bed bioreactors. Studies about fundamental

   effect of the liquid superficial velocity on the wash-out of anaerobic
   biomass and the evaluation of the external mass transfer resistance are
   presented in this paper. The polyurethane foam cubic matrices were taken
   from a bench-scale horizontal-flow anaerobic immobilized sludge (HAIS)
   reactor treating kraft paper industry wastewater submitted to eight
   different water flow rates in a 10 mi tube segment for cell wash-out
   evaluation and six different glucose solution flow rates in a 10 mi

   only 9\% of volatile suspended solids were washed-out from polyurethane
   foam matrices when they were subjected to liquid superficial velocities
   ranging from 0.30 to 2.21 cm.s(-1). The external mass transfer

Abstract = {{A model of the formation of linear higher fatty acids from glucose in
   the acidogenic phase of anaerobic digestion process is presented. It is
   an extension of the original Mosey model. It can be extended for
   even-carbon acids generally, while for odd-carbon acids it can be done
   with some restriction. This is due to the coupling between pathways for
   odd- and even-carbon acid formation. Higher acid formation occurs in the
   middle range of hydrogen concentrations. The changes in hydrogen

Abstract = {{Different strategies designed to increase the removal of Pb were tested
   during the application of a biological remediation procedure to treat
   highly-contaminated aquatic sediments. The use of FeCl2 instead of FeSO4
   . 7H(2)O as a substrate for thiobacilli bacteria did not interfere with
   the biological solubilization process which occurred in sediments
   acidified to pH 4 with H2SO4 With FeCl2, twice as much Pb was
   solubilized (5 mg Pb l(-1)) compared to the same strain acclimated to
   FeSO4 . 7H(2)O. With FeCl2, the solubilization of other trace metals
   (Cu,Zn) was similar to that obtained with the strain acclimated to FeSO4
   . 7H(2)O. If the sediments were acidified with HCl, rather than H2SO4,
   then the solubilization of Pb increased to 11 mg Pb l(-1): this was five
   times greater than when a strain acclimated to FeSO4 . 7H(2)O was used
   in sediments acidified with H2SO4 Theoretical calculations with
   MINEQL(+) (chemical equilibrium program) predicted 10.8 mg Pb l(-1)
   under similar conditions. This biological solubilization process was
   generally poorly adaptable to changes in the source of acidity (i.e. HCl
   vs H2SO4) The solubilization of Cu remained relatively low
   (solubilization of only 35\% after 72 h) since the inadequately low
   levels of sulphate prevented the Thiobacillus bacteria from properly
   developing. Finally, the higher concentration of chloride ions gained
   through an increased level of total solids (7\% rather than 3\% TS) did
   not increase the soluble concentration of Pb. The soluble concentration
   of Pb remained at 11 mg Pb l(-1) (46\%), whereas theory predicted a
   concentration of 24.1 (100\%) mg Pb l(-1). Most of the experimental
   results seemed to follow the theoretically predicted outcome for Pb
   solubilization. There is more work to do to optimize the process.
   However, this work reveals that it seems possible to develop an
   economical process for the removal of Pb from contaminated sediments.

Abstract = {{Biodegradation of Marlipal 1618/25 (Marlipal) under the river water
   die-away test was studied. Marlipal was a representative surfactant of
   the group of oxyethylated alcohols. The Warta River (Poznan) water,
   containing no additional organic nutrients, was used as inoculum. The
   indirect tensammetric method (ITM) was used for the measurement of total
   concentration of non-ionic surfactants (NS), i.e. for primary
   biodegradation control and the adsorptive stripping tensammetry (AdST)
   as a supplementary technique. The manometric respirometry method (MRM)
   measuring the total biodegradation was used as comparative method.
   Marlipal was completely degraded within the period of 5-10 days,
   depending on the surfactant spike, but in two distinctly separated
   stages, evidenced both by the ITM and AdST. The time of both steps was
   dependent on the spike of Marlipal: with the higher spike the steps
   appeared later. The results of MRM differed from the results of the ITM
   within the initial period of the experiment. The MRM showed distinct
   biodegradation within this period while the total concentration of NS,
   as measured by the ITM, was equal to the initial value, showing lack of
   biodegradation of Marlipal. The biodegradation of the river water
   organic matter induced by the spike of surfactant, at sufficiently high
   concentration can be the explanation of this effect. High sensitivity of
   the ITM enabled to measure the biodegradation of `'native' NS of the
   river water in non-spiked samples. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Various chemical approaches were used to characterize P and Si in the
   surface sediment of Lake Vesijarvi, Southern Finland. The dynamic
   equilibrium between solid and solution P in aerobic and anaerobic
   sediment was investigated by means of desorption-sorption isotherms. The
   sediment material was rich in hydrated Al and Fe oxides and,
   accordingly, had a high P sorption capacity and a very low P
   concentration (5 mu g l(-1)) in the interstitial water under aerobic
   conditions. Approximately 25-30\% of total P and almost 90\% of total Si
   were bound in mineral lattices, i.e. in a stable form not participating
   in biological and chemical transformations. Organic P comprised about
   20-25\% of total P and was mainly in practically insoluble form not
   extractable by dilute base or acid. Phosphorus participating in
   sorption-desorption reactions was considered to originate from reserves
   bound on oxide surfaces. When the oxide bound P reserves were determined
   by fractionation analysis, a large amount of Si (corresponding to about
   30\% of biogenic reserves) was also dissolved. Anaerobiosis increased
   distinctly the occurrence of both elements in the interstitial water.
   These dissolution patterns suggest that P and Si are bound to the same
   components and, therefore, compete with each other for the sorption
   sites. This chemical competition, in turn, may be of importance in the
   nutrient exchange between solid and solution phase in sediment.

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study was to develop a test system for
   clustering and characterizing the functions of the bacterial populations
   in wastewater infiltration systems. To create different bacterial
   ecosystems, sand-filter columns were loaded with a low loading (2.9 +/-
   0.1 cm d(-1)) and a high loading (8.7 +/- 0.2 cm d(-1)) of an artificial
   wastewater for 114 days. Before loading onto the columns the wastewater
   was pretreated in a three-chambered container for 24 h. The low loaded
   filters attained a high and steady rate of mineralization and complete
   nitrification, whereas the high loaded filters developed a clogging
   surface, and incomplete nitrification despite a high rate of
   mineralization. On day 60 the sand surface was sampled, and the bacteria
   were extracted and enumdrated. From each column system 88 bacterial
   isolates were collected. Each isolate was subjected to 51 physiological
   and biochemical tests. The results were analyzed using the SIMCA
   statistical package. Using partial least-square regression discriminant
   analysis we developed a model that revealed five major clusters of
   bacteria among the 176 isolates. Two clusters consisted of bacteria from
   the high loaded filters, and another two clusters consisted of bacteria
   from the low loaded filters. The fifth cluster represented a mixed
   population containing members from both loading levels. The results were
   used to characterize the bacterial populations, and a hypothesis as to
   how these populations developed in their respective system was proposed.
   The model could be used for classifying the bacterial isolates into low
   or high loaded system. Only six isolates from each loading level were
   misclassified. The model was stable as indicated by the fact that both
   the numbers of tests and the numbers of isolates entered in the model
   could be reduced without any significant loss of information. Copyright

Abstract = {{An adsorbent for heavy metal was synthesized by introducing
   polyethyleneimine (PEI) into porous cellulose carriers. Evaluations of
   synthesis results and adsorbent properties were conducted. Elementary
   analysis of the adsorbent revealed extensive crosslinking of PEI with
   the modified matrix. Batch adsorption tests showed the ability of
   cell-PEI to selectively remove mercury even at acidic regions. At low
   concentration ranges, mercury adsorption by cell-PEI can be interpreted
   by the Langmuir isotherm. With this model, an adsorbent capacity and
   Hg-ligand stability constant of approximately 288.0 mg g(-1) and 12.9 l
   mg(-1), respectively, were obtained. From adsorption rate experiments,
   diffusivity of Hg in the carrier was found to be approximately equal to
   7.30 x 10(-14) m(2) s(-1). Extensive crosslinking of PEI chains that
   restricts ligand mobility was cited as the foremost factor contributing
   to these observed properties. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{The interactions between organic matter, bacterial biomass, enzyme
   activities and environmental factors were studied during bank filtration
   of humus-rich lake water. The exoenzymatic beta-glucosidase, phosphatase
   and alanine-aminopeptidase activities in water were measured in vitro as
   release of fluorescing degradation products from methylumbelliferyl
   substrates. The total enzymatic decomposition activity was mesured as
   the hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate (FDA). Bacterial enzymatic
   activities decreased strongly after infiltration of lake water. The
   decrease in the enzyme activities correlated with decrease in bacterial
   counts and biomass production. However, the increase in specific
   FDA-hydrolysis activity (activity per bacterial cell) indicated that
   maintenance energy requirements increased during filtration in the
   ground. There was also an increase in the specific phosphatase activity,
   which might be associated with the decrease in the concentration of
   available phosphate. All enzyme activities depended on seasonal
   temperature changes. The highest FDA-hydrolysis, phosphatase and
   beta-glucosidase activities occurred during the summer months, when the
   bacterial production activity and the demand of essential nutrients were
   highest. On the contrary, the alanine-aminopeptidase activity was
   highest during autumn and winter, probably as a result of infiltrated
   nitrogenous material from senescing and dying microbes and algae in lake
   water. The close correlations between enzymatic activities and other
   microbial parameters suggest that enzyme activities can be used to
   monitor the changes in microbiological quality of water during bank
   filtration of lake water. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{A significant consideration in forward planning for water treatment
   works design and operation concerns the effectiveness of a filtration
   plant in providing a barrier to particulates in the low micrometre size
   range, including Cryptosporidium oocysts. The performance of rapid
   gravity filtration plants is believed to be dependent on backwash and
   start-up regimes. It was the aim of this study to optimize direct sand
   filtration by identifying optimum filter backwash and start-up
   conditions which minimized the passage of particulates into the
   filtrate. The filter ripening period has long been identified as a cause
   for concern with respect to particulate passage into the filtrate; this
   work has shown that up to 40\% of all particles that pass into supply
   during a 48 h run, do so in the first hour of operation. Optimum
   combined air water `'collapse-pulsing'' backwash durations were
   identified that reduced the number of 2-5 mu m particles entering the
   filtrate, especially during the ripening period. Slow start-up was also
   found to reduce the number of 2-5 mu m particles in the filtrate during
   the ripening period. The reductions in particulate passage resulting
   from a slow start was found to be media dependent, with smaller media
   requiring a longer slow start duration than coarser media. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Geosmin (1 alpha,10 beta-dimethyl-9 alpha-decanol) and

   ((1-R-exo)-1,2,7,7-tetramethyl-bicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptan-2-ol) (MIB) are
   volatile terpene derivatives, and have received a great deal of
   attention because they can cause musty/muddy off-flavor in water and
   food resources. By the Ames test, these metabolites showed no
   mutagenicity but antimicrobial activity toward tester strains. While
   these compounds are produced by various organisms living in aquatic
   environments, there are few reports of their effects on aquatic
   organisms. The effects of geosmin and MIB on sea urchin development were
   examined. The estimated IC50 (50\% inhibitory concentration) values for
   the formation of the fertilization membrane were 16.67 mg geosmin l(-1)
   and 68.77 mg MIB l(-1); those for the cell cleavage were 16.58 mg
   geosmin l(-1) and 66.86 mg MIB l(-1), suggesting that the toxicity of
   geosmin and MIB toward sea urchins are comparable to their toxicity
   toward Salmonella tester strains in the Ames test. These values are far
   greater than concentrations of these substances observed in aquatic
   environments with severe muddy off-flavor problems. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{Ship traffic in freshwater rivers may impact water quality by
   resuspending contaminated bottom sediment. Water samples were analyzed
   from two different depths at three sites across a transect of the
   Buffalo River, NY, before and after passage of a lake-going ship.
   Samples From all sites were analyzed for fecal coliform (FC),
   heterotrophic plate count (HPC), and total suspended solids (TSS). The
   levels of all test parameters increased immediately after the ship
   passed with the largest increases observed at mid-channel sites.
   Epifluorescent direct counts of mid-channel samples showed that the
   bacteria in the water column increased significantly (p < 0.001) at both
   1 and 4 m below the surface and were positively correlated with TSS (r =
   0.84). Particle size distribution in the upper water column was
   determined by automated image analysis. The median particle size class,
   by volume, before and after the ship passed was 48.9-56.6 mu m and
   366.5-391 mu m, respectively. A few large flocculated particles
   accounted for most of the volume of the resuspended sediment.
   Resuspension of flocculated, bacteria-laden particles affects bacterial
   transport dynamics in riverine systems. The characteristics of
   flocculated sediments in suspension therefore should be considered in
   water quality modeling. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Microorganisms that rapidly proliferated as brown granules and attached
   to the walls of a storage vessel in a municipal plant for water
   purification were cultured in the laboratory. From the cultured broth a
   distinctly offensive odor was detected and filamentous organisms were
   found predominant. The objectives of this work were to isolate and
   identify the odor-producing microorganisms and analyze the odorous
   compounds. An actinomycete, which was not responsible for the production
   of odor, was found to coexist with the target bacterium, the
   cyanobacterium. However, a pure culture of cyanobacterium could not be
   obtained despite a series of purifications. According to morphological
   characteristics, the cyanobacterium was identified as Nostoc sp. With
   closed-loop stripping analysis (CLSA), trace organics of odorous
   compound produced by the isolate were detected at nanogram-per-liter
   levels. In a batch system, geosmin and MIB showed the highest
   concentration when cells were in the declining phase. Nostoc sp. was
   never reported to produce geosmin and MIB. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A yeast reactor was proposed to treat highly concentrated acidified
   effluents of the food industry. The strain Candida utilis was selected
   and operated in batch or continuously in a perfectly mixed reactor with
   acetic acid, propionic acid or butyric acid as the sole carbon source
   while the pH was maintained at 3.5 to prevent most bacterial
   contamination. The obtained 97\% TOC abatement through the continuous
   reactor was independent of inlet concentration and space-time if the
   space-time is higher than a critical wash-out value. Such large loading
   rates as 30 kg TOC/m(3) . day could be treated. The reaction rate was
   inhibited by the substrate concentration which explained a steady outlet
   TOC concentration when the reactor was operated under the critical
   space-time value. The sludge production was of the same order of
   magnitude as in a conventional activated sludge reactor. The solids were
   easily flocculated and settled after neutralizing the suspension.

Abstract = {{Monoethylamine (MEA) degradation via nitrate respiration was evaluated
   in batch experiments using suspended growth bacterial cultures grown
   under low growth rate conditions. It was found that, under the
   conditions tested, MEA was highly degradable when the initial TOC/MLVSS
   ratio used in a batch experiment was <0.35, beyond which, however, MEA
   inhibition was evident. The composition of the medium solution used to
   cultivate the bacterial cultures was critical in MEA degradation via
   nitrate respiration. In this study, the best MEA degradation was
   attained when cobalt (0.45 mg/l), copper (0.5 mg/l), molybdenum (0.5
   mg/l), and yeast extract (1.0 mg/l) were all present in the medium
   solution. Ammonia was formed as an end product from MEA degradation via
   nitrate respiration. The MEA-N initially added in a batch experiment
   could be accounted for as NH4+-N when the assimilatory requirements for
   nitrogen were negligible during the sampling period. Copyright (C) 1996

   publications from 1970 to early 1995 is presented. Sections of the

   indicators of water quality, the spatial distribution of sampling sites,
   sampling frequency, computer-aided methodologies and the
   cost-effectiveness of designs. Groundwater monitoring is reviewed in a
   separate section. A summary provides comments on the present state of
   aquatic monitoring practice, and delineates areas of research which the
   authors believe require both immediate and long-term consideration.

Abstract = {{The destruction of pentachlorophenol (PCP), oxalic acid, chlorendic
   acid, and a mixture of pentachlorophenol, 1,3-dichlorobenzene (DCB), and
   trichloroethylene (TCE) were studied using a two-phase ozonation system.
   A two-phase ozonation system consists of water containing the pollutant
   and a second solvent phase which houses the ozone. The solvent phase is
   an inert fluorinated hydrocarbon (FC40) that is nonpolar and reusable.
   The solvent phase is desirable because it has a high ozone stability (k
   = 0.0033 min(-1)) and an ozone solubility of 120 mg/L at 25 degrees C,
   10 times that of water. In addition to an enhanced oxidation rate of
   PCP, less ozone was utilized. At high pH (10.3), a first-order rate
   constant of 200 min(-1) in the two-phase system was found for PCP
   degradation compared to k(app) = 0.154 min(-1) in a single aqueous-phase
   system. Within 15 s, the concentration of PCP (100 mg/L initially) was
   degraded more than 90\%, and 100\% dechlorination was obtained with
   longer reaction times. This system also demonstrated the ability to
   selectively oxidize PCP while in the presence of free radical scavengers
   existing in the water phase. PCP was also successfully oxidized using
   actual wastewater which contained alkalinity, hardness, many inorganics,
   and trace hazardous organics. Oxalic acid, an intermediate formed during
   the degradation of PCP, was also degraded by two-phase ozonation.
   Preliminary work with chlorendic acid showed that two-phase ozonation
   was faster than single aqueous-phase ozonation at dechlorinating the
   compound. TCE and DCB degraded slightly faster when PCP was added to the
   mixture, possibly due to the production of other radicals during the
   oxidation of PCP. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Reverse osmosis (RO) and physical/chemical technology were evaluated for
   treatment of neutralized spent acid effluent (seepage) containing high
   concentration levels of TDS (7500 mg/l), Ca (400 mg/l), Cr-VI (42 mg/l),
   nitrate-nitrogen (827 mg/l), ammonia-nitrogen (33 mg/l), fluoride (13
   mg/l), phenolics (45 mg/l) and COD (620 mg/l). The calcium concentration
   level in the seepage could be reduced from approximately 400 to 5 mg/l
   with soda ash softening. Initial permeate flux (feed and bleed system,
   85\% water recovery) was 278 1/m(2) . d. Permeate flux, however, dropped
   rapidly in the beginning of the run and then remained approximately
   constant to the end of the run. However, chemical cleaning of the
   membranes was necessary to maintain flux. The TDS of the RO feed could
   be reduced in one case from 34,253 to 1560 mg/l(95.5\% removal) at 85\%
   water recovery. Nitrate and ammonia nitrogen were reduced from 2691 and
   103 mg/l to 414 (84.6\% removal) and 15 mg/l (85.3\% removal),
   respectively. Chromium(VI) and fluoride were reduced from 183 and 90
   mg/l to 0.38 (99.8\% removal) and 2.8 mg/l (96.9\% removal),
   respectively. COD removals varied between 60 and 80\%. No phenolics,
   however, could be removed from the feed (approximately 32 mg/l) with the
   cellulose acetate RO membranes. Phenolics, however, could be effectively
   removed (<0.2 mg/l) from the RO permeate with hydrogen peroxide
   oxidation or ion-exchange treatment. Preliminary test work has shown
   that it should be possible to treat the seepage effectively with RO for
   pollution control, effluent volume reduction and water recovery. Capital
   costs for a 600 kl/d plant for lime softening, RO and oxidation
   equipment are estimated at U.S. 558,000, U.S. \$350,000 and U.S.

Abstract = {{Biosorption of copper(II) by the untreated and acid-treated fungal
   biomass has been studied in both batch and column modes. Two species,
   Aspergillus oryzae and Rhizopus oryzae, were used in this study. A.
   oryzae mycelia (undergoing acid-washing) exhibit a clear advantage in
   Cu(II) removal, compared with other adsorbents. The acid-washing process
   can strongly enhance the adsorption capacity for A. oryzae mycelia.
   However, acid-washing does not alter the metal adsorption capacity of R.
   oryzae mycelia. The result indicates that acid-washing is not only a
   pretreatment step but also a regeneration step in the heavy metal
   removal process. These dual purposes, therefore, give the acid-washing
   biomass an indication of successful prospect.
   Cultivating A. oryzae in pellet form is an effective means of mycelium
   immobilization. The method established in this study provides the
   high-yield, uniformly-sized particles (2-3 mm in diameter), which are
   effective in solid-liquid separation. This pellet column can completely
   remove metals before breakpoint. After the breakpoint, a significant
   amount of Cu(II) removal over a long period has been observed. This is
   thought to be the result of intracellular uptake. Copyright (C) 1996

Title = {{Dynamic modelling of bacterial growth in drinking water networks}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Numerous biological and physicochemical reactions take place in drinking
   water distribution systems, and give rise to phenomena whereby the
   organoleptic or bacteriological characteristics of the distributed water
   are modified. Drinking water may contain residual biodegradable
   dissolved organic compounds which provide a primary source for the
   formation of a trophic chain inside the pipes. Bacterial biomasses
   develop mainly on the internal surface of the pipes, where they are
   relatively well protected from the action of chlorination agents. The
   detachment of these biomasses is responsible for most of the bacterial
   proliferation observed in water samples taken in distribution systems,
   and also contributes to the installation of undesirable metazoea such as
   Asellus aquaticus.
   Combatting these biological developments calls for the application of
   preventive and remedial treatments, and these can be studied more
   closely by the use of modelling. This article proposes a model for the
   study of the behaviour of bacterial biomasses in distribution networks,
   taking into account the various major parameters which govern their
   structure, such as the ratio of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon
   (BDOC), temperature, residual chlorine, pH and the hydraulic conditions
   of each pipe, The model makes use of the data supplied by the Piccolo
   hydraulic modelling software, which can provide predictive mapping of
   the situation of each section of the network. What is more, by taking
   into account the physiochemical and biological variations in the water
   at the intake to the network, this dynamic model forecasts the evolution
   of the variables depending on residence time but also on time, thus
   enabling better visualisation of a disruption in the system in real
   time. We discuss the influence of the expression of the detachment of
   fixed bacteria on solutions of the system of differential equations. Use
   of the model reveals threshold values of temperature and BDOC which can
   enable a natural limitation of bacterial biomasses in the network
   without the use of chlorine. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Water contamination in Lake Taihu and Lake Wulihu poses a threat to
   water supply and recreation. Water samples were collected during
   1988-1989 for analysis of organic contaminants in the two lakes. Over
   800 organic contaminants were detected by GC and CC-MS, and 84 of them
   were screened by a scoring system as priority contaminants. Results
   showed that the average concentration was one order of magnitude higher
   in Lake Wulihu than in Lake Taihu, although the number of contaminants
   in Lake Wulihu was only double those in Lake Taihu. Concentrations of
   phthalates, halohydrocarbons, and alkanes in Lake Taihu were close to
   those in Lake Wulihu, whereas the concentrations of alkylaromatics,
   anilines, phenols, alcohols, ketones, and polynuclear aromatics in Lake
   Taihu were lower than in Lake Wulihu by 2-3 orders of magnitude. The
   average concentration of contaminants in Lake Taihu reaches the highest
   during the rainy season while this occurs in Lake Wulihu during the dry
   season because of differences in water Row patterns in the lakes,
   conditions of the water environment, and physico-chemical properties of
   contaminants. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1996}},

Pages = {{2009-2016}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The present study consists of assessing the efficiency of a macrophyte
   (Phragmites australis) system in wastewater purification in an arid
   climate. The experimental system is made up of three beds differing in
   length (30, 40 and 50 m) and implanted with Phragmites australis.
   Wastewater inflow through these beds is horizontal with a flow of 10
   I.s(-1). Retention time varies between 1 and 4 h. The frequency of
   irrigation is weekly. The studied parameters are: the organic load (GOD
   and TSS), nutrients (total Kjeldhal nitrogen: TKN and total phosphorus:
   TP) and the parasitical load (helminth eggs). Water, soil and plants are
   the three components of the experimental system we analyzed.
   Results reveal that in the output, the decrease in organic load,
   nutrients and parasitical load is very sharp in the large bed (GOD:
   62\%, TKN: 43\%, TP: 14\%, helminth eggs: 93\%). However, in the small
   bed (30 m), the decrease is slight (GOD: 48\%, TKN: 23\%, TP: 5\%,
   helminth eggs: 88\%). Concerning parasitical load, the study shows that
   the three beds are effective in eliminating helminth eggs, even with a
   very short retention time (1-4 h). The quality of the effluent of the
   reed bed system should be classified within category B according to WHO
   guidelines (1989) for crops irrigation.
   Soil sample analysis from entrance to exit shows a decreasing gradient
   of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), organic carbon (Org.C), organic matter
   (OM) and parasitical helminth eggs. The gradient becomes more
   significant in the largest bed with decreasing rate, reaching
   respectively 49\%, 44\%, 37\%, 40\% and 100\% for TKN, TP, Org.C, OM and
   helminth eggs.
   As for the plant material, the composition of major elements (nitrogen
   and phosphorus) of Phragmites aerial parts shows the same evolution.
   While the decreasing rate of nitrogen in the leaves reaches 50\% in the
   largest bed, it does not exceed 8\% in the smallest bed. Mean aerial
   productivity of the studied reed beds was estimated at 134 tons dry
   weight.ha(-1). The aerial biomass exported contains only 5-6\% of
   nitrogen and 10-12\% of phosphorus with regard to their load at the
   influent. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

   districts. The other common water-quality parameters, as well as total
   organic carbon and halogens, oils and greases of general use, and 34
   inorganic elements were within the standard norms for safe drinking
   water. Chromium and, to a lesser extent, lead and mercury could become a
   threat to health if the situation worsens. Although thorough
   hydrogeological studies are needed to determine contaminant pathways,
   insufficient well maintenance appears to be the main factor contributing
   to the bacteriological contamination, while the nitrate contamination
   seems more closely linked to infiltration of organic contaminants from
   the soil surface. Piped city water was found to comply with WHO norms
   for drinking water and its use should be strongly encouraged to reduce
   the incidence of water-borne diseases. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A process is proposed to use dissolved humic substances (DHS) which
   through hydrophobic binding reduce sorbability of organic contaminants
   and enhance desorption-remediation of contaminated sites. Computations,
   using sorption-desorption and binding models, predict 50- to 100-fold
   reductions in sorbability and retardation of highly hydrophobic organic
   solutes (log K-ow greater than or equal to 6) using DHS solutions of
   20-50 mg/1. Solutes of medium hydrophobicity (log K-ow 4-5) would
   require 100-200 mg/1 of DHS for 90\% reduction in retardation, while low
   hydrophobic solutes (log K-ow < 3) are little affected. The high
   reduction in retardation results in a corresponding reduction in volumes
   of flushing liquid and process times, as well as in higher concentration
   of the released contaminant facilitating treatment and disposal. The
   paper includes regression correlations between binding coefficients to
   aqueous DHS Kb and K, of many solutes and a sensitivity analysis to
   model parameters. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{This study examined water and sediment samples for a range of indicator
   and pathogenic microorganisms from six sites in an urban estuary,
   Sydney, Australia. Water quality was affected by rainfall and sewage
   overflows which were associated with significant increases in the
   concentration of faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci, Clostridium
   perfringens spores, F-RNA bacteriophage, Aeromonas spp., Giardia and
   Cryptosporidium spp. However, in sediments, only faecal coliform
   concentrations were significantly increased by rainfall, although sewage
   overflow again resulted in increased concentrations of faecal coliforms,
   faecal streptococci, C. perfringens spores and Aeromonas. Isolation of
   Salmonella appeared to coincide with wet weather events and occasionally
   identical serotypes were detected in sediments at several locations
   within the estuary. However, isolations of enteric virus were sporadic
   and did not appear to be exclusively related to wet weather events. C.
   perfringens was identified as the most useful indicator of faecal
   pollution and was the only indicator significantly correlated to the
   presence of pathogenic Giardia (r = 0.41, p < 0.05) and the
   opportunistic bacterial genus Aeromonas (r = 0.39, p < 0.05). F-RNA
   bacteriophage was not significantly correlated with any of the pathogens

Abstract = {{Experimental studies were conducted to assess the continuous culture
   biodegradation of s-triazines which originate from the chemical
   oxidation of simazine. Simazine is a herbicide found widely in surface
   and groundwaters. The four s-triazines selected for study, didealkyl
   atrazine (CAAT), ammeline (OAAT), ammelide (OOAT), and cyanuric acid
   (OOOT), originate from the ozone/UV oxidation of simazine. Decreases in
   continuous culture net growth rate, decreases in C:s-triazine-N feed
   ratio, and increases in inorganic nitrogen either through addition to
   the feed or by nitrogen fixation resulted in poorer s-triazine removal.
   For each process variable studied, the reduction in removal efficiency
   was s-triazine specific. In general, the greatest reductions in removal
   efficiency was observed for CAAT followed by OAAT, GOAT, and OOOT
   indicating that the s-triazine ring substituent group is an important
   factor in determining its effectiveness as a nitrogen source for
   microbial metabolism. The relationship between ring substituent and

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates that short-term changes in flow velocity affect
   nitrogenous compounds' transport and conversion in a shallow,
   slow-flowing channel. Two different flow conditions controlled by varied
   how velocities, including laminar and turbulent flow, are proposed to
   describe soluble and particulate nitrogenous compounds transported
   between the water column and biofilms. The incipient turbulent flow was
   suggested to design a flowing channel which will induce a high rate of
   nitrification and a low rate of resuspension. A series of
   well-controlled batch tests were carried out to investigate nitrogenous
   compound transformations in an artificial channel at varied flow
   velocities. The results of the batch tests show that a particular type
   of water motion will control the fate of nitrogen, while organic matter
   concentration is low in the water column. When laminar flow occurs in
   the flowing channel, total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) removal rate is held
   approximately constant; oxidized nitrogen generation rate increased when
   how velocity increased; nitrate and ammonium nitrogen converted slowly;
   organic nitrogen and total nitrogen concentration gradually decreased
   with the test time. In contrast, when the flow condition transferred
   from laminar dow to turbulent flow, the TKN removal rate decreased when
   flow velocity increased; the oxidized nitrogen generation rate increased
   more than it did during the laminar flow, and it maintained a constant
   rate when flow velocity became higher; nitrate concentration increased
   and ammonium nitrogen concentration decreased quickly; total nitrogen
   and organic nitrogen concentration gradually decreased and later
   increased. The primary pathways of nitrogenous compounds' conversion and
   transport can be recognized when organic substance concentrations and
   flow conditions are known. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{In a long-term study, the process of biological sulfate reduction in
   anaerobic two-stage pilot plants treating tannery wastewater was
   investigated with the objective to reduce most of the sulfate in the
   first stage. Influence of quality and quantity of wastewater on sulfate
   removal in both stages of the pilot plant was tested simultaneously
   (multiple regression). Origin of the wastewater; chromium, chloride,
   sulfide and COD in the influent showed no significant effect on
   desulfurization. Feed Row and the concentration of sulfate in the
   influent, however, significantly affected sulfate removal. In the first
   stage, desulfurization increased with higher feed Row but the
   desulfurization then decreased in the second stage. The concentration of
   sulfate in the influent had a significant influence on the
   desulfurization in both stages of the pilot plants. The removal of
   sulfate in the first stage was approximately 30\%, whereas in the second
   stage the desulfurization decreased with higher concentrations of
   sulfate in the influent.
   Operational parameters were adjusted in order to restrict the biological
   sulfate reduction to the first stage. The statistical method employed
   was analysis of variance. Compared to pH 5 or 6 in the influent, a pH of
   7 most increased biological sulfate reduction in the first stage. No
   significant influence on COD removal or volume of gas were observed. For
   three pilot plants operated parallel to each other, no significant
   difference in desulfurization was noticed. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{PACT (Powdered Activated Carbon Treatment) process was developed for the
   treatment of wastewater containing compounds which are difficult to
   oxidize. Enhancement properties of activated carbon added to activated
   sludge units are well known but not justified. In this work the process
   has been applied in lab plant for the treatment of a synthetic textile
   wastewater with an azodye used in the wool textile industry (Acid Orange
   7, C.I. 15510). Microorganism growth on a carbon surface is only reached
   at low values of biomass concentration (low sludge age), and then a high
   percentage of dye removal is obtained (97.0 +/- 1.6\%). The influence of
   biomass concentration on COD and dye removal is discussed because this
   variable is essential especially in dye removal. The carbon surface is
   visualized by microscope techniques and it is shown that a strong
   dependence exists between pollutant removal and biomass concentration.

Abstract = {{The policies and procedures adopted by the Biological Monitoring Working
   Party in developing its score system are summarised. The conceptual
   basis of the reappraisal is described and then formulated
   mathematically. The analysis is based on some 17,000 biological samples
   and covers 85 families. The results are expressed in terms of derived
   scores which mirror the scores allocated to the families by the BMWP.
   Some of the differences between the derived and original scores are
   quite substantial, and are shown to relate to policies and practices
   adopted by the Working Party. It is argued that the derived scores offer
   a more realistic representation of the families' sensitivities to
   pollution than do the BMWP scores. The most significant differences are
   discussed in relation to their likely causes and are shown to be
   consistent with expectations. It is concluded that the system's poor
   performance in some recent tests may be explained by these findings, and
   that corrective action could improve performance. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{Electrofishing, multiplate invertebrate samplers, and periphytometers
   were used to collect biological samples from 10 sites in two
   southeastern coastal plain streams. The objectives were to evaluate two
   factors that affect the quality of biomonitoring data: inter-replicate
   variability and sensitivity to habitat effects that could be confounded
   with environmental impacts. Abundance related estimates (density,
   catch-per-unit-effort, biomass, chlorophyll a) exhibited high
   inter-replicate variability necessitating the collection of large
   numbers of samples (25) to detect small (40\%) differences among sites.
   Species number estimates exhibited much lower inter-replicate
   variability and sample number requirements (6 samples to detect a 40\%
   difference). Electrofishing generally required fewer samples and less
   time than the other methods to obtain comparable levels of precision.
   Species composition and abundance estimates produced by all methods were
   affected by longitudinal changes in habitat that caused differences
   between control and impact sites that could be mistaken for impacts.
   Biomonitoring programs can be improved by assessing the relationship
   between statistical power and replicate number, collecting as many
   replicates as is feasible, collecting pre-impact and post-impact data
   when possible, matching control and impact sites on habitat, comparing
   the ecological characteristics (e.g. pollution tolerance) of organisms
   at control and impact sites, and using comparisons based on species
   number rather than abundance. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Thiuram (Bis(dimethyldithiocarbamoyl) disulfide), a kind of
   disinfectant, affected growth and induced lethality as a chemical
   stressor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Examining the protein profiles by
   SDS-PAGE and western blotting analysis, yeast cells which were incubated
   with thiuram for 90 min at 30 degrees C induced a number of proteins
   including hsp104, hsp90 and hsp70 according to the concentrations. Using
   the Delta hsp104 and its parent strain, thermotolerance with the prior
   10 mg/l thiuram treatment in the parent strain was greater than that in
   the control at 20 min, but that in the Delta hsp104 strain was almost
   the same as the control over the long term. Trehalose was not
   accumulated by thiuram. Thus, it follows that hsp104, which is typically
   induced by moderate heat-shock treatment, is mostly induced in the
   presence of thiuram also. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional model of activated sludge secondary clarifiers with a
   dispersion term dependent on concentration and feed velocity was
   developed. Motivation for this model was derived from an analysis of a
   model employing a constraint on the gravity flux which has been shown to
   give excellent fits to a previously published data set. It was noted
   that the gravity flux constraint disappears as the level of
   discretization is increased, a difficulty which our model overcomes.
   Data collected from a full-scale clarifier at the Kanapaha Water
   Reclamation Facility were used to evaluate our model. Better matches to
   observed concentration profiles were achieved with our model than with
   the gravity-flux-constraining model. In addition, our model, when
   calibrated using data from experiments in which the sludge blanket
   reached steady levels, successfully predicted the outcomes of five
   experiments which exhibited continuously rising blankets. These failures
   to reach steady blanket levels were not predicted by either limiting
   total solids flux theory or the gravity-flux-constraining model.

Abstract = {{Several compounds exist which are responsible for unwanted taste and
   odor characteristics that have been found in the edible tissue of the
   channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). Methylisoborneol (MIB), one
   compound responsible for these off-flavors, is produced through the
   metabolism of cyanobacteria in aqueous systems such as reservoirs and
   ponds. The channel catfish accumulates MIB in its tissues from the
   intake of its culture-pond water. Current methods of analysis for MIB,
   such as closed- and open-loop stripping, and liquid-liquid extraction,
   are time-consuming and labor-intensive. A method for the analysis of MIB
   in catfish culture-pond water is described which, unlike other methods,
   is rapid, inexpensive, and does not require specialized sample
   preparation equipment. This method utilizes C-18 solid-phase extraction
   followed by capillary gas chromatography with detection by mass
   spectrometry. Standard MIB and the internal standard, butylisoborneol
   (BIB), were prepared from the reaction of D-camphor with methylmagnesium
   chloride and n-butyllithium, respectively. Extraction efficiencies for
   MIB in channel catfish pond water averaged 89\% at 101 parts per
   trillion (ppt) and 84\% at 202 parts per billion (ppb). The detection
   limit of the method was calculated to be 11.5 ppt. Copyright (C) 1996

Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{In vivo C-13-NMR and P-31-NMR techniques were applied to study
   phosphorus and carbon metabolism in activated sludge during both the
   anaerobic and the aerobic stages. By supplying a C-13 label on the
   methyl group of acetate at the beginning of the anaerobic stage, the
   fate of the label through the subsequent aerobic/anaerobic stages was
   traced in vivo, it was possible to follow the Aux of label from acetate
   to hydroxybutyrate/hydroxyvalerate co-polymer in the first anaerobic
   stage, then to monitor the conversion of these units into glycogen in a
   subsequent aerobic stage, and afterwards, by submitting the same sludge
   to a second anaerobic stage, to observe the flux of labelled carbon from
   glycogen to the hydroxyvalerate and hydroxybutyrate units. The
   uptake/release of inorganic phosphate and the extracellular pH were
   monitored by P-31-NMR in the same experiments. The data provide an
   unequivocal demonstration of the involvement of glycogen in the
   biological phosphorus removal process. On the basis of these C-13
   labelling data, a biochemical model for the synthesis of
   polyhydroxyalkanoates from acetate and glycogen was elaborated in which
   the tricarboxylic acid cycle is proposed as an additional source of
   reduction equivalents. According to this study, from 1 C-mol acetate,
   1.48 C-mol P(HB/HV) are synthesized and 0.70 C-mol glycogen are degraded
   anaerobically, while 0.16 P-moi phosphate is released. In the aerobic
   stage, 1 C-mol of P(HB/HV) is converted to 0.44 C-mol glycogen.

Abstract = {{Seasonal and long-term trends in the rate of calcium carbonate (CaCO3)
   deposition are documented for Ca2+ polluted Onondaga Lake, New York.
   These observations are based on particulate inorganic carbon and
   particulate calcium analyses of sediment trap collections, made weekly
   over the May-September interval for 10 years. Continuous deposition of
   CaCO3 was evident for the monitoring period of all 10 years. The average
   rate of CaCO3 deposition for the deployment interval decreased from
   about 0.196 to 0.082 mol . m(-2). d(-1) following the closure of the
   industrial source of Ca2+ pollution. This decline was generally
   consistent with the reductions in Ca2+ loading and lake Ca2+
   concentrations over the same period. The prevailing rate of CaCO3
   deposition in Onondaga Lake remains substantially higher than the rates
   documented for three other hardwater lakes in the literature. Calcium
   carbonate is the primary component and principal regulator of the
   dynamics of total solids deposition in the lake. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{Adsorption of cadmium and sulfate in a mixed Fe(OH)(3)/SiO2 system was
   studied using the triple-layer model. The uptake of H4SiO4 dissolved
   from the SiO2 particles was considered in modeling the cation and anion
   adsorption. The mixed oxides were formed with a range of Fe(OH)(3):SiO2
   ratios by controling the precipitation of ferric hydroxide in a
   suspension of fumed silica (Cab-O-Sil). Observation of the
   micromorphology of the mixed oxides by transmission electron microscopy
   showed that Fe(OH)(3) formed separately from the SiO2 particles,
   therefore, an independent oxide model was used to simulate cation and
   anion adsorption. In this model Cd adsorption occurred on separate
   Fe(OH)(3) and SiO2 surfaces, When the pH was lower than 8, Fe(OH)(3)
   dominated Cd adsorption in the mixed system. Sulfate adsorption on the
   independent Fe(OH)(3) surface was modeled for the mixed oxide system
   because no sulfate was adsorbed by the SiO2 surface at pH > 4. The
   uptake of H4SiO4 reduced sulfate adsorption, but it had a negligible
   effect on cadmium absorption due to a combination of sorbate competition
   and electrostatic interactions. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{The formation of halogenated acetic acids in laboratory chlorinated sea
   water as well as chlorinated sea water and drinking water produced on an
   oil-installation offshore was investigated. Analyses were performed
   using solvent extraction and capillary gas chromatography with electron
   capture detection and mass spectrometry. Dichloroacetic acid,
   trichloroacetic acid, dibromoacetic acid and tribromoacetic acid were
   found in the water samples, with dibromoacetic acid present in the
   highest concentration (1-6 mu g/l). When quenching agents were applied
   to remove excessive halogen prior to extraction, significantly different
   concentrations of dibromoacetic acid were observed when samples were
   quenched with sodium thiosulfate or ammonium sulfate. Sodium thiosulfate
   quenched samples contained the lowest concentration of dibromoacetic
   acid and other unidentified products. A stability experiment showed that
   the presence of sodium thiosulfate did not affect the concentration of
   dibromoacetic acid in aqueous solutions. The increased levels of
   dibromoacetic acid in unquenched and ammonium sulfate treated samples is
   explained by an extended reaction of excessive halogen with organic
   material in the acid water samples during the time needed for
   extraction. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{The chlorate ion is one of the contaminants being considered for
   regulation in drinking water under the disinfection by-product rule. Ln
   addition to its presence in eater as a result of chlorine dioxide use,
   chlorate may be Formed during intermediate ozonation if residual
   chlorine is present. The majority of chlorate forms through a free
   radical pathway in natural source waters as opposed to by both molecular
   ozone and free radical pathways in low-DOG waters. The monitoring of OH
   radicals using p-chlorobenzoic acid indicated that the formation of
   chlorate is proportional to On radical generation. The increase in pH
   favored chlorate formation and the presence of alkalinity enhanced
   chlorate formation due to secondary reactions between carbonate radicals
   and chlorine species. The addition of ammonia and peroxide before
   ozonation reduced chlorate formation whereas the simultaneous addition
   of peroxide during ozonation enhanced chlorate formation. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{A 12-month glass-house simulation experiment has been used to
   investigate the response of drainage water solute chemistry of Calluna
   and mixed grass moorland peat microcosms to elevated deposition of
   ammonium- and nitrate-N. Uptake for both N deposition species was
   greater for grass than for Ca(luna vulgaris turfs. Nitrification was
   negligible for the elevated ammonium-N treatments, which did not
   therefore enhance nitrate leaching, but did result in substantial
   increases in ammonium leaching for both vegetation types. However, the
   elevated nitrate treatments resulted in dramatically enhanced ammonium-N
   leaching and a more modest enhancement in the leaching of organic-N. The
   biological uptake minimises the acidification effect of the enhanced N
   depositions, with ca. 70\% of the additional H+ inputs as HNO3 being
   consumed in N transformation reactions. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Physical and chemical characterization of colloids in natural waters is
   a major issue to understand the mechanism of circulation of pollutants
   in natural waters. Although many researchers are interested in colloid
   interactions, they are not yet well understood, and little is known on
   the appropriate experimental conditions needed to perform reliable and
   environmentally significant analysis. The following study is dedicated
   to the development of well-controlled analytical conditions. It is shown
   that drastic degradation of the water sample can happen during sample
   handling, if experimental conditions are inappropriate. The study also
   points out that multidisciplinary cooperation is necessary in the study
   of environmental problems. This paper is split in two parts for
   editorial reasons, The first part of this series reports experimental
   conditions, used to follow colloid stability reported in the second part

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2193-2205}},

Abstract = {{A field monitoring program was carried out on the sewage of five large
   apartment blocks in the city of Parma, Italy, to verify under realistic
   conditions existing laboratory data and model calculations on
   organohalogen formation by domestic hypochlorite (NaOCl) bleach usage.
   The average adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) level was determined for
   three distinct experimental phases: an `'undisturbed period,'' a `'no
   bleach period,'' and a `'controlled bleach usage period.'' The study
   involved participation of the site inhabitants in the second and third
   phases.
   In line with what could be predicted from the hypochlorite chemistry, an
   effect of the use of hypochlorite bleach on the AOX concentration in
   domestic sewage was detected. In a laboratory simulation conducted in
   parallel with the field study, the degree of NaOCl-to-AOX conversion
   ranged from 0.75 to 2.25\% (w/w). The degree of conversion in the field
   study itself was of the order of 1.5\% (or 0.075\% when expressed for a
   typical bleach product containing 5\% NaOCl). Under the specific
   conditions of the site, the difference in average AOX concentration in
   sewage between the `'no bleach'' and the `'undisturbed'' bleach use
   period was of the order of 37 mu g . l(-1) (P < 0.05). The average
   bleach-related AOX emission at the study site was around 7 mg
   .(inhabitant . day)(-1). Overall, these figures correspond well with
   existing literature data. Linking the measured amounts of AOX with
   available ecotoxicity data for treated domestic effluents and their
   organohalogen constituents, it can be considered unlikely that the
   organohalogens formed by domestic bleaching will exert or trigger any
   adverse environmental effect. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{A microbial biodegradability predictive model has been developed using
   groups and molecular indices as molecular descriptors. The model
   contains 12 variables. The model was calibrated and later validated with
   a data set developed from biodegradation studies of acclimated activated
   sludge metabolism. It also successfully predicted the biodegradation
   rate of several other substances with one exception within the limits
   established by a study of a second database. This fatter study was
   designed to evaluate the expected scatter in acclimated biodegradation
   rate data. The nitro group, amines, halogens and heteroatoms severely
   decrease the rate as do structural complexity and electronic alterations
   created by most substituents. The carboxyl group markedly enhances the
   rate but the hydroxyl group has little effect. It appears that the
   hydroxyl group is significant in acclimation but not in degradation. A
   discussion of statistical methods and software is included in this work.

Abstract = {{Detection of coliforms and E. call in drinking water distribution
   systems can be explained by accidental contaminations and/or growth of
   these bacteria in the network. This last point still remaining
   debatable, an experiment was carried out with two E. call strains (E.
   coli O126:B16 and one isolated from a drinking water distribution
   system) separately injected in a drinking water distribution pilot plant
   continuously fed with drinking water. The work aimed to study (i) the
   partition of the injected bacteria between the water phase and the
   indigenous biofilm phase and (ii) the kinetic of disappearance or growth
   of these bacteria.
   Depending on the strain, 1-50\% of injected bacteria adsorbed within a
   few hours to the indigenous bacterial biofilm. During the first 5-7
   days, both E. coli populations behaved similarly: the total number of
   injected bacteria decreased more quickly than the theoretical washout
   (death, lysis, predation,...). Then the number of these bacteria slowly
   increased and at day 9-12, the number of recoverable injected bacteria
   became higher than the predictable number calculated from the
   theoretical washout. This result clearly proves that both E. coli
   strains are able to grow at 20 degrees C in the absence of residual
   chlorine in a distribution network system largely colonized with an
   autochthonous population. However, colonization of the network by E.
   coli strains was only partial and transient. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Ozonation of synthetic wastewater containing: N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide
   (NMMO) was investigated in batch experiments at different pH-values.
   Increasing pH caused higher initial elimination rates of NMMO as well as
   higher formation rates of nitrate. In mass transfer limited experiments,
   the shortest time needed for NMMO removal was observed at pH 7. This
   could be explained on the one hand through the importance of
   (OH)-O-.-radicals for the oxidation of NMMO and on the other hand
   through ozone decomposition reactions by (OH)-O-.-radicals at high
   pH-values. Dissolved ozone increased rapidly after elimination of NMMO
   at pH 7 and 8.5. High oxygen uptake rates of biomass with ozonation
   products showed the increase of the biodegradability compared to the
   initial synthetic wastewater. An improvement of ozone efficiency for
   elimination of NMMO and organic carbon can be expected in a process
   using a bioreactor in a recycle system. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The extraction of water soluble extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)
   from activated sludge was investigated. The extraction procedure was
   based upon cation exchange using a cation exchange resin (CER).
   Activated sludge from two different types of treatment plants responded
   very similarly to the extraction procedure. The EPS yield was enhanced
   by increasing the stirring intensity, the amounts of CER added and by
   increasing the extraction time. For the chosen extraction procedure the
   yield was twice as high as other commonly used procedures. The extract
   consisted mainly of protein but also humic compounds, carbohydrates,
   uronic acids and DNA were found in significant amounts. The extracted
   amounts and relative fraction of the individual compounds strongly
   depended on how the extraction was performed. The ratio between protein
   and carbohydrate was found in the range 3.9-5.1 depending on the
   extraction time. Humic compounds and DNA were the compounds most easily
   extracted. HPSEC investigation of the extract revealed that the
   extraction did not significantly degrade the EPS. Some cell lysis was
   identified during the extraction for extraction times greater than 1-2 h
   by observing a decrease in cell number (stained by DAPI, CTC and
   acridine orange). The lysis was not considered a significant problem for
   contaminating the EPS. Measurements of the cell number and cell size
   distribution in the sludge suggested that the cell mass did not account
   for more than approximately 10-15\% of the total organic fraction of the
   investigated sludge. Two extraction strategies were formulated. One for
   a very gentle and one for a very effective method. Analytical methods
   for analysis of sludge and EPS extracts were compared and discussed. A
   corrected Lowry method for analyzing protein as well as humic compounds
   was implemented and found suitable. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A biochemical model was developed to explain the mechanism of volatile
   fatty acid (VFA) metabolism in Thermophilic Aerobic Digestion (TAD). The
   effects of substrate addition on the metabolic behavioral patterns of
   TAD biomass, from a pilot scale system, were examined. The majority of
   the substrates examined under batch test conditions, with TAD process
   biomass, under microaerobic conditions, were oxidized to an acetate
   intermediate. The model predicts that, under microaerobic conditions
   (i.e. oxygen demand of the biomass is greater than the oxygen supply of
   the aeration equipment), the NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)
   produced during oxidation of substrates can be reoxidized by operation
   of the respiratory chain. Therefore, the carbon flow can be uncoupled
   from the necessity to maintain redox balance via fermentative means.
   This uncoupling would allow the organisms in a TAD process, under
   microaerobic conditions, to simplify metabolism and maximize ATP
   (adenosine triphosphate) production by increasing the flux of substrates
   to acetate.
   The oxidation of compounds, which required the net reduction of NAD(+),
   under anaerobic batch test conditions, could not proceed and remained in
   the unoxidized form. The oxidation of substrates, which required no net
   reduction of NAD(+), could and did proceed under fermentative
   conditions. The model predicts that, under strict anaerobic conditions
   (i.e. fermentative), bacteria must achieve oxidation/reduction balance
   by diverting the catabolic flow of carbon to fermentative end products
   to consume NADH (e.g. propionate). The key factor in fermentation is the
   conversion of specific intermediates to fermentation products by
   pathways which recycle NADH to regenerate NAD(+). The oxidation of
   substrates that require the net reduction of NAD(+) cannot proceed under
   fermentative conditions. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{This study focused on the membrane fouling mechanisms during the
   longtime operation of a membrane-coupled anaerobic bioreactor (MCAB)
   system designed for the treatment of alcohol-distillery wastewater. This
   system provided interesting information on anaerobic digestion and
   membrane performance associated with the fouling mechanisms in the
   membrane bioreactor. Enhanced COD removal was achieved with the complete
   retention of biomass either inside the anaerobic reactor or on the
   membrane surface. Membrane fouling was mainy attributed to external
   Fouling, which was closely related to the movement of cell population to
   the membrane surface and inorganic precipitation at the membrane
   surface. The major composition of the inorganic foulant was identified
   as MgNH4PO4 . 6H(2)O (struvite), whose deposition together with the
   microbial cells attached at the membrane surface played a significant
   role in the formation of the strongly attached cake layer limiting
   membrane permeability. The struvite precipitation/deposition mechanisms
   were examined thoroughly in relation to the chemical composition of the
   influent wastewater and the subsequent anaerobic decomposition in the
   membrane bioreactor. The conceptual resistance-in-series model was
   applied to assess the fouling characteristics. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{The possibility of minimizing sludge production in aerobic wastewater
   treatment through manipulation of the ecosystem so that most of the
   bacterial biomass produced is consumed by predating protozoa and metazoa
   was studied. The study was carried out on different pulp and paper
   industry wastewaters. In all of the experiments, the wastewater was
   first subjected to treatment in a completely mixed, aerobic reactor
   without biomass retention, favouring the growth of fast-growing
   dispersed bacteria consuming the readily biodegradable organic matter in
   the wastewater. After treatment at this stage, the wastewater was led to
   a reactor for growth of predators consuming the bacteria. Different
   designs of the predator stage, i.e. biofilm and suspended growth
   reactors, were used in different experiments. In all of the experiments,
   the total suspended solids (TSS) content of the wastewater increased
   considerably in the first reactor because of the production of bacterial
   biomass after which it was reduced significantly in the second reactor
   in which large amounts of different types of protozoa and metazoa
   developed. The apparent sludge yield in the processes varied between
   0.01 and 0.23 kg TSS/kg COD removed, which is considerably lower than
   the yields generally obtained for treatment of similar wastewaters in
   conventional treatment processes. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A continuous countercurrent liquid/liquid extractor was developed to
   concentrate trace organic pollutants from large water samples.
   Non-volatile hydrophobic pollutants were extracted using methylene
   chloride in a pulsed column system (1 m x 15 mm ID). The procedure
   follows EPA method 625 to separate the water sample into basic/neutral
   and acidic compounds.
   Methylene chloride was chosen from a number of possible solvents
   (di-isopropylether, chloroform, hexane, ethyl acetate). Solvent
   efficiencies were studied using ultrapure water containing different
   model compounds (dimethylphtalate, anthracene, diphenylamine, atrazine,
   lindane, heptachlor, methyl parathion, 2-chlorophenol,
   2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, 2-chloro,4-nitrophenol).
   Methylene chloride was found to be the most efficient extractant of both
   non-polar and polar chemicals. Recoveries ranged between 75\% and 96\%
   after one step batch liquid/liquid extraction, except for
   dimethylphtalate (38\%).
   Pulsed column efficiency was evaluated for a 10 litre ultrapure water
   sample spiked with the same organic compounds as mentioned above
   (0.4-1.3 mu g/l concentration range). The average recovery was found to
   be 86\%. Continuous countercurrent extractor efficiency was comparable
   with that observed after a three step batch liquid/liquid extraction.
   Further, method sensitivity and sample representativity were both
   improved (concentration factor of 10,000 after 10 litre water
   extraction). The pulsed column, especially when coupled with GC/MS, can
   be used to identify trace organic pollutants at the ng/l level in
   natural waters.
   Countercurrent liquid/liquid extraction was applied to the analysis of
   natural surface waters from the Rhone River (France). Results are
   discussed with regard to EPA and EEC priority lists. Pollutants (such as
   organochlorine pesticides, triazines, monoaromatic and polyaromatic
   hydrocarbons, nitrophenols and chlorophenols) were identified by GC/MS
   at the ng/l level together with several natural organic compounds.
   Pulsed column extraction can thus be considered as an appropriate
   multiresidue method for monitoring pollution in natural water. Copyright

Abstract = {{The effects of Cu2+ ions and beta-HCH
   (beta-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane) on microcosms containing
   bacteria, a protozoa (Cyclidium), two rotifers (Philodina and Lepadella)
   and a green alga (Chlorella) were investigated. The time-dependent
   changes in the respiration rate (community metabolic rate) were
   different from those of the control at a Cu2+ ion concentration of 0.4
   ppm and at a beta-HCH concentration of 0.1 ppm. The calculation of the
   time-dependent changes in the respiration rate was assumed to be used as
   an index which determines whether the concentrations of the chemical
   agents have an effect on the material cycles in the system. This
   inference was supported by the results calculated using the mathematical
   model of changing the maximum (physiological) growth rate coefficient of
   organisms. In addition, the possibility of changes in the degree of
   changes in the respiration rate when changing the growth rate
   coefficient was discussed based on the kinds of constituent organisms

Abstract = {{An automatic method for the determination of dissolved organic carbon in
   natural waters is described. The method relies on the catalytic
   oxidation of dissolved organic matter to CO2 by UV radiation and using a
   titanium dioxide semiconductor as a catalyst. Several compounds
   including urea and fulvic acid were mineralised completely. Compared
   with direct photolysis, the semiconductor catalytic photolysis gave
   consistently higher mineralisation yields for natural organic matter in
   seawater. The fraction resistant to direct UV photolysis (i.e.
   UV-refractory) was found to be in the range of 2\%-5\% of total DOC and
   it is suggested that this consists of organic macromolecules that
   fragment to non-UV absorbing species and escape further oxidation in
   direct UV photolysis. Organic macromolecules concentrated by molecular
   filtration contained 10\%-50\% such material, the higher proportion was
   found during the productive season in the sea, suggesting their primary
   biological origin (rather than degraded organic matter).
   The throughput of the method can be up to 30 samples per h and it is
   capable of online real-time analysis of DOG. The method gives linear
   calibration of up to 1000 mu M C and blanks (instrument, reagent and
   distilled water blanks) can be readily and easily evaluated.
   Attempted validation of the method against CHN elemental analysis,
   highlighted several inherent basic problems. Initial validation showed
   that within the analytical errors, the two methods were in close
   agreement. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Redissolved, particulate and sedimentary manganese were studied in the
   anoxic hypolimnion of the small monomictic Lake Fukami-ike in central
   Japan. The amounts of particulate and dissolved manganese in the water
   column were observed. The release of dissolved manganese starts
   gradually beginning in March. DMn reaches especially high levels of 93
   mgMn m(-2)d(-1) from the end of May to the end of June calculated from
   the gradient of a regression formula for the daily change in DMn. The
   rate of accumulated PMn is 0.64 mgMn m(-2)d(-1) from the end of July
   calculated from the gradient of a regression formula for the daily
   change in PMn.
   An accumulation of PMn and an associated decrease in dissolved organic
   carbon (DOG) were observed at the transition zone of oxic and anoxic
   layers. These facts seem to suggest that the DOC decrease involves the
   consumption of DOC as an electron donor by bacterial catalysis For the
   reduction of MnO2. The upward and downward DOC fluxes, 0.320 mmolC
   m(-2)d(-1), were calculated by the mean gradient values of the upward
   and downward DOC concentrations. The mean DOC flux was calculated by
   both the mean gradient DOC and the vertical diffusion coefficient
   (0.0304 m(-2)d(-1)). Manganese-reducing bacteria could contribute as
   much as 24\% to the DOC decrease in the oxic and anoxic layers,
   considering bacterial assimilation efficiency (64\%). Vertical diffusion
   Mn Bur from the interstitial water to the hypolimnion is then assumed to
   be 2 mgMn m(-2)d(-1).
   Mn for the vertical eddy diffusion flux, the vertical diffusion flux
   from interstitial water of the bottom sediment, the sinking flux and
   microbiological Mn flux were obtained, and the biogeochemical manganese
   cycle in Lake Fukami-ike was calculated. DMn flux in the oxic and anoxic
   layers by manganese-reducing bacteria is 0.004 gMn m(-2)d(-1), a value
   corresponding to 10\% of DMn Aux. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Chlorendic acid, a fire retardant, was subjected to sequential
   chemical/biological oxidation. Degradation of chlorendic acid was
   achieved by ozonation with chlorinated and non-chlorinated by-product
   production. The destruction of chlorendic acid and by-product
   distribution was a function of ozone contact time. After 450 min of
   ozonation, chlorendic acid and TOC removal percentages equaled 98\% and
   62.5\%, respectively. When subject to 210 min of UV oxidation,
   chlorendic acid and TOC removal equaled 70 and 31\%, respectively. With
   combined ozone/UV, near complete removal of chlorendic acid and TOC was
   achieved in 90 and 120 min, respectively. In biodegradation testing,
   chlorendic acid was not degradable. Biodegradation efficiency (DOG
   removal) of chlorendic acid ozonation by-products was a function of
   ozone contact time and approached 80\%. Chlorendic acid UV oxidation
   products (210 min contact time) were poorly biodegraded. Ozone/UV
   oxidation products (40 min contact time) from chlorendic acid achieved
   89\% biodegradation. Biodegradation rates of chlorendic acid chemical
   oxidation by-products also were assessed. Based on the computed
   biokinetic values of biodegradation rates for the chemical oxidation
   products of chlorendic acid are sufficiently high to enable use of
   existing biological process infrastructure for treatment of chemical
   oxidation products. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted to investigate the ammonia, nitrite and
   nitrate removal from aqueous solution using ozonation and ion exchange.
   The operating variables of the combined ozonation and ion exchange
   processes include the pH, initial concentration of nitrogenous compounds
   and flow rate of aqueous solution. The effects of those variables on the
   removal efficiencies of the nitrogeneous compounds by ozonation, or ion
   exchange or both were explored. Ozonation was found able to completely
   convert nitrite to nitrate. However its capability of ammonia removal is
   much limited. The anionic and cationic ion exchange resins were able to
   efficiently remove nitrate and residual ammonia. An optimal operating
   range of OH for ammonia removal by the combined ozonation and ion
   exchange was obtained. However, removal of nitrite and/or nitrate by
   combined ozonation and ion exchange was found to be relatively
   insensitive to pH. It was observed that the combined process is capable
   of efficiently maintaining the nitrogeneous compounds in the aqueous
   solution at very low concentration levels. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Reducing agents, namely sodium thiosulfate, are used to eliminate
   oxidant residuals in samples for biodegradable dissolved organic carbon
   (BDOC) analyses. For the particular BDOC assay used in this study,
   samples are seeded using a natural bacterial inoculum. These bacteria
   grow in response to dissolved organic carbon (DOG) and the decrease in
   DOC measured during the thirty day batch incubation period determines
   the BDOC of the sample. Na2S2O3 is usually added in excess, leaving a
   residual thiosulfate concentration which has been found in this study to
   interfere with the BDOC measurement. The effect of Na2S2O3 residuals
   between 0 and 34 mg/l on the measured value of BDOC was tested. The
   interference increased with the amount of Na2S2O3 added and above 20
   mg/l, sodium thiosulfate caused a substantial underestimation of the
   BDOC. The natural bacterial inoculum was indirectly found to contain
   bacteria capable of metabolizing thiosulfate. At concentrations above 20
   mg Na2S2O3/l, these bacteria produced sufficient acid that the
   heterotrophic activity necessary in the BDOC assay was effected. More
   tests are required to determine if the growth of these sulfur-oxidizers
   effects BDOC values in the absence of pH change. The use of a phosphate
   buffer should be considered in samples of limited buffering capacity.
   Given the observed effects of Na2S2O3, residuals should be limited and,
   where possible, the use of Na2S2O3 should be avoided. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{This work focuses on the kinetics of cis-1,2-dichloro-ethylene (c-DCE)
   biodegradation at very low concentrations (mu g/l range) in an aerobic
   fixed-film reactor inoculated with a mixed culture of methane-oxidizing
   bacteria. Analysis of dissolved components (oxygen, methane, c-DCE) were
   performed by membrane-inlet mass-spectrometry allowing an on-line
   control of the reactor performance. The c-DCE degradation rate constant
   k(x)/K-s ranged from 0.1 to 5.5 x 10(-2)m(3)d(-1)g(x)(-1), depending on
   the c-DCE concentration. However, this degradation rate was
   underestimated because the amount of active biomass in the biofilm was
   small (15\% to 20\% of the total biofilm dry weight). Toxicity effects
   were observed when the c-DCE initial concentration was above 100 mu g/l,
   leading to a decrease of the c-DCE and methane removal rate. Analysis
   showed the formation of an intermediate compound subsequent to the c-DCE
   degradation. Preliminary analysis suggested that it was c-DCE-epoxide.
   This degradation product or its metabolites seem to be the cause of the
   deactivation of the cells. However, the toxic effect could be
   counterbalanced, and the c-DCE degradation rate could be partly
   sustained if methane was supplied continuously in the reactor so that
   inactivated cells were replaced. These results are of practical interest
   for groundwater restoration or for waterworks since concentrations
   generally encountered in contaminated aquifers are in the mu g/l range.

Abstract = {{Factors influencing the desorption behavior of cadmium from goethite in
   aqueous solution are investigated using batch desorption experiments.
   Less cadmium was desorbed with increasing pH from 5 to 7. The presence
   of calcium increased the desorption at high Cd(II) loadings due to
   competition between cadmium and calcium for goethite surface sites.
   Limited effects of ionic strength are noted. EDTA at concentrations less
   than that of total Cd(II) present are found to inhibit cadmium
   desorption, especially at pH 5. Minimum Cd(II) desorption occurred near
   a 1:1 EDTA:Cd(II) total concentration ratio. Additions of chloride and
   NTA also suppress Cd(II) desorption. The inhibited desorption is
   attributed to re-adsorption of metal-ligand complexes onto the goethite.

Abstract = {{Copper/silver ionization is a new disinfection method that is being used
   to eradicate Legionella pneumophila from hospital hot water
   recirculating systems. The objective of this study was to determine the
   susceptibility of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 to copper and silver ions
   alone and in combination. L. pneumophila serogroup 1 (L. p. sg(-1)) was
   completely inactivated (6-log reduction) at copper concentration of 0.1
   mg/l within 2.5 h, whereas more than 24 h was required to achieve a
   similar reduction at the highest silver ion concentration tested (0.08
   mg/l). Checkerboard method and Gard additive model prediction
   demonstrated that copper and silver ions in combination could result in
   additive or synergistic effect depending on the concentration of copper
   and silver ions. Under the experimental conditions used in this study,
   synergism of copper/silver ions in eradicating L. p. sg(-1) was observed
   at higher concentration combinations of copper/silver ions (e.g.
   0.04/0.04 mg/l) while only an additive effect was observed at lower
   concentration combinations (e.g. 0.02/0.02 mg/l). This study suggested
   that both copper and silver ions are effective in inactivating L.
   pneumophila and the combined effect is greater than that seen with
   either ion alone. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Title = {{Reduction of phenol content and toxicity in olive oil mill waste waters

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Olive oil mill waste waters (OMW) constitute a major environmental
   problem because of the large amount produced and the toxicity of the
   phenolic compounds present. Several of these aromatic compounds can be
   assimilated to many of the components of lignin. Only few
   microorganisms, mainly `'white-rot'' basidiomycete, are able to degrade
   lignin by means of oxidative reactions catalysed by phenol oxidases and
   peroxidases.
   Both the low degree of specificity which characterizes these enzymes,
   and the structural relationships of many aromatic pollutants with the
   natural substrates of the enzymes, have suggested the use of
   ligninolytic organisms and of their enzymes for the treatment of these
   kinds of substrates.
   This paper investigates the ability of the `'white-rot'' basidiomycete
   Pleurotus ostreatus and particularly of the phenol oxidases it produces
   in the detoxification of OMW phenol compounds.
   Treatment of OMW with purified phenol oxidase showed a significant
   reduction of phenolic content, but no decrease of its toxicity was
   observed when tested on Bacillus cereus. Otherwise, the effect of
   processing OMW with the entire microorganism resulted in a noticeable
   detoxification of the waste with concomitant abatement of the phenol
   content. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of applying an optical monitor in the automatic control
   of coagulation was assessed in this study. Prior to simulation testing,
   a series of batch tests was performed to determine the optimum state of
   dosing corresponding to the monitor's output. The results indicate that
   floc density decreased as floc size increased under the same coagulant
   dosage. Moreover, ratio output of the monitor could provide an index for
   evaluating the change trend of flee size in flocculation and for
   predicting the potential of flee settling.
   An automatic control system was designed and connected to a
   laboratory-scale water treatment process. A computer in the automatic
   control system received all the ratio values with respect to the
   progressive dosing. After determining the dosage, the system terminated
   the function of control. This control system started performing a new
   test for determining another optimum dosage when the fluctuation of
   inflow turbidity was more than a designated value. Simulation tests
   demonstrated that the PDA monitor with a designed control system could
   be successfully applied in the on-line control of coagulation dosing.
   The recommended control parameters for the control system was also
   identified. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{The thermodynamic database distributed with the widely used equilibrium
   speciation model MINTEQA2 contains errors in reactions involving organic
   ligands. Users of this model should check the log equilibrium constants
   (log K) supplied with the model's database against constants from
   critically reviewed compilations. The comparison of constants is not
   straightforward and may involve one or more data reduction steps, such
   as correcting the log K to zero ionic strength and to a temperature of
   25 degrees C. More importantly, it is necessary to reformulate the
   reaction from the literature in terms of the same components (reactants)
   used in MINTEQA2 before making the comparison. Use of the MINTEQA2 model
   without correcting errors in the database can lead to significantly
   erroneous results asis shown here for copper-EDTA speciation. Copyright

Abstract = {{Effect of sulfate on the anaerobic degradation of benzoate was
   investigated by using the chemostat-type reactors at 35 degrees C. The
   benzoate concentrations were equivalent to 1250-10,000 mg.l(-1) in COD
   (chemical oxygen demand) and the sulfate concentrations were equivalent
   to 167-1670 mg.l(-1) in sulfur (S). Interactions between the
   methane-producing bacteria (MPB) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB)
   were dependent strongly on the ratio of COD/S in wastewater. The MPB
   consumed 99\% of the available electron donors at COD/S ratio of 60, but
   consumed only 69\% at ratio of 1.5, and 13\% at 0.75. The biochemical
   reactions and the bacterial composition in the biomass were also
   governed by the COD/S ratio. At high COD/S ratios (3.0 or higher),
   benzoate was degraded mainly to methane via acetate and
   hydrogen/formate. The degradation of benzoate required the syntrophic
   association between the hydrogen-producing acetogens such as Syntrophus
   buswellii and hydrogen-consuming MPB, plus Methanothrix-like MPB. On the
   other hand, at low COD/S ratio (1.5 or lower), benzoate was consumed
   mainly by SRB, converting sulfate into sulfide and suppressing the
   methane production. The anaerobic degradation of benzoate was partially
   inhibited when sulfide concentration was high. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{The relationship between time dependent population dynamics of
   nitrifiers and heterotrophs in undefined mixed-population biofilms and
   their nitrification efficiency was experimentally investigated at
   various C:N ratios of feed solutions. Five types of biofilms were
   cultured in partially submerged rotating biological contactors (RBC's)
   at different C:N ratios and were used as test materials. The results
   indicated that initial microbial composition in the biofilms and
   substrate composition (e.g. C:N ratio) strongly influenced the later
   population dynamics and the nitrification efficiency. Higher influent
   C:N ratio retarded accumulation of nitrifying bacteria, especially
   NO2-oxidizers, resulting in a considerably long start-up period for
   complete and stable nitrification due to competition for dissolved
   oxygen and space in the biofilm. Furthermore, a start-up inoculum was
   very important to keep start-up time of nitrification to a minimum.
   Time-dependent population dynamics in the biofilms reflected well the
   bulk water quality and microbial community structure in the bulk liquid.
   These results suggest that the structure of microbial community in the
   biofilm can be predicted from monitoring the water quality and
   microbiology of the bulk liquid. Physiologically inactive cells in the
   biofilm were determined by an INT dehydrogenease assay. These cells
   gradually accumulated up to about 30\% of the total bacterial population
   within the biofilms. The results of this study will provide a rational
   basis for developing and controlling desired biofilm population dynamics
   to maximize nitrification efficiency of wastewater biofilms Copyright

Abstract = {{Simultaneous enhanced biological phosphate uptake and biological

   acceptor. The phosphate uptake in anoxic conditions was compared to that
   in aerobic environment in batch tests. The results of the long-term
   operation of continuous-flow lab-scale system as well as the results of
   batch tests showed that the anoxic phosphate uptake with simultaneous
   denitrification after preceding anaerobic substrate uptake could
   significantly reduce the extent of competition for organic substrate
   between poly-P bacteria and denitrifiers. A side-stream nitrification in
   fixed-film reactor enabled to reduce the losses of organic carbon by
   aerobic oxidation and to stabilise the slow-growing population of

Abstract = {{The aggregation of fine primarily formed calcium phosphate particles
   with sand grains in a fluidized bed for phosphate removal was studied
   experimentally by means of a set-up which isolated aggregation from
   other processes during calcium phosphate precipitation, as well as
   through experiments under normal operation of the fluidized bed. The net
   aggregation process was described by means of a mathematical model which
   takes into account two competing mechanisms: orthokinetic aggregation
   and breakage. The net aggregation process was found to account for
   similar to 60\% of the phosphate removed by the fluidized bed. It was
   found that the orthokinetic aggregation can be improved by spreading the
   supersaturation more evenly throughout the reactor, and breakage can be
   diminished by a low energy dissipation rate in the bed. Optimization of
   the phosphate removal efficiency was therefore achieved by selecting
   sand grains of small sizes (0.1-0.3 mm) and a low superficial velocity
   (7 . 10-3 m/s), and by spreading the addition of the NaOH solution
   (reactant) over two dosage points. Under these conditions the phosphate
   removal efficiency was similar to 80\%. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

   contributions of the single ozonation and the photochemical reaction and
   applying the film theory model. The apparent kinetic constants and
   reaction orders for the combined reaction are deduced and correlated as
   a function of pH and temperature. In the second case, an empirical
   reaction rate expression which considers the contribution of both
   oxidants, UV radiation and hydrogen peroxide, is proposed. The kinetic

Abstract = {{Overflowing water from waterfilled mines and open pits in pyrite and
   coal mine areas is often acid and severely polluted by metals and
   sulfate. The effect of stimulating bacterial sulfate reduction in such
   systems in order to improve water quality was examined in a bench scale
   experiment. Polyacrylate cylinders with a sand bed and a layer of
   crushed stones at the bottom were filled with acid mine water, supplied
   with whey to support bacterial growth and incubated for 203 d. After an
   initial lag phase, pH started to increase, redox potentials dropped and
   dissolved concentrations of copper, zinc, iron and aluminium were
   reduced in cylinders supplied with whey. Simultaneously, a black sludge
   was formed. Acetate tended to accumulate as an undesired waste product.
   The observations indicate that sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) became
   active in the cylinders and contributed to metal removal. Inoculation
   with SRB shortened the initial lag phase, but was not necessary to
   initiate the sulfate-reduction process. The in situ treatment concept
   may be useful in relatively small and well defined mine water systems,
   where the process can be governed properly. (C) 1996 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{We present a statistical analysis of bioassays for fish growth, such as
   the routine toxicity test that is described in the OECD guideline 210.
   The analysis is based on the Dynamic Energy Budget theory and a
   one-compartment kinetics for the toxic compound. It is fully process
   oriented. We compare a formulation in terms of direct effects on growth
   with indirect effects via assimilation and maintenance. All formulations
   characterize the effects by a no-effect concentration, a tolerance
   concentration and the elimination rate. Simplified formulations are
   obtained for very small and very large elimination rates. The accuracy
   of estimates for the no-effect concentration is judged with the profile
   likelihood function. The method is illustrated with applications to
   several data-sets for body size versus concentration of toxicant.

Abstract = {{The effect of the accumulation of fixed biomass on the specific activity
   of nitrifying biofilm was studied in a continuous flow reactor. The
   specific activity of nitrifying biofilm was described by the specific
   removal rate of ammonium-N (q(obs)) The observed relationship between
   q(obs) and the film thickness was apparent to an inverse V-shaped curve.
   The maximum specific activity of biofilm was attained at a film
   thickness in the range 15-25 mu m, at which a steady state was
   established in the liquid phase for different influent ammonium-N
   concentrations (So). Beyond such a range, the specific activity began to
   decline significantly with the additional accumulation of biofilm. It
   was demonstrated from both experimental and theoretical approaches that
   reduction in the specific activity of biofilm was closely related to the
   ratio of active biomass to the accumulation of inactive materials within
   the biofilm. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

   initial pH of 4 with increasing ionic strength. The inhibitory
   adsorption is attributed to the blockade of surface sites by
   electrolytes. In addition, electrolytes play an important role on the
   pa-dependent dichlorvos adsorption. It is suggested that at pH < pH(pzc)
   (point of zero charge), dichlorvos adsorption is inhibited because
   electrolytes compete with dichlorvos fbr surface sites. At pH > pH(pzc)
   the adsorption density of dichlorvos decreases with increasing solution
   pH due to the decrease of surface group, TiOH, on the TiO2 surface. The
   variation of adsorption density with temperature over the range 10
   degrees-40 degrees C has been investigated. Results show that the
   reaction is controlled by enthalpy. The adsorption of dichlorvos onto
   the TiO2 surface is primarily brought about by hydrogen bonding.

Abstract = {{The precipitation features of calcium phosphate in a fluidized bed
   reactor in the concentration range between 5 and 100 mg P l(-1) were
   studied, and the conditions for optimum phosphate removal efficiency
   were established. The supply of calcium ions should be such that a Ca/P
   molar ratio of 3 at the inlet of the reactor is achieved. If the water
   to be treated does not contain magnesium or carbonate ions, the supply
   of base should suffice to promote a conversion of 50-55\% of the
   incoming phosphate to the solid phase. In the presence of carbonate and
   magnesium ions, the base supply should provide a conversion of 80-95\%.
   Magnesium and carbonate ions did not have a detrimental effect on the
   phosphate removal efficiency for inlet concentrations of up to 4.8 x
   10(-3) (Mg/P < 2 mol mol(-1)) and 4.8 x 10(-3) kmol m(-3), respectively.
   The feasibility of a process based on the precipitation of magnesium
   phosphate instead of calcium phosphate was demonstrated for waters with
   a low calcium content (Ca/P < 0.8 mol mol(-1)). Finally a method is
   presented to select process conditions where co-precipitation of
   unwanted phases can be avoided. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{n-Propanol formation and consumption during ethanol oxidation by
   anaerobic brewery granules was investigated. The granules were taken
   from an UASB reactor fed with a synthetic brewery waste water. Ethanol
   degradation assays and an isotopic assay using C-13-labeled ethanol and
   bicarbonate were performed. Intermediate products propionate,
   n-propanol, acetate, hydrogen, formate and carbon monoxide were
   observed. Results have shown a consistent and reproducible trend of
   ethanol being converted to, primarily intermediates propionate and
   acetate with some accumulation of n-propanol. Hydrogen and carbon
   monoxide concentration accumulated to 1120 and 50 ppm in the gas phase,
   respectively. Methane and carbon dioxide were the terminal products,
   Bicarbonate was not a significant contributor of carbon for n-propanol
   production based on C-13 assay results. From reaction energetics
   analysis and ethanol degradation assays, reactions of hydroformylation
   of ethanol with carbon monoxide and hydrogen, ethanol condensation,
   propionate reduction, and, ethanol oxidation coupled with propionate
   reduction are potentially responsible for the formation of propanol
   during anaerobic ethanol oxidation. Carbon monoxide is likely an
   additional carbon to ethanol during the formation of n-propanol.
   Hydrogen appeared to play a strong role as a driving force governing
   reactions involving propionate. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{In a laboratory experiment, artificial rainwater was passed through Fe-
   and Al-precipitated sludge. The release of phosphorus (P) at different
   temperatures and different oxygen conditions was studied up to 160 d.
   Under anaerobic conditions and at a temperature of 20 degrees C, 95\% of
   the total P in sludge was released as phosphate. In contrast, in an
   aerobic environment at the same temperature, only between 20 and 30\% of
   the total phosphorus was released. Water oxygen status and how size
   through the sludge were found to be the main factors controlling the P
   release. Phosphorus fractionations demonstrated that 75\% of the total P
   in sludge initially was found in the NaOH extractable fraction
   representing P adsorbed to Fe compounds, for example. After passage of
   oxygenated artificial rainwater, a transformation to more inert
   P-compounds occurred (HCl extractable and inert P) while only 10\%
   remained in the NaOH extractable fraction. The risk of increasing
   non-point pollution of P from P-accumulating sludge deposits is

Abstract = {{Denitrifying dephosphatation enables the removal of phosphorus and
   nitrogen with minimal use of GOD, minimal oxygen consumption and minimal
   surplus sludge production. Moreover it would make aeration only
   necessary For nitrification. Therefore we have studied an
   anaerobic-anoxic (A(2)) sequencing batch reactor (SBR) coupled to a
   nitrification SBR. Denitrifying phosphorus removing bacteria (DPB) and
   nitrifiers were completely separated in two sludges in these two SBRs.
   The nitrified supernatant was recirculated from the nitrification SBR to
   the A(2) SBR where nitrate was utilized by DPB as an electron acceptor
   for phosphorus removal. The technical feasibility for simultaneous
   phosphorus and nitrogen removal in the proposed two-sludge system was
   evaluated. The benefits of two-sludge systems over single-sludge systems
   were also discussed. It could be concluded that the separation of the
   nitrification step leads to an optimal process design for the
   application of denitrifying dephosphatation. The two-sludge system
   showed stable phosphorus and nitrogen removal, and enabled the removal
   of 15 mg-P/l and 105 mg N/l at the expense of only 400 mg-COD/l acetic
   acid. Stoichiometric calculations showed that, in the two-sludge system
   the required COD can be up to 50\% less than for conventional aerobic
   phosphorus and nitrogen removal systems. Moreover oxygen requirements
   and sludge production can be decreased in significant amounts of about
   30 and 50\%, respectively. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{We present a statistical analysis of bioassays for Daphnia survival and
   reproduction, such as the routine toxicity test that is described in the
   OECD guideline 202. The analysis is based on the Dynamic Energy Budget
   theory and a one-compartment kinetics for the toxic compound. It is
   fully process oriented. We compare a formulation in terms of effects on
   survival during oogenesis to various direct and indirect effects on the
   energetics of reproduction. All formulations characterize the effects by
   a no-effect concentration, a tolerance concentration and the elimination
   rate. We conclude that all options lead to similar no-effect levels. We
   compare the analysis to the standard NOEC/EC50 analysis and conclude
   that our analysis is both simpler and more effective. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{The interactions of Mn-54 radionuclide with ethylenediaminetetraacetic
   acid (EDTA) and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) were studied in freshwater

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The binding properties of alginate with calcium and aluminium ions have
   been studied, as a step towards understanding how algal extracellular
   organic matter (EOM) interferes with conventional aluminium-based
   coagulation/flocculation drinking water treatment. Alginate has been
   used as a model for algal EOM. Binding strengths and binding capacities
   have been determined, using an ion selective electrode for calcium and
   equilibrium dialysis for aluminium. Calcium and aluminium ions begin to
   bind above pH 3.5, co-incident with alginic acid deprotonation.
   Steady-state binding is achieved above pH 6. The variation in percent
   and absolute calcium ion uptake as a function of calcium to carboxyl
   ratio indicates that additional binding sites can be accessed at higher
   metal loadings. Alginate reaches a limiting capacity for calcium ions of
   approximately one calcium ion per eight carboxyl groups (or eight sugar
   units). Unlike calcium binding, a fixed number of aluminium binding
   sites are available for aluminium, irrespective of total concentration,
   corresponding to approximately one aluminium per seven carboxyl groups
   (or seven sugar units). On a carboxyl group concentration basis,
   alginate and fulvic acids (a fraction of natural organic matter) have
   similar capacities for aluminium ions, indicating that algal EOM can
   compete for aluminium intended for consumption by natural organic matter
   during coagulation. The addition of calcium ions prior to aluminium
   coagulation may minimise the influence of algal EOM on the coagulation
   process. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid (<2 min), simultaneous, non-chemical, non-destructive,
   cost-efficient measurement of the C, N, and P concentrations in
   suspended, particulate matter in water from lakes of varying trophic
   status, pH, and extent of metal contamination was attempted by the use
   of near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS). This technique, widely
   used in the agricultural, food, pharmaceutical, petrochemical, and
   textile industries, is being explored for its applications to aquatic
   and environmental sciences. Suspended matter from lake water (10-100 ml)
   was collected on 2.5 cm dia. G/FC glass fibre filters so that filters
   bore 10.5-109.2 mu g C, 0.8-18.9 mu g N, and 0.09-2.67 mu g P per
   filter. Filters were oven-dried and scanned with an NIRSystems 6500
   near-infrared spectrophotometer. The spectral data were treated by
   multiple linear regression analysis to develop mathematical
   relationships (calibrations) between absorbance at particular
   wavelengths and amounts of C, N, and P determined by conventional
   chemical analytical methods. These calibrations were used to predict C,
   N, and P from an independent set of spectra. Agreement between these
   NIRS-predicted values and their chemical values was generally greater
   than 0.9 for C, N, and P (r(2) from 0.88 to 0.97). Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{While the performance of a commercially available electrolytic
   respirometer was being evaluated, it was discovered that the oxygen
   concentration in the head space of a respirometric vessel can decrease
   as the rate of oxygen consumption exceeds the rate of oxygen transfer
   from the electrolytic cell to the head space. The phenomenon could be
   corrected by initially filling the holding chamber in the electrolytic
   cell and in the conduit leading to the vessel head space with oxygen
   instead of air in order to improve the system response time. A series of
   experiments was conducted at different initial oxygen concentrations in
   the head space with and without purging the space in the electrolytic
   cell and the conduit to observe the above phenomenon and to demonstrate
   the validity of the proposed procedure. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Concentrations of Ag, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn and Hg,
   together with Na, K, Ca and Mg in 19 species of fish captured from the
   Indus River, Pakistan, are estimated by the atomic absorption method.
   Corresponding data for sediment and water from 11 sites along the
   down-stream route of the river are also reported. Mercury and arsenic
   concentrations were high (3.920 and 3.072 mu g/g, respectively) in the
   muscle of fish from Guddu barrage as compared with those from other
   sites. Hetroptirus fossilus showed maximum concentrations of Ag, Cu and
   Pb in its muscle as compared with other fish. Labeo calbasu from Guddu
   barrage showed highest As concentration at 3.072 mu g/g. Mystus vitatus
   from Chashma barrage contained maximum cadmium concentration at 0.990 mu
   g/g. Several other fish exhibited elevated levels of metals along the
   downstream route of the river, a trend exhibited also by the elevated
   metal contents of sediment and water at Guddu and Lloyd barrages. The
   study indicated a gross pollution of the sediment and water at various
   locations of the river, e.g. As (7.452 mu g/g) in sediment from Lloyd
   barrage, Hg (5.710 mu g/g) in sediment from Jinnah barrage, Pb (2.709 mu
   g/g) in sediment from Guddu barrage and Mn (0.038 mu g/g) in water from
   Lloyd barrage. The macronutrients showed an inverse relationship with
   trace metals. Hetroptirus fossilus could be used as indicator species

Title = {{Transmission electron microscopy of a phosphate effect on the colloid
   structure of iron hydroxide}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{30}},

Pages = {{1345-1352}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been used to study phosphate
   association;vith iron hydroxide colloid and consequent alteration of
   aggregated colloid structure. Three complementary sample preparation
   procedures were tested and images derived from them were correlated. A
   Nanoplast preservation and embedding procedure was found to minimize
   particle aggregation artifacts. With Nanoplast,primary particle size
   down to 1 nm was detected. Solvent dehydration followed by epoxy resin
   embedding produced similar results to Nanoplast embedding, although the
   use of epoxy resin resulted in a more time consuming procedure and image
   resolution was not as good.
   The TEM results show that aggregated iron hydroxide colloid has a
   ramified chain structure, extending in three dimensions to produce a
   highly porous, sponge-like precipitate. The size of the primary
   particles visualized was in the 1-4 nm range. Submicron scale elemental
   analysis for Fe and P in ultrathin sections of embedded colloid was done
   using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) ina scanning
   transmission electron microscope (STEM). An increased P/Fe ratio in the
   starting solution for producing iron-rich colloids led to an increased
   P/Fe ratio in the resulting colloids; it also caused an alteration of
   the chain structure of iron hydroxide colloid, leading to large
   agglomerates. This provides evidence of a phosphate effect on the
   aggregation behaviour of iron hydroxide. A study of field samples from a
   wastewater treatment plant suggests that phosphate incorporation by iron
   hydroxide colloid might be the main mechanism for chemical phosphorus
   removal in a municipal wastewater treatment process using iron salts.

Abstract = {{Phenol in wastewater could be effectively degraded in an upflow
   anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor. With a 1:1 effluent recycle
   ratio, over 97\% of phenol was removed at 37 degrees C and pH 6.9-7.5
   with 12 h of hydraulic retention time for phenol concentration up to
   1260 mg . l(-1); corresponding to 3000 mg . l(-1) of chemical oxygen
   demand (GOD) and a loading rate of 6 g-COD . l(-1). day(-1). The seed
   sludge took about 7 wk to develop the phenol-degrading capability which
   was sensitive to shocks. The bioactivity deteriorated readily when the
   granules were exposed to sudden changes of temperature and loading.
   Although the damage was not permanent, the recovery of bioactivity was
   gradual and lengthy. At 6g-COD . l(-1). day(-1), each gram of granules
   was able to convert 0.49g of COD into methane daily. On the average,
   about 94.7\% of the total COD removed was converted to methane, while
   the rest was converted to biomass with a net yield of 0.038 g-VSS
   .(g-COD-removed)(-1). Electron micrographs show that the granules were
   composed of, among others, Syntrophus buswellii-, Methanothrix-,
   Methanospirillum- and Methanobreuibacter-like bacteria. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{To characterize the colored components in the heat treatment liquor of
   waste sludge, three distinct liquor samples were fractionated into four
   fractions (I-IV) by HCl-precipitation and with XAD-7 resin. In all the
   samples tested fractions III, which were acid-soluble and eluted from
   the resin with methanol, contained 55-77\% of the total color. In one
   sample fraction I, which was acid-insoluble, also had relatively high
   color content (22\% of the total). Therefore, we defined fractions III
   and I as main color fractions of the heat treatment liquor. The color of
   fraction I decreased, but that of fraction III did not decrease during
   incubation of the liquor with activated sludge. Furthermore, the color
   of fraction I decreased as that of fraction III increased during the
   incubation. It was suggested that the colored components in fraction I
   are converted into the colored components fractionated into fraction III
   through the biological treatment. Molecular shape of the colored
   components in fractions I and III were affected by ionic strength: their
   molecular weight fell in higher ionic strength solvent. The two colored
   components were degraded with alkaline hydrogen peroxide. Identification
   of their degradation products revealed that both of them had partially
   the same chemical structures as the melanoidin pigment synthesized from
   glucose and glycine, and they had considerable common structures
   regardless of their presence in different fractions I and III. Copyright

Abstract = {{A non-seasonal discharge standard may be too stringent and not
   cost-effective for a season of large flow, if the variation of seasonal
   streamflow of a river is significant. Seasonal discharge programs
   established based on streamflow variation were therefore explored in
   this work. A design procedure using the dow duration curve method, two
   total-mass-load based discharge programs, linear programming, and
   Monte-Carlo analysis is proposed for determining and analyzing the
   pertinent seasonal division of a two-season discharge management
   program. The flow duration curve method was used to compute the design
   low flow. The maximal total waste load and uniform treatment programs
   were the two total-mass-load based programs analysed. Linear programming
   models were established to determine the optimal division of seasons
   based on the objective of maximally allowable total waste load.
   Monte-Carlo simulation with QUAL2E-UNCAS was implemented to assess the
   risk of violation of water quality of seasonal programs. The proposed
   procedure is demonstrated in a case study of the Tung-Kang River basin
   in Taiwan. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Biotransformation of chloroform (CF) was studied in a methanogenic
   environment utilizing acetic acid as the primary substrate. CF removal
   efficiency of more than 99\% was achieved in a chemostat, fed constant
   acetic acid concentration (2510 mg/l) and different CF concentrations,
   uh to 16.74 mu M. Biological methane potential tests were conducted in
   serum bottles using the culture from the chemostat with an average
   biomass concentration of 53 mg/l. The culture exhibited a maximum rate
   of CF transformation of 0.26 mu M/h corresponding to an initial CF
   concentration of 1.25 mu M. At initial CF concentrations higher than
   2.76 mu M, the rate of CF transformation became constant at 0.06 mu M/h.
   CF present at any concentration inhibited the utilization of acetic
   acid, and at CF concentrations equal to or exceeding 2.7 mu M, the
   culture was completely inhibited and no acetic acid; was utilized by the
   culture even after the CF was completely degraded. The culture
   transformed CF without the addition of acetic acid, but the addition of
   acetic acid considerably increased the rate of biotransformation.
   However, increase in acetic acid concentration beyond 50 mg/l did not
   increase the rate. The culture exhibited higher rates of CF
   biotransformation when it was acclimated with higher influent
   concentration of CF in a chemostat. Reductive dehalogenation was one of
   the pathways for the transformation of CF leading to the formation of
   dichloromethane which was also transformed by the culture. Copyright (C)

   average VSS concentration of 259 mg/l. These tests showed that the
   culture exhibited a maximum rate of CF transformation of 16.3 mu M/h
   corresponding to an initial CF concentration of 22.6 mu M. The culture
   degraded CF primarily by reductive dehalogenation leading to the
   formation of DCM which degraded at a very slow rate compared to CF. No
   inhibition of acetic acid utilization was observed in the culture for CF
   concentrations as high as 29.3 mu M. Compared to no acetic acid
   addition, acetic acid at 50 mg/l considerably increased the rate of CF

Abstract = {{Aerobic and sequential anaerobic-aerobic treatment of oil shale ash dump
   leachate (GOD 2000-3000 mg l(-1)) was studied at 7-10 degrees and at 20
   degrees C. The leachate was known to contain several phenolic compounds
   and have a high sulfur concentration. In the sequential
   anaerobic-aerobic processes, the chemical oxygen demand (GOD) removals
   were most of the time slightly lower at 10 degrees C (67\%) than at 20
   degrees C (73\%) while the biochemical oxygen demand for 7 days (BOD7)
   removals were 97-99\% at both temperatures. In the anaerobic stages, the
   COD removal was a result of sulfide production. In the single aerobic
   process at 20 degrees C, the COD removal was 65\% while at 7 degrees C
   the COD removal was 54\%. After the feed was changed from leachate to
   phenol in the 7 degrees C aerobic reactor, the COD removal stabilized to
   about 95\%. In all the leachate treatment processes studied, the total
   phenols removals were on average 78-86\%. The anaerobic stages removed
   total phenols minimally. An aerobic process at 7-20 degrees C alone
   seems feasible for treating oil shale ash leachate. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{The relationships between activity inducing chromosomal aberrations of
   waters treated with disinfectants and by-products were investigated by
   focusing on nitro and carbonyl groups, respectively. The contribution of
   the carbonyl group to activity inducing aberrations of treated waters
   was found to be large. On the other hand, the contribution of the nitro
   group was small. In the case of chlorinated water, organochlorine
   compounds contribute to activity inducing aberrations in addition to
   carbonyl group. The carbonyl group could be useful as a coarse indicator
   to compare activity inducing aberrations among waters treated with
   chlorine dioxide, chloramine, and ozone. Activity inducing aberrations
   of chlorinated water including the same amount of carbonyl group was
   demonstrated to reach approximately 10 times those of waters treated
   with three other disinfectants. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Removal of microcystin toxins from drinking water was evaluated at two
   full scale treatment plants that employed coagulation-sedimentation,
   dual media filtration and chlorination combined with either granular

   of natural organic matter on the adsorption of the cyanobacterial toxin,
   microcystin-LR, by activated carbon was also evaluated in laboratory
   studies over a range of toxin concentrations similar to those typically
   observed in raw water at these plants. The sensitive protein phosphatase
   inhibition bioassay was used to quantify microcystin. Conventional
   treatment processes combined with activated carbon generally removed
   more than 80\% of microcystin from raw water, but a residual
   concentration of 0.1-0.5 mu g equivalents of microcystin-LR per liter
   was observed considering both (GAG and PAC) treatment facilities. Most
   values of residual microcystin-1R were at the low end of this range, but

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of drinking water treatment options for eliminating
   seasonal taste and odor events caused by phytoplankton blooms in the
   source water were evaluated. Dissolved air flotation (DAF), conventional
   gravity sedimentation (CGS), ozonation and granulated activated carbon
   (GAG) filtration processes were studied in pilot plant-scale
   experiments. Clarification by DAF consistently produced water with lower
   turbidity and particle counts (NP > 2.0 mu m/ml) than CGS. Mean particle
   counts detected in water following DAF and CGS treatment were 3600 and
   7500 particles/ml, respectively. The absolute abundance of phytoplankton
   in the source water was the single most important factor influencing DAF
   and CGS removal efficiency. Removal efficiencies for both processes were
   poorer at low source water biomass (near 250 mu g/l) than at higher
   biomass concentrations (1750 mu g/l). For the eight phytoplankton taxa
   present in the source water, DAF and CGS removal ranged from 29-85\% and
   21-49\%, respectively. With the exception of the total nanoplankton for
   which removal by both processes was comparable, all other taxa were
   removed more efficiently by DAF than CGS. Flavor profile analysis (FPA)
   indicated that DAF alone could not completely mitigate the strong fishy,
   musty odors associated with some phytoplankton blooms. Ozone altered the
   fishy odor to an undesirable `'plastic-like'' odor. Only filtration
   through GAG/sand filters removed all odors. Removal of soluble
   constituents such as color and total organic carbon (TOC) by DAF and CGS
   were comparable for most of the year. During phytoplankton blooms,
   however, TOC removal by DAF was significantly greater than by CGS. TOC
   and color removal were substantially greater through GAC than through
   anthracite filters. A combination of DAF clarification and GAC
   filtration was the most effective treatment combination for removal of
   particulates, color and taste and odor compounds. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{TCP concentration in the Kurose River, Higashi-Hiroshima, increases
   after rainy days, suggesting that typical contamination originates from
   non-point sources. Our study was focused on a greenhouse as an important
   source of TCP isomers. The amounts of TCP released from agricultural
   plastic films were studied. Field surveys during rainy days were also
   carried out to clarify the processes which release TCP isomers from the
   greenhouse with rainfall, and its accumulation and degradation processes
   in soil. The runoff processes of TCP from greenhouse to ditch and river
   was also investigated. Concentration of TCP isomers in rainfall drop
   from a greenhouse were significantly higher than those in rainwater and
   river water, indicating that agricultural plastic films were the
   probable source of TCP. The ratio of o-TCP concentration in rainfall
   drop from greenhouse decreased with time, whereas that of m-TCP
   increased. These results suggest that more o-TCP was released from
   plastic film than m-TCP. TCP released from plastic film by rainfall was
   preferentially adsorbed on the silt-clay fraction of the soil. The m-TCP
   isomer concentration in soil around the greenhouse increased if
   cumulative precipitation for 3 consecutive days before sampling was less
   than 20 mm, but decreased if it was more than 20 mm. TCP concentration
   in the soil was highest in the surface (0-1 cm) and decreased below the
   surface. The significant decrease with depth is probably affected by
   adsorption and biodegradation. TCP concentrations in surface soil and
   water decreased along the how of surface water from greenhouse to ditch.
   It is probable that TCP released from the greenhouse was transported to
   the ditch with adsorption on top soil. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Extracellular polymers (ECP) play an important role in biological
   wastewater treatment. They are believed to be responsible for the
   formations of flocculent activated sludge as well as anaerobic granules;
   In this study, the ECP characteristics of two types of enrichment
   cultures were examined. One enriched culture was composed of
   hydrogenotrophic methanogens (HM) alone while the other was composed of
   HM and hydrogenotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria (HSR). Both cultures
   were enriched through a series of 107 repeated batches using H-2/CO2
   plus, in the HM/HSR series, sulfate and nutrients. At various stages of
   the enrichment process, the ECP were extracted from the sludge samples
   and analyzed for their protein (ECP(p)) and carbohydrate (ECP(c))
   contents. Results showed that in the mixed culture HM consumed 67\% of
   hydrogen and HSR 33\%. The net yields of biomass for HM and HSR cultures
   were 0.046 g-VSS/g-COD and 0.059 g-VSS/g-COD, respectively. Productions
   of ECP were dependent upon substrate. Glucose-degrading sludge produced
   more ECP than the HM culture, which in turn produced more than the HSR
   culture. The net ECP yields for HM culture were 1.06 mg-ECP(p)/g-COD and
   0.64 mg-ECP(e)/g-COD, respectively; the corresponding yields for HSR
   culture were 0.74 mg-ECP(p)/g-COD and 0.52 mg-ECP(c)/g-COD. For the
   enriched HM culture, more ECP(p), as well as ECP(c) but to a lesser
   degree, were produced at the beginning of each batch when high
   concentration of hydrogen was available. This was, however, not
   noticeable for the HSR culture. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Adaptation of denitrifying bacteria to the external carbon sources
   acetate and methanol was studied in bench-scale sequencing batch
   reactors. The reactors were seeded with sludge from a fun-scale
   pre-denitrifying activated sludge plant and operated in cycles
   consisting of a 23.5 h anoxic period followed by 23 h aeration. A
   control reactor received no additional carbon. Potential denitrification
   rate, measured with the acetylene inhibition technique, and the most
   probable number of bacteria denitrifying with the specific carbon source
   were followed for 52 days. Actual rates in the reactors were estimated
   from cumulative gas production during anoxic operation. A period of
   adaptation was necessary when methanol or acetate was the supplemental
   carbon source. Adaptation to acetate was also observed in the control
   reactor. The acetate sludge was, however, probably better adapted to
   acetate as evidenced by the greater increase in activity per bacterium.
   The increase continued even after the maximum denitrification rate was
   reached. During adaptation to methanol the methanol denitrifying
   capacity per bacterium was fairly constant while the potential rate
   increased after an initial lag-phase. Sewage water without external
   carbon did not cause an increased methanol activity that could be
   interpreted as adaptation. We suggest that the bacteria denitrifying
   with acetate could be the same as those using the electron donors in the
   sewage. The bacteria in the methanol reactor seemed to consist of one
   population denitrifying with methanol and another with compounds in the
   sewage. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Denitrification and methanogenesis of a synthetic wastewater containing
   volatile fatty acids and nitrate were obtained in a single-stage process
   using an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor. The reactor was
   initially inoculated with methanogenic granular sludge and was gradually
   adapted to nitrate by increasing the nitrate concentration in the
   influent. Excess carbon not utilized for denitrification was converted
   to methane. During steady-state at a loading of 336 mg NO3-N/1/d (24
   mmol NO3/1/d) and 6600 mg COD/1/d more than 99\% removal of both nitrate
   and carbon was achieved. Batch experiments with biomass from the reactor
   showed that approximately 90\% of the added nitrate was recovered as
   nitrogen gas indicating that true dentrification occurred. This was
   further verified from mass balances over the reactor. The granules
   changed appearance during the first 5 months of operation being fluffy
   and buoyant, probably reflecting changes in the microbial composition
   induced by the presence of nitrate. However, during the next two months
   more dense granules with good settling abilities gradually established
   in the system making this kind of combined process feasible in a UASB
   reactor. Characterization of the produced granules showed that while the
   mean diameter and density was comparable to granules from purely
   methanogenic systems, although the strength was lower. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Two thin layer chromatographic (TLC) procedures were evaluated for the
   capacity screening of cyanobacterial peptide hepatotoxins and anatoxin-a
   in laboratory-cultured strain samples and in natural bloom samples.
   Seventy-five samples previously investigated with the reference methods,
   the chief of which was mouse bioassay, were analyzed blindly by TLC.
   Forty-three of the samples were hepatotoxic according to the reference
   methods, and 39 of them were found to contain peptide hepatotoxins by
   TLC coupled to u.v.-densitometry. Seven samples contained anatoxin-a
   according to the reference methods, and five of these were found to
   contain anatoxin-a by TLC, using derivatization with Fast Black K salt.
   Four of the samples which were neurotoxic by mouse bioassay also
   contained hepatotoxins by TLC. Twenty-four samples were nontoxic
   according to the reference methods, and in 23 of these no toxins were
   found by TLC either. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{An approximate simulation of wetting front advance or leaching time is
   often the necessary and sufficient information required to optimize
   irrigation strategies or wastewater land treatment systems. For such
   simulations, we show that only three physically comprehensible and
   easily measured parameters are necessary, namely the saturated hydraulic
   conductivity, and the slope and the intercept of the soil-water
   potential plotted against the natural logarithm to the soil-water
   content. We derived the new 3-parameter simulation model from a fully
   linear flow model based on the Richards equation with the additional
   assumption of zero conductivity at zero soil-water content. A simple
   analytical solution for water infiltration during saturation at the soil
   surface, based on the 3-parameter model, gave results that compared well
   with measured wetting front advances in three Danish loamy and coarse
   sands and, also, with semi-analytical and numerical solutions from
   literature. Less agreement between predicted and measured wetting front
   advance was observed during infiltration into an initially dry forest
   soil due to extreme soil-water repellency. The presented derivation
   procedure assuming linear water dow seems promising for obtaining
   simple, approximate analytical solutions for unsaturated flow problems.

Abstract = {{The characteristics of organoclays as sorbents for neutral organic
   contaminants (NOCs); in aqueous systems containing multiple solutes were
   evaluated by measuring the sorption of trichloroethylene on
   hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA) exchanged illite and smectite in the
   absence and presence of carbon tetrachloride, nitrobenzene and ethyl
   ether. Trichloroethylene partitioned into HDTMA-derived phases present
   on the external surfaces of the clay particles manifesting type III
   isotherms. Carbon tetrachloride functioned to increase the solvency of
   the external HDTMA phase, and hence enhanced sorption of
   trichloroethylene. Nitrobenzene solvated HDTMA resulting in a more
   vertical orientation of the C-16 alkyl chains and interlayer expansion.
   This rendered the interlamellar region of HDTMA-smectite accessible for
   trichloroethylene sorption, and nitrobenzene sorption simultaneously
   increased the solvency of HDTMA phase for trichloroethylene. Ethyl ether
   sorption suppressed the uptake of trichloroethylene by decreasing the
   solvency of HDTMA phase for trichloroethylene. Sorption of
   trichloroethylene also facilitated sorption of carbon tetrachloride and
   nitrobenzene. The results suggest that multiple organic compounds
   generally produce a synergistic effect on the uptake of NOCs from water
   by HDTMA-clays, and support multiple mechanisms controlling the sorption
   process. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Ratios of DIN:DIP, indigenous algal assay and nitrogen fixation by
   phytoplankton were determined to estimate the limiting nutrient for
   phytoplankton growth in Hiroshima Bay, Seto Inland Sea, Japan. The algal
   assay was performed using indigenous pico-, nano- and microphytoplankton
   assemblages fractionated by filtration. Nitrogen fixation was determined
   using an acetylene reduction method. The DIN:DIP ratio in the study area
   was above 16:1 (Redfield ratio) in August 1993 and May 1994. However, in
   other months, the ratio was below 16:1. These values suggest that the
   growth of phytoplankton community is limited by nitrogen, with an
   exceptional phosphorus limitation in August 1993 and May 1994. Nutrient
   enrichment algal assay of size-fractionated phytoplankton community also
   supported these findings. The growth of picophytoplankton fraction was
   stimulated by phosphorus addition in August 1993 and May 1994, while
   nano- and microphytoplankton fractions were stimulated by nitrogen
   addition in almost all months during the study period. No nitrogen
   fixation by phytoplankton was detected during the study period. The
   results suggest that nitrogen rather than phosphorus is the limiting
   nutrient for the growth of the whole phytoplankton community, but
   picophytoplankton by itself, tends to be limited by phosphorus compared
   to other large-size phytoplankton when high DIN:DIP ratio was observed.

   the effects of adsorption characteristics, the average age of carbon
   particles, surface diffusion coefficient, particle size and carbon
   concentration on the effluent adsorbate concentration. Although there is
   no single, equivalent particle size that can exactly represent a
   particle-size distribution, the use of a carefully chosen equivalent
   particle size could lead to errors in adsorber performance predictions
   of less than 10\%. Unfortunately, there is no formal protocol for
   selection of the equivalent particle size and trial and error iterations

Abstract = {{Humic substances are amorphous organic macromolecules responsible for
   the hue of natural waters. They are also known to be precursors of
   mutagens formed on chlorination prior to distribution of drinking water.
   In this study humic substances from the waters of primary streams, from
   major rivers, and from reservoirs were isolated and fractionated into
   humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA) and XAD-4 acids using columns of
   XAD-8 and of XAD-4 resins in tandem, and the fractions from the
   different sources were chlorinated and assayed for mutagenicity. CPMAS
   C-13 NMR spectroscopy showed marked differences in compositions not only
   between HA, FA, and XAD-4 acids from the same water samples, but also
   between the same fractions from water samples from different watersheds.
   There were found to be strong similarities between the fractions from
   watersheds which had closely related soil types. Aromaticity was
   greatest in HAs, and lowest in XAD-4 acids, and carboxyl contents and
   aliphatic character were greatest in the XAD-4 acids. Carbon content
   decreased in the order HA > FA > XAD-4 acids, and amino acids and
   neutral sugars contents decreased in the order HA > XAD-4 > FA.
   Titration data complemented aspects of the NMR data, demonstrating that
   carboxyl content decreased in the order XAD-I acids > FA > HA, and
   indicated that phenolic character was highest in HAs and lowest in the
   XAD-4 acids. All samples tested gave rise to bacterial mutagens on
   chlorination. Although the mutagenicities were of the same order of
   magnitude for the chlorinated humic samples from the different sources,
   the samples which showed the greatest number of revertant bacterial
   colonies were from the Thames and Trent, large rivers with humic
   materials from diverse environments, and relatively high in amino acid
   contents. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Title = {{Interactions between wastewater quality and phosphorus release in the
   anaerobic reactor of the EBPR process}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1517-1527}},

Abstract = {{Studies on enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) operation in
   activated sludge processes have been conducted on a pilot plant at the
   Sjolunda wastewater treatment plant in Malmo, Sweden, since 1986. The
   plant receives wastewater from a combined sewer system. The aim of this
   study was to investigate interactions between variations in the
   wastewater quality and the effect on the EBPR operation. The paper
   focuses on the overall role of the concentration of volatile fatty acids
   (VFA) in the influent wastewater on the EBPR process. Firstly, the
   relation between VFA, COD and phosphorus in the influent wastewater at
   the plant is examined. Secondly, the effect of pH on phosphate release
   under anaerobic conditions is investigated. Finally, the observed
   relation between phosphate release in the anaerobic zone in relation to
   the concentration of VFA in the influent wastewater is discussed. The
   pilot plant consists of two parallel, activated sludge systems with
   EBPR, one system with a solids retention time (SRT) of 4 days, operated
   without nitrifcation-denitrification and one system with a SRT of 21
   days, operated with nitrification-denitrification. Results derived from
   daily, composite samples taken over 3 yr have formed the basis of a
   general description of the water quality and the performance of the
   process. In addition, intensive field studies and laboratory studies
   have been used as ways of investigating certain phenomena in more
   detail. The results of the pilot plant study showed that the
   concentration of total phosphorus on average was low in the effluent,
   below 0.5 mg P/1. Increased phosphorus concentrations were, however,
   observed on a number of occasions. High concentrations of phosphorus in
   the effluent were observed every year in July, which is the holiday
   period at industrial plants in Sweden. Other instances of increased
   phosphorus concentrations in the secondary effluent were recorded after
   prolonged periods of rain. Increasing how rates due to lain lead to a
   dilution and a change in the composition of the COD in the influent
   wastewater. A laboratory study showed that the ratio of phosphorus
   release/HAc uptake depends on pH in the range of 6-8. At neutral pH a
   ratio of 0.35-0.4 mg P/mg COD was found. The results of an intensive
   field study on the pilot plant suggested a relationship of 0.5 mg P/mg
   GOD. Hydrolysis and/or fermentation processes have to be taken into
   account when describing phosphorus release in the anaerobic reactor.
   However, it was clearly demonstrated that it is primarily the VFA in the
   influent wastewater that affect the release of phosphorus in the systems
   studied. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Title = {{Evaluation of E-coli as an indicator for the presence of Campylobacter

Abstract = {{Two enteric pathogens, Campylobacter jejuni and Yersinia enterocolitica,
   and the indicator bacterium Eschericiha coli, were investigated for
   survival in autoclaved lake water and susceptibility to chlorine at 4
   and 10 degrees C. In addition, survival of Y, enterocolitica was
   investigated in oligotrophic lake water. The 3-log reduction (99.9\%
   inactivation) time for Y enterocolitica in lake water was 17-18 days at
   4 degrees C and 14-15 days at 10 degrees C. After exposure to 0.2 mg/l
   Cl-2 a 3-log reduction was obtained for C.jejuni in 10-15 s, for Y.
   enterocolitica in 20-180 s, and for E, coli in 20-25 s, depending on
   bacterial strain, plasmid content and temperature. The same reduction of
   C. jejuni was obtained with 0.02-0.04 mg/l of free chlorine in 12 min at
   4 degrees C and 2 min at 10 degrees C. These results indicate that C,
   jejuni is more sensitive to chlorine than most other waterborne
   pathogens and E, coli, indicating that it may easily be controlled by
   present disinfection practices. Y. enterocolitica is about as sensitive
   to chlorine as E. coli, but may survive for a longer time in cold, clean
   surface waters. E. coli is an adequate indicator for C. jejuni both in
   water sources and in chlorinated drinking water. E. coli, however, is
   not a safe indicator for the presence of Y. enterocolitica O:3 under all
   conditions, and especially not in oligotrophic lake water. Furthermore,
   the results for Y. enterocolitica O:3 indicate an association between
   enhanced resistance to chlorine and the presence of a virulence plasmid.

Abstract = {{A preliminary study was carried out to assess the usefulness of
   manganese as an aid in the lime clarification of municipal wastewater.
   The approach was intended to take advantage of the potential sorption
   ability of manganese oxides for organic matter in the presence of
   divalent cations. In a batch clarification test, 94-95\% and 75-77\%
   reduction in turbidity and chemical oxygen demand (GOD) from a municipal
   wastewater were observed with 800 mg 1(-1) of lime and 30 mg 1(-1) of
   manganese sulphate, whereas the corresponding reductions were 60-61\%
   and 33-38\% with lime alone (800 mg 1(-1)). With ferric chloride (500 mg
   1(-1)), turbidity and COD reduction were 90-91\% and 66-68\%. Settled
   sludge volumes were 72, 70 and 128 mi 1(-1), respectively for the three
   treatments. Based on Ives' filterability number, calculated using both
   turbidity and COD as measures of filtrate quality, supernatant from
   lime-manganese sulphate treatment appeared to be more filterable than
   that from either lime alone or ferric chloride treatment. Following
   coal-sand filtration, lime-manganese sulphate treatment showed a higher
   overall removal of turbidity (97\%), COD (82\%) and total phosphate
   (95\%) than that by either lime alone (82, 52 and 79\%) or ferric
   chloride (93, 68 and 92\%) treatment. The study demonstrated the
   potential benefits of a lime-manganese sulphate combination in municipal

Abstract = {{The impact of acid mine drainage (AMD) on lotic receiving waters is

   of AMD contamination of lotic systems appear to be the brownish-yellow
   precipitates of iron (III) hydroxide, high densities of chironomids, and
   the absence of macrophytes. Using these observations a simple index
   based on the degree of deposition of ochre on the river substrate, and
   the level of hoc formation, has been devised. The index is purely a
   descriptive one and is calculated rapidly using a visual inspection of
   individual sites. The derived index values are related to the biological

Abstract = {{Success of two-phase anaerobic systems for primary and secondary sludge

   determine whether phase separation increases directly measured VS
   reduction compared to conventional anaerobic sludge digestion. Two-phase
   and conventional digesters were operated with sludge feeds from three
   sources; both 1:1 sludges (primary:waste activated, solids basis) and
   100\% waste activated sludges (WAS) were studied. The maximum difference
   between VS reductions in conventional and two-phase systems was about
   8.7\% with waste activated sludge. The increase in volatile solids
   reduction in two-phase systems with the 1:1 sludge ranged from 1.9 to
   6.0\% as compared to conventional systems. This relatively small
   increase in VS reduction may not be worth the additional cost of
   operating two-phase digesters at full scale. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{The flocculation of polystyrene particles in a stirred tank was studied
   at various shear rates (63-129 s(-1)) and aluminum sulfate, Al-2(SO4)(3)
   16H(2)O, flocculant concentrations. The competition between coagulation
   and fragmentation during shear-induced flocculation determined the
   equilibrium or steady state particle (floc) structure and size
   distribution. The evolution of the hoc structure with time was monitored
   by image analysis of digitized flee images. The average hoc structure
   became less open or irregular as the flee size distribution attained
   steady state as a result of shear-induced breakage/restructuring. At
   high alum (flocculant) concentrations, the steady state flee size
   distribution appeared to be self-preserving with respect to shear rate.
   In contrast, at lower flocculant concentrations, the steady state hoc
   size distribution narrowed with increasing shear rate as the large tail
   of the distribution was pushed to smaller particle sizes by
   shear-induced fragmentation. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied the impact of a wastewater treatment plant (WTP)
   effluent on a freshwater biofilm autochtonous bacterial microflora
   (Nitrobacter sp.). Physicochemical parameters showed drastic changes
   after wastewater discharge in the river: decrease of dissolved oxygen
   concentration, increase of N-NH4+ as well as dissolved organic nitrogen
   and dissolved organic carbon. Nevertheless the standard conditions of
   nitrification (pH, temperature, oxygen level) downstream of the
   discharge point were not limiting for the nitrification process. The
   benthic Nitrobacter populations, involved in the nitrification process,
   changed qualitatively and quantitatively after the WTP discharge.
   Immunofluorescence labelling techniques allowed us to identify 6
   different serotypes (AG, DE30, DE11, X14, LL and W) and our surveys
   showed important variations of their relative abundance. WTP discharges
   represented great quantities of Nitrobacter (from 10(6) to 10(8) cells .
   ml(-1)) according to the serotypes which were all present in the
   effluent. The definition of a qualitative serotype index showed that the
   Nitrobacter serotype biodiversity upstream of the WTP discharge was
   constant all year long: the downstream biodiversity was likely linked to
   the wastewater input and to its consequent environmental disruptions.

Abstract = {{This work describes the possibility of application of a biosorption
   system with granulated activated carbon (GAG) for the tertiary treatment
   of oil-field brine. In addition to the dissolved and dispersed oil, the
   oil-field brine contained about 29 g/l of mineral matter, mainly NaCl.
   The investigation was carried out on two columns, each containing 300 g
   of GAG. To form the biofilm on GAC use was made of the microorganisms
   from the setup for the purification of refinery wastewaters by activated
   sludge procedure. The wastewater flow-rate through the columns was 40,
   70, 95 and 130 l/d. It was found that the activated carbon in the
   columns was capable of removing 2.6 times more organic matter than was
   its adsorption capacity, and its adsorption power was not thus
   exhausted. The results indicate that the microorganisms present in the
   biofilm on activated carbon oxidize the adsorbed pollutants and thus
   regenerate the carbon surface. The procedure employed was very
   efficient-the organic matter content in the effluent did not exceed 2.5
   mg/l (BOD5). Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents some new results on the aerobic degradation of
   dichloromethane (DCM) and 1,2-dichloroethane (DCA) in a fluidized bed
   reactor without direct oxygenation. Oxygen was supplied by diffusion
   through a synthetic membrane. High bacteria concentrations and high
   degradation rates were obtained. DCM degradation reached 1400 mg (1
   h)(-1) and DCA degradation up to 600 mg (1 h)(-1). Yields for oxygen
   consumption and biomass production could be established. Haldane
   kinetics were suitable to describe the influence of DCA and oxygen
   concentration on the degradation rate of DCA. The DCM degradation rate
   is only influenced by the substrate concentration. Kinetic parameters
   for the Haldane model were reached in batch and extended-culture
   experiments. Extended-culture experiments keep the substrate
   concentration in the reactor constant and allow a determination of the
   growth rate by evaluation of the reaction volume. Copyright (C) 1996

   carbon-substrate utilization assay. Several extraction procedures for
   separating microbial cells from the dark colloidal samples, including
   culture enrichment, homogenization, gravel agitation and sonication,
   were evaluated in order to overcome interference with colour development
   in the assay. Optimal microbial recovery was achieved by homogenization
   in the presence of deflocculating agents, sodium pyrophosphate and Tween
   80. Principal component analysis was used to differentiate among the
   microbial communities in the wastewater treatment systems. Biomass
   obtained from each of the reactors displayed different composite
   metabolic profiles suggesting a unique indigenous microbial population
   in each system. Characterization of separate bacterial and protozoal
   components of one community also showed that each fraction displayed
   different substrate utilization patterns. Substitution of the already
   prepared BIOLOG panel substrates with individual chemicals typically
   associated with BKME allowed for the determination of biodegradation
   potential in wastewater treatment systems. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A mathematical model with time-varying parameters was developed to
   describe the dynamic behavior of the anaerobic mesophilic digestion of
   animal waste. Batch and continuous cases were considered. In the case of
   continuous process linearized models were proposed. Special emphasis was
   given to the parameters identification. Using sensitivity analysis and
   optimization software a simple methodology was developed. The model
   verification and validation were made with different sets of laboratory
   experimental data. Simulated results were in good agreement with
   experimental data under different operating strategies. The model
   proposed in this paper (with its linearized and with reduced order
   modifications) can be used for process control. Copyright (C) 1996

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The high molecular weight (HMW) fraction (>1000Da) of bleached kraft
   mill effluent (BKME) is the principal source of adsorbable organic
   halide (AOX), colour and chemical oxygen demand in treated effluent. The
   influence of HMW material on the microbial activity of activated sludge
   microorganisms was studied in a series of batch growth experiments using
   fractionated effluent. The HMW material in the untreated effluent
   comprised 80\% of the AOX but only 20\% of the soluble GOD. Multivalent
   metal ions had a greater affinity for this HMW fraction. The addition of
   HMW material to the LMW fraction had a stimulatory effect on microbial
   activity as measured by increases in biomass and substrate utilization.
   Chemical characterization and subsequent growth experiments revealed
   that nitrogen, which was deficient in the LMW effluent, was primarily
   associated with the HMW material. The association of nitrogen with the
   HMW fraction may have an important role on the behaviour of nitrogen
   within a biological treatment system and in the receiving environment.

   elution with methanol/phosphate buffer. The fractions, having K-ow > 3,
   were derivatized, and after cleanup by open-column chromatography on
   silica gel, subjected to CC-MS analysis for identification. Compounds

Abstract = {{Survival of the fish pathogens Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida,
   Vibrio anguillarum, and Yersinia ruckeri, when subjected to various
   post-u.v. irradiation treatments, was investigated in a laboratory model
   system. In A. salmonicida, 99.9\% inactivation doses had to be increased
   from (a) 3.2 mWs cm(-2) in the case of no post-irradiation recovery
   treatment to (b) 8.1 mWs cm(-2) if liquid holding in nutrient-free
   buffer in the dark for 48 h was applied before plating, (c) 9.5 mWs
   cm(-2) with visible light illumination at 1500 1x for 8 h and (d) 10.6
   mWs cm(-2) with illumination followed by liquid holding. The
   corresponding figures for V. anguillarum were 2.8, 8.1, 6.3 and 13.4 mWs
   cm(-2) and for Y. ruckeri 1.2, 5.3, 4.9 and 8.5 mWs cm(-2). On combined
   treatment, the latter two species Showed distinct plateaus of no or very
   low sensitivities to increased irradiation doses, while this feature was
   not evident in A. salmonicida. Complete liquid holding recovery demanded
   from 48 to more than 72 h at 22 degrees C, while photoreactivation was
   completed within 4-6 h in all three species at the same temperature. If
   illumination intensity was reduced from 1500 to 150 1x, recovery time
   was approximately doubled in A. salmonicida. During post-irradiation
   dark incubation photoreactivating capacity was lost within approximately
   15 h. It is concluded that the potential of fish pathogenic bacteria for
   liquid holding recovery and photoreactivation should be taken into
   consideration when assessing the efficiency of u.v. disinfection of
   aquacultural water. Particular concern should be aimed at recovery
   processes after discharge to recipient water. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{Effluents from the three largest WWTPs in Sweden were analysed for the
   presence of organic pollutants by GC-MS. From a total of 137 identified
   compounds only 10 were priority pollutants. A broad spectrum of
   non-regulated organic pollutants found in the effluents included
   aromatic hydrocarbons, food and household related compounds, solvents,
   plasticisers, flame retardants, preservatives, antioxidants and washing
   and cleaning related compounds. The concentrations of individual
   compounds in effluents of all three WWTPs were in the range of 0.5-50 mu
   g/l. Rather few point-discharged pollutants from specific industries
   were present in the effluents. The majority of pollutants detected in
   the effluents were attributable to the overall usage and discharge of
   chemical products in modern society. These pollutants originate from
   diffuse sources and represent `'a background chemical pollution load''
   of the receiving waters through the discharge from WWTPs in large
   cities. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Changes of particulate and dissolved fatty acids and sterols were
   studied during an in vitro experiment on the degradation, in seawater,
   of organic matter of urban effluent origin. Incubation of
   seawater-effluent mixture was done in dark at 15 degrees C and the fatty
   acids and sterols were analysed by HPLC and GC. Decomposition of total
   fatty acids and sterols was rapid, with a loss of 90\% in the former and
   70\% in the latter during the first week. Over two months, 95\% of both
   groups were decomposed. Fractionation showed that the dissolved and
   particulate neutral lipids which are representative of anthropogenic
   inputs were rapidly degraded, whereas polar lipids, containing bacterial
   fatty acids initially and polyunsaturated fatty acids later, were
   synthesized. A synthesis of sterols (cholesterol and beta sitosterol)
   was also observed, especially in the dissolved fraction. These
   variations are related to successive development of bacterial and
   bacteriophagal populations. The sterols, and particularly the 5
   beta-stanols, appear to be good tracers for organic matter of urban
   effluents decomposing in the coastal environment. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{In an earlier study {[}Pichat et al. (1993) Photocatalytic Purification
   and Treatment of Water and Air, pp. 207-223. Elsevier, Amsterdam] the
   photocatalytic degradability over TiO2 of some chlorophenols in water
   was correlated to the 1-octanol-water partition coefficient (K-ow) and
   to the Hammett constant (a) of these compounds. To determine whether a
   similar correlation can be found for less closely structurally related
   aromatic pollutants, the case of methoxybenzenes (anisoles) substituted
   at the meta or para positions by F, Cl, NO2, OH, NH2 groups was
   investigated. The Hammett constant, sigma, the Brown constant sigma(+)
   and the ionization potential were successively used as descriptors for
   the electron availability of these compounds. The best correlation was
   log k(app) = 0.20 log K-ow - 0.20 sigma(+) - 0.033 MR - 0.43 (r = 0.903)
   where k(app) (in min(-1)) is the pseudo-first order rate constant of the
   pollutant disappearance in TiO2 aqueous suspensions and MR is the molar
   refractivity of the pollutant. With respect to sigma, sigma(+) has the
   interest of introducing a greater difference between the meta and para
   derivatives. MR, which is proportional to the polarizability, is thought
   to reflect the pollutant-pollutant interaction and to amend the effect
   of K-ow in accounting for the distribution of the pollutant molecules in
   the TiO2-water system. This descriptor induces much smaller differences
   between the various anisoles than K-ow and, above all, sigma(+). The
   validity of methods to evaluate K-ow when experimental values are not
   available or MR when the refractive index is unknown, is also discussed.

Abstract = {{A new method has been developed to remove arsenite and arsenate ions
   from aquatic systems by using basic yttrium carbonate (BYC). Various
   parameters such as pH, anion concentration and reaction time were
   studied to establish optimum conditions. The removal by adsorption of
   arsenite and arsenate ions was found to be > 99\% depending on initial
   concentration in the pH range of 9.8-10.5 and 7.5-9.0, respectively. The
   arsenate was also removed by precipitation at pH lower than 6.5 due to
   dissolution of BYC. The kinetic study shows that the adsorption follows
   the first order reaction. The adsorption isotherms of these anions were
   also studied at different temperatures. The equilibrium data fit well in
   the Langmuir model of adsorption. The Langmuir constants were calculated
   at different temperatures and the adsorption capacity for both anions
   increases with temperature. Anions such as Cl-, Br-, I-, NO3- and SO42-
   have no interference in the removal process. The mechanism of the
   removal by adsorption was interpreted in terms of the surface charge and
   ligand orientation of BYC. The method was applied on synthetic
   wastewaters. Arsenite was oxidized to arsenate by 3\% hydrogen peroxide.
   The yttrium was regenerated as basic yttrium carbonate. Copyright (C)

Title = {{Mechanism of salicylic acid precipitation by Fe(III) coagulation}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1149-1160}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The general objective of our work is to study the precipitation
   mechanism of organic matter by iron salts. The elimination of aromatic
   acids by coagulation with iron was found to depend on the number and the
   position of acid functions on the aromatic cycle. Only compounds which
   present at least two COOH and/or OH functions in ortho position were
   significantly removed by iron(III) coagulation (Lefebvre and Legube,
   1993). The objective of the present paper is to precise the mechanisms
   of interaction between salicylic acid (and its isomers) and iron as well
   as to evaluate the part of complexation reactions. All experiments were
   carried out with a jar-test apparatus which was described in a previous
   publication (Lefebvre and Legube, 1990). The coagulation was carried out
   at 250 r.p.m. for 15 min, the slow agitation (floculation) was carried
   out at 30 r.p.m. for 30 min, 2 h were chosen for the sedimentation.
   After filtration on 0.2 mu m-membrane, the following analyses were
   performed: dissolved organic carbon (DOG), analysis of aromatic
   compounds by HPLC, measurement of u.v.-visible absorbance, analysis of
   iron by orthophenanthroline-spectrophotometric method (dissolved iron)
   and by atomic absorption spectrometry (total iron).
   The main results presented in this paper are:
   (i) The removal of salicylic acid by coagulation with iron was optimal
   for pH values of about 5.5 {[}Fig. 1(B)] where this removal increased
   with the increasing coagulant dose {[}Fig. 1(A)]. Furthermore, at pH 3.5
   (Table 1), one could notice appearance of an absorbance band at 525 nm
   and a significant difference between results of DOC and HPLC analyses
   for weak molar ratios. At pH 5.5 (Table 2), the difference between both
   determination technics of salicylic acid (DOG and HPLC) was significant
   only for a salicylic acid/iron molar ratio above 0.8. This difference
   between the two analytical methods was mainly observed with the samples
   containing residual iron and which presented a 483 nm-band on the
   visible spectra. At pH 8.5 (Table 3) the precipitation of iron was
   predominant, which can explain the weak removal of the compound.
   (ii) The relative position of hydroxyl and carboxyl functions on the
   aromatic ring of hydroxy-benzoic acid was found to be very important.
   Indeed, the removal of 3-hydroxybenzoic (meta position) and
   4-hydroxybenzoic (para position) acids were found to be much lower than
   salicylic acid. Moreover, the organic matter/iron molar ratio for
   coagulation, at pH 5.5, of the two salicylic acid isomers had no effect
   either on the elimination of the compounds nor on the solubility of iron
   (Tables 5 and 6).
   We conclude from these results and some others (stoichiometry of the
   complex formation in Fig. 7, effect of pH on the complex stability in
   Fig. 8) that precipitation of salicylic acid by coagulation with iron is
   firstly the consequence of the initial formation of a soluble complex
   with a 1/1 stoichiometry. The formation of this soluble complex was
   particularly easy to observe at acidic pH and for high salicylic
   acid/iron molar ratios. The complex stability is due to the bidentate
   nature of the salicylate ligand, considering the fact that there was
   evidently no formation of such a complex from meta and para isomers of
   salicylic acid and only a weak precipitation of these compounds was
   observed.
   Secondly, increase of pH leads to hydrolysis of the complex by the
   partial replacement of salicylic acid with hydroxide ions. During the
   hydrolysis, the maximum of the absorption band of spectra was found to
   shift (483 nm at pH 5.5 instead of 525 nm at pH 3.5), then to disappear
   when pH values are nearly neutral. This hydrolysis leads only to a
   partial precipitation of the organic compounds, even for optimal pH
   values (around 5.5). Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Empirical bromate formation models were developed from observed batch
   ozonation data to simulate the effects of important water quality
   characteristics and treatment processes on bromate formation. Data
   generated from true batch ozonation studies with an orthogonal matrix
   design, served as the base for development of empirical models for
   bromate formation. The variables examined include pH, initial bromide
   concentration, alkalinity, ozone dose, ammonia and dissolved organic
   carbon level. This array of variables was selected to evaluate the
   effects bf important water quality characteristics and treatment
   processes on the formation of bromate ion during water ozonation.
   Limited temperature variation data were also generated. Isolation and
   fractionation of natural organic matter (NOM) by ultrafiltration and
   reverse osmosis membrane techniques allowed assessment of source water
   variations and the role of molecular size on bromate formation. Multiple
   linear regression of logarithmic transformations was used to generate
   the models. Results obtained from the empirical models indicate that
   bromate formation is favored at high pH, initial bromide concentration,
   alkalinity and high ozone dose. On the other hand, increasing DOC and
   ammonia concentration decreased bromate formation. The models also
   indicated that NOM isolated from different water sources have a strong
   influence on bromate formation upon ozonation of model solutions
   composed of different membrane isolates. Both internal and external
   validation of the models demonstrated that the bromate models predicted
   bromate formation well. Finally, the models indicated that acid addition
   (pH depression) strategies can be used to control bromate formation.

Abstract = {{Sensitized photocatalysis has been demonstrated with colored pollutants
   such as nitrophenols. With visible light excitation of an adsorbed
   nitrophenol, charge injection into the conduction band of the
   semiconductor occurs and subsequent transformation of nitrophenols is
   possible. This work reports the results of experiments of direct and
   sensitized photocatalysis of 4-nitrophenol using an annular reactor,
   TiO2, and an artificial light source. The extent of 4-nitrophenol
   degradation was determined in order to assess mechanistic differences
   between direct and sensitized photocatalysis. Three major aromatic
   intermediates were identified for both types of
   photocatalysis-4-nitrocatechol, hydroquinone, and benzenetriol-but the
   reaction pathway and distribution of these intermediates are dependent
   on the photocatalytic mechanism. Nitrite, nitrate, and ammonium ions
   were analyzed to determine the participation of oxidation vs reduction
   in the degradation pathway. The systems were also analyzed under Nr
   atmosphere to determine the role of oxygen in the degradation pathway of
   4-nitrophenol. The results presented herein verify those observed in
   powder systems indicating that sensitization in aqueous systems with a
   low 4-nitrophenol:semiconductor concentration achieves partial
   destruction of the parent compound and denitration. It is thought that
   these chemical transformations may enhance the biodegradability of
   nitroaromatic compounds, suggesting that sensitized photocatalysis has
   the potential to be used as a pretreatment process in combination with
   biological treatment. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The growth and biodegradation kinetics of Mycobacterium chlorophenolicus
   comb nov. was studied in a series of batch experiments in the laboratory
   to identify and quantify the significant factors for its bioreactor
   performance. A mathematical model was formulated taking into account the
   degradation of primary and secondary substrate, as well as the growth of
   nonspecific and specific biomass. Using model parameters determined by
   the batch tests, the model was validated by simulations of a continuous
   flow experiment with bioaugmentation of the PCP-degrading culture in 2
   activated sludge systems. A novel technique using immunofluorescence
   microscopy for quantifying the pure culture made it possible to evaluate
   the specific PCP degradation rates related to the PCP-degrading culture.
   The comparisons showed an excellent agreement for the total PCP removal,
   although there were some over- and underestimations of sorption and
   biodegradation as individual removal processes. The specific first order
   biodegradation rate constants were about 3 times higher in the
   bioaugmented systems that in batch experiments with the added culture
   alone. Even rough estimates for specific biodegradation rate constants
   may give meaningful predictions of the fate of specific organic
   compounds in wastewater treatment processes. For practical engineering
   and management purposes this may in many cases be adequate. The study
   highlighted the importance of reporting operating conditions in
   experiments from which biodegradation kinetic parameters such as Y,mu(m)
   and K-s were derived. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a steady-state biofilm model is applied for modeling
   substrate removal by plug-flow bioreactors in biological water
   treatment. The model is used with assimilable organic carbon (AOC) data
   from a previous pilot scale study to estimate the essential physical and
   kinetic parameters required for designing biological water treatment
   processes. The successful fitting of the model to the data demonstrates
   the applicability of this modeling approach for water treatment and that
   AOC can be used as at least a surrogate for the overall biodegradable
   organic matter. The model is used to obtain process insights. It is
   shown that there is an approximately linear relationship between
   substrate removal and influent concentration. For a plug-flow packed bed
   bioreactor, a quantity designated as the dimensionless empty bed contact
   time, X{*}, is defined. The slope of the linear relationship,
   representing the approximate percentage removal of the substrate, is
   shown to be mainly determined by X{*}. Percentage removal increases
   convexly with increasing X{*}, however beyond a certain value of X{*},
   further increases achieve little improvement. Other dimensionless
   parameters affect the convexity of the curve. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{Model solutions were used to evaluate the effect of dissolved silica on
   the mineralogy and stability of Fe(II) oxidation products. Mineralogy
   was evaluated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray
   diffraction. Stability was evaluated by measuring the decrease in
   turbidity of colloidal suspensions with time. At Si/Fe molar ratios of
   0.1 or less, oxidation of Fe(II) produced lepidocrocite, a moderately
   crystalline oxide that settled rapidly out of solution. At Si/Fe molar
   ratios of 0.36 or higher, ferrihydrite formed from the oxidation of
   Fe(II). The ferrihydrite consisted of 0.1 mu m spherical particles that
   were poorly crystalline and increasingly stable with higher Si/Fe molar
   ratios. The ferrihydrite was similar in structure and composition to Fe
   oxide colloids isolated from two natural samples: (1) a reduced
   groundwater sample that was allowed to oxidize in the laboratory and (2)
   the colloidal particles in the < 1.0 mu m Size class of surface water
   samples from the Tualatin River watershed in northwest Oregon. The
   similarity of the natural and synthetic colloids is evidence that Fe
   oxide colloids in natural waters can result from the oxidation of Fe(II)
   and that dissolved silica may contribute to the stability of the
   colloids. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The extrapolation of single-species laboratory studies to natural
   communities is one of the problems encountered when carrying out risk
   assessment of chemicals in the environment. This is especially
   applicable to extrapolation problems where mixtures of chemicals are
   involved. To investigate whether the laboratory-derived mixture toxicity
   approach is valid under field conditions, a mesocosm experiment was set
   up in which a laboratory strain of Daphnia magna was added to a natural,
   fresh water plankton community and exposed to three levels of a metal
   mixture. The mixtures, composed of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper,
   mercury, lead, nickel and zinc, were characterized by the sum of toxic
   units of dissolved metal concentrations (Sigma TUdis), on the basis of
   EC(50) values obtained in a laboratory study (Enserink et al., 1991).
   Only a small part of the metals (about one quarter) was present in
   dissolved form, the remainder was bound to particulate matter. The Sigma
   TUdis remained constant throughout the experiment. On the basis of the
   population development (integrated density), an EC(50) of 0.83 Sigma
   TUdis was calculated for D. magna. All other dominant cladoceran species
   were more sensitive than D. magna, with EC(50) values of 0.53 Sigma
   TUdis for Ceriodaphnia spp. and 0.60 Sigma TUdis for D. cucullata
   respectively. Copepods were less sensitive (0.98 Sigma TUdis) and
   rotifers were about as sensitive as cladocerans. Significant
   bioconcentration factors could be calculated for arsenic, nickel, lead
   and mercury. Toxic effects on zooplankton resulted in elevated
   phytoplankton biomass due to reduced grazing. Only rotifer species were
   able to benefit from extra food availability, but could not prevent
   phytoplankton blooms from forming. It is concluded that, although the
   relative importance of the individual metals and the physico-chemical
   conditions in the natural plankton community differs from laboratory
   test conditions, the toxic effects on D. magna are about comparable, and
   that some dominant naturally present cladoceran species are more
   sensitive than D. magna. Copyright (C) 1996 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{A simple measuring system was developed that yields information about
   the presence of NH4+ and NO2- nitrogen in mixed liquor samples. In
   addition, it allows monitoring of the rate of both NH4+ and NO2-
   oxidation simultaneously with the carbon substrate oxidation using OUR
   measurements. The method is based on the subsequent addition of NaClO3
   and allylthiourea, selective inhibitors of Nitrobacter and Nitrosomonas
   respectively, to the mixed liquor sample in a closed batch respirometer.
   The presented method is valuable for detailed monitoring of the
   nitrification process in a reactor: it is simple, inexpensive, robust
   and generally applicable for nitrifying reactor systems. The measurement
   of NH4+ and NO2- oxidation rates enables the operator to detect the
   presence of NH4+ and NO2- species. This allows action to be taken to
   improve the performance of the system. The method is validated on a SBR.
   It is indicated that optimal SBR phase scheduling can be based on such
   OUR measurements. Copyright (C) 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A statistical procedure has been developed to quantify the mortality
   response of caged macroinvertebrates in terms of measured environmental
   parameters. Populations of Gammarus pulex and Asellus aquaticus were
   caged in urban receiving waters downstream of a combined sewer overflow
   (CSO) and a surface water outfall (SWO) for 36 d. During this period of
   exposure, the mortality and heavy metal bioaccumulation responses of
   populations of both species, as well as seventeen different chemical and
   hydrological characteristics of the receiving watercourse were
   monitored. Multivariate statistical techniques, comprising principal
   component analysis (with VARIMAX rotation) and multiple regression
   analysis were used to determine the measured variables that influenced
   mortality. Certain parameters (BOD5, total aqueous copper concentration,
   flow rate and suspended solids) influenced the mortality responses of
   both species. Ammonia, total aqueous lead concentrations and dissolved
   aqueous concentrations of zinc and copper additionally affected the
   response of Gammarus pulex. Body concentrations of zinc, lead, cadmium
   and copper and dissolved aqueous concentrations of cadmium were found to
   be influential upon the mortality response of caged Asellus aquaticus.
   The relationships between the mortality responses of each species and
   the selected independent variables are expressed in the form of stable
   quantitative equations by regressing the dependent variable (ie
   mortality) against the principal components of the independent
   parameters. This statistical approach represents an important tool for
   interpreting large intercorrelated sets of environmental data obtained
   in situ. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have identified the first Bush phenomenon as being a
   relatively high load of pollutants in the initial phases of combined
   sewer flow. In systems without storage, this first Bush of pollutants
   may be discharged from the system and result in the heavy pollution of
   the receiving watercourse. However, by the inclusion of a storage tank,
   this first Bush can be retained and the effluent be discharged in a
   controlled manner. To optimise the storage volume, both the total
   pollutant load discharged and the temporal variation in pollutant
   concentration within an event need to be predicted. Sophisticated models
   like QSIM and MOUSETRAP to predict the pollutants in urban sewer hows
   are already available. However, the data requirements for these models
   are extensive, which usually limit their application to major or
   environmentally sensitive schemes. This paper describes the development
   of site specific regressional relationships to predict the first flush
   load of suspended solids in combined sewer flow and these may be used
   for storage tank design. Data from two sites at Great Harwood and
   Clayton-le-Moors in the Northwest of England has been used to develop
   predictive equations which relate the first Bush load of suspended
   solids and the hydrological parameters most likely to influence sewer
   flow quality. A multiple stepwise linear regression technique has been
   utilised for this purpose. The maximum rainfall intensity, maximum
   inflow, rainfall duration and the antecedent dry weather period were
   found to be the most important parameters influencing the first flush
   load of suspended solids. The equations were verified using an
   independent set of data and gave good predictions of the first flush
   load for the sites considered. This study has the limitation that the
   equations are catchment specific. However, as more data for different
   catchments becomes available, it may be possible to establish standard
   coefficients for application to a wide range of catchment conditions.

Abstract = {{The phenomena of biomass loss during reactor startup and steady-state
   operation of an anaerobic fluidized bed (AFB) reactor using porous media
   particles and fed with acetic acid are studied. The amount of biomass
   lost during reactor startup is found to be correlated to both substrate
   utilization and biogas production. However, the level of biomass lost
   does not impede reactor startup and a rapid buildup of attached biomass
   in the reactor is attainable. Under the fluidization conditions commonly
   found in steady-state AFB reactors, mechanical attrition caused by

Abstract = {{To determine the extent of phosphorus (P) enrichment of the major rivers
   in England and Wales, a proportion of the large archive of data held by
   the National Rivers Authority on river orthophosphate concentrations was
   collated and statistical summaries produced. Length of sampling record,
   sampling frequency and method of analysis was not consistant for all
   rivers, but median orthophosphate concentrations for 98 rivers ranged
   from < 0.01 to 7.85 mg/l. Median concentrations exceeded 0.1 mg/l in 78
   of the rivers and 1.0 mg/l in 16 rivers. Orthophosphate concentrations
   were largest in highly urbanised catchments and in some rural catchments
   with low flow rates, and smallest in rural upland catchments and other
   high rainfall areas. Estimated loadings of orthophosphate were < 1 kg/ha
   in 50\% of rivers. Where total P data were available, orthophosphate was
   the dominant form of P present. Mean monthly orthophosphate
   concentrations derived for 20 of the rivers increased slowly during
   summer to reach a maximum between July and November and decreased
   quickly over winter to reach a minimum between January and April.
   Similar temporal trends were observed in long-term time series for
   individual rivers. Limited linear regression analysis indicated that
   orthophosphate concentrations had significantly increased over the last
   20 years in some rivers. Reductions in orthophoshate levels in other
   rivers could be related to recent attempts to control sources of P
   inputs. Comparison of two different rural catchments demonstrated that
   the distribution of sewage treatment works and river flow
   characteristics had a major influence on the spatial variation of river
   orthophosphate concentrations in catchments. Although the data Were more
   representative of base flow conditions and therefore probably
   underestimate the contribution from agriculture, it can be concluded
   that the widespread P enrichment of rivers in England and Wales is
   largely due to point source P inputs. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fresh chemithermomechanical (CTMP) mill primary clarifier (combined)
   effluents were treated using a system capable of accurately applying
   small measured charges of ozone. It was shown that the efficiency of
   ozone transfer into effluent was much better than into water, and that
   there was no residual dissolved ozone. Small ozone charges destroyed
   high proportions of the total resin and fatty acids (RFAs) and
   juvabiones (JBs) present in the effluents. This effect diminished with
   increasing ozone charges. Likewise, effluent toxicity, as measured in
   the Microtox assay, decreased rapidly with the low ozone charges. The
   low charges of ozone were also shown to be effective in destroying both
   soluble and particulate RFAs. It was shown that there was a strong
   positive correlation between the RFA content and the acute toxicity of
   an effluent sample, and that all the acute toxicity was extractable with
   methyl-t-butyl ether. Both Microtox and Daphnia magna acute toxicity
   assays correlated with effluent RFA content, but the Microtox was
   somewhat more sensitive. Thus, ozone may be a useful economical
   treatment agent for selectively removing RFAs and toxicity from mill
   effluent streams. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{To identify mechanisms by which Ca(OH)(2) additions reduce phytoplankton
   biomass in the short term (<20 d), we investigated changes in
   concentrations of chlorophyll a (chi a), total phosphorus (TP) and
   calcium (Ca), and pH and turbidity in four eutrophic hardwater lakes,
   two dugouts and limnocorrals. We also tested the potential effects of
   high pH and turbidity on biomass of three representative species of
   planktonic cyanobacteria, green algae and diatoms in the laboratory.
   When chi a concentrations were higher than 10 mu g . l(-1), Ca(OH)(2)
   additions with dosages ranging from 25 to 87 mg . l(-1) decreased chi a
   concentrations by 80\% in lakes. Chi a concentrations were also reduced
   by adding 50, 75 or 100 mg . l(-1) Ca(OH)(2) to limnocorrals and 250 mg
   . l(-1) Ca(OH)(2) to dugouts. Transitory high pH and turbidity did not
   reduce phytoplanton biomass in the laboratory. The pH in limnocorrals
   and dugouts increased to >10, which may have affected phytoplankton
   biomass. After treatment, TP concentrations declined in limnocorrals and
   dugouts, but not always in lakes. In lakes and dugouts, Ca
   concentrations >30 mg . l(-1) or pH levels >10 were related to <10 mu g
   . l(-1) chi a. In lakes, pH was always <10 due to the inherently high
   buffering capacity, and the reduced phytoplankton biomass coincided with
   decreased Ca concentrations; therefore, precipitation of phytoplankton
   cells likely caused the short-term reduction in chi a. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Three macrophytes are found to grow well in trenches filled with a
   secondary effluent of a wastewater treatment plant in the absence of any
   support medium: Canna, Cyperus and Paspalum. Daily concentration changes
   of nutrients in the wastewater as well as evapotranspiration of the
   macrophytes were studied batchwise. After the vegetation had covered the
   trenches fully, the plants removed daily, 1.2-2.6 g of total nitrogen,
   0.24-0.33 g of phosphate-phosphorus and 0.3-0.9 g of sulphate-sulphur
   per sq m. While ammonium and phosphate concentrations always decreased
   in water, sulphate was found to increase due to evapotranspiration. The
   daily water losses due to the latter was up to 20 l . m(-2) on sunny
   days. It was found that for extended nutrient removal under these
   conditions a hydroponic tertiary treatment plant could possibly produce
   no effluent at all. After harvesting, the aerial parts of the plant
   tissue contained comparable ash contents of 0.8-0.95\% on wet base.
   Elementary analysis showed similar N and P contents of 23-26 g/kg and
   2.3-3.8 g/kg respectively and differences in some inorganic elements of
   up to an order of magnitude between the three plants. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{The oxidation behaviour of gentisic acid, from which a humic acid model
   was synthesized, was studied. Electrochemical investigation coupled with
   Electron Spin Resonance analysis revealed the complexity of the
   mechanism. Coupled chemical reactions appeared after the two electron
   oxidation, leading to trihydroxybenzoic acids, and to dimeric compounds.
   The presence of methylenic groups, particularly important to mimic the
   flexibility and aggregative properties of natural humic substance, was
   confirmed. Assuming a free radical mechanism for the chemical evolution
   of humic substances, metal ions could help the reaction process, leading
   to efficient spin-trapping matters to be considered in water treatments.

Abstract = {{A non-adsorptive method was rested for the concentration and
   fractionation of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) in groundwater. Reverse
   osmosis combined with ultrafiltration recovered more than 90\% of the
   DOC and efficiently separated the DOC into three size fractions. Unlike
   adsorptive methods, this procedure avoids the use of strong acids and
   bases that may alter the structure of the DOG. A diafiltration method
   was applied during ultrafiltration that gave good separation of the DOC
   into high-, medium-, and low-molecular-size fractions. The high- and
   medium-molecular-size fractions are desalted during this fractionation
   procedure and can be further analyzed for individual compounds. The
   inorganic solutes remain in the low-molecular-size fraction. Future
   advances in ultrafiltration membrane technology may facilitate removal
   of inorganic ions without significant loss of low-molecular-size organic
   acids. Studies on a synthetic groundwater showed that the combined
   reverse osmosis/ultrafiltration method is viable for the concentration
   and fractionation of a wide range in organic compounds typically found
   in groundwater. Copyright (C) 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   chloride and sulphate salts of iron and aluminum were effective in
   treating the mechanical pulping effluent in batch jar screening tests.
   pH had a pronounced affect on precipitation. In terms of minimizing the
   total carbon (TC), colour and turbidity levels, the optimum adjusted pH
   ranges were: 4.0-6.5 for ferric chloride, above 7.4 for ferrous
   sulphate, 5.0-6.0 for aluminum chloride and 5.8 to 6.8 for aluminum
   sulphate. Removal of TC, colour and turbidity of up to 88, 90 and 98\%,
   respectively, were observed. The precipitation yielded a supernatant
   which was virtually clear and colourless.}},

Abstract = {{Pulp and paper effluents contain a number of compounds which are harmful
   to receiving waters and which are inhibitory or recalcitrant to
   biological treatment. Iron and aluminum coagulating agents were
   effective in treating a CTMP/BCTMP pulping effluent in batch jar
   screening tests. For full strength effluent, toxicity was markedly
   reduced by precipitation, with optimal Microtox EC50 values of approx.
   20\% being recorded. Dilution of the effluent followed by precipitation
   further improved toxicity removal, and complete detoxification of a
   strength effluent was observed using ferric chloride as the precipitant.
   At higher than optimal levels of addition, iron and aluminum salts
   contributed to toxicity. The possibility of salt recovery was
   demonstrated through a fixed solids balance. Ferric chloride appeared to
   be the most promising candidate for recovery, with less than 20\% of the
   fixed solids lost to the supernatant.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory scale research on the effects of hydraulic retention time
   (HRT), solids residence time (SRT), high operating temperatures and
   temperature shocks on activated sludge (AS) treatment of kraft pulping
   effluent was performed using two 51 continuously fed bioreactors.
   Baseline performance of the reactors was established at 35 degrees C by
   operating the reactors at steady state (HRT 10-12 h; SRT 12-15 d) for a
   period of two months. During this period percent removal of BOD, GOD,
   and toxicity averaged 87.9 +/- 4.3, 32.4 +/- 9.0, 97.7 +/- 0.4,
   respectively. Reactor MLVSS was 1675 +/- 191 mg/l, effluent VSS was 45.5
   +/- 11.2 mg/l and specific oxygen uptake rate was 16.5 +/- 3.3 mg O-2/g
   MLVSS . h. Varying HRT between 12 and 4 h and SRT between 5 and 15 d
   indicated that HRT had more of an effect on treatment performance than
   SRT. Longer HRTs led to improved BOD, GOD, toxicity and AOX removal,
   while longer SRTs were not shown to significantly affect performance.
   Shorter HRTs and longer SRTs led to significant increases in specific
   oxygen uptake rates (SOURs). For reactors operated at temperatures
   between 41 and 50 degrees C, removal of BOD and acute toxicity was
   comparable to that observed at mesophilic temperatures. COD removal was
   improved over that observed at mesophilic temperatures, possibly as a
   result of improved dissolution of organic compounds at the higher
   temperatures. The effect of temperature shocks (decreases of 7 degrees,
   16.5 degrees, 32 degrees and 40.5 degrees C) on reactor performance was
   proportional to the size of the disturbance. Reactor performance
   returned to pre-shocking levels within 12-24 h for the two smaller
   temperature shocks. Approximately 72 h was needed for the system to
   recover from the two larger temperature shocks (32 degrees and 40.5
   degrees C).}},

Abstract = {{A study on the water quality from the Rio Tercero River was performed
   for 14 months. The aim of the work was not only to assess the control of
   bacteriological, phycological and chemical aspects, but also to measure
   genotoxicity of drinking water and its relation With the water treatment
   technique employed. Bacteriological parameters are negative in general,
   apparently indicating low levels of contaminants. Algae were present in
   the untreated water, especially several diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) and
   potentially hepatotoxin-producing cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). The
   chemical analysis detected arsenic (up to 0.114 mg/l) and vanadium (up

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method for the simultaneous determination of
   inhibition kinetics of both carbon oxidation and nitrification with the
   RODTOX (Rapid Oxygen Demand and TOXicity tester) respirometric
   biosensor. The biokinetic parameters of carbon oxidation and
   nitrification are estimated on the basis of respirometric data obtained
   from batch experiments with pulse injection of a mixture of a readily
   biodegradable carbon (acetic acid) and nitrogen (ammonium chloride)
   source. This estimation is based on a Double Monod mathematical model
   and a nonlinear parameter estimation algorithm. Performing batch tests
   with six to eight different concentrations of a toxic compound allows
   the deduction of the dependence of the kinetic parameters on the
   toxicant concentrations. The time necessary for a complete determination
   of the inhibition kinetics is approx. 8 h. Practical applications of the
   developed method are given.}},

Abstract = {{Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) postmolts weighing 430 +/- 73 g were
   exposed to six different water ammonia levels ranging from about 3
   (control) to 425 mg/l TA-N (total ammonia-N) (0.01-2.78 mg/l NH3-N) in
   aerated seawater at mean levels of 7.2-7.4 mg/l O-2, 6.4-6.6 degrees C,
   34-35 parts per thousand salinity and pH 7.5-7.6 in two replicate static
   48 h tests. Likely due to CO2 excretion by the fish, water pH and NH3-N
   levels generally decreased with time during the tests. During these
   conditions, 48 h-LC(50)s of 59.4 mg/l TA-N (0.34 mg/l NH3-N) and 58.6
   mg/l TA-N (0.24 mg/l NH3-N) were found. Gill ventilation frequency was
   slightly, but significantly increased at exposure to 30.0-56.2 mg/l TA-N
   (0.14-0.30 mg/l NH3-N) in both tests. At higher water ammonia levels,
   ventilation frequency was not measured due to convulsions and panic-like
   bursts of swimming of the acutely intoxicated fish, and a rapid onset of
   a mortality finally reaching 100\%.}},

Abstract = {{A sewage lagoon for 2000-3000 capita (0.6 ha) has been operated
   successfully with a duckweed cover for over four years. The cover
   suppressed algal growth; the effluent turbidity was always below 12 Ntu.
   Because of inappropriate construction, one fifth of the inflow is lost
   by percolation and seepage during the dry season; during the wet season
   the loss is limited. During a detailed sampling period in the dry season
   actual hydraulic retention time was 20.4 d, and surface loading rate was
   48-60 kgBOD(5)/ha . d. Concentration reduction was 90-97\% for COD,
   95-99\% for BOD5, and 74-77\% for Kjeldahl-N and total P. Effluent
   contained 2.7 mg Kjeldahi-N/I and 0.4 mg total P/I. The water column
   remained aerobic. At two-thirds of retention time the plants had
   absorbed virtually all NH4+ and ortho-PO43- from the water column. The
   duckweed harvest would remove in a watertight lagoon 60-80\% of the N
   and P load, or 0.26 gN/m(2) . d and 0.05 gP/m(2) . d (in the first
   three-quarters of retention time). The results during this period were
   representative for the ii-year operation so far. Corrected for the
   leakage, plant productivity under these fertilised and managed
   conditions was sustained for several years at the level of 58-105
   kg(dw)/ha . d, or 715-1200 kg/ha . d (over full lagoon surface) in the
   dry and wet season, respectively. We suggest that the microbial
   hydrolysis of the more complex organic N and P into NH4+ and ortho-PO43-
   is the limiting step for enhanced biomass production.}},

Abstract = {{The equilibrium distribution of Cd, Cu and Pb between the cyanobacterium
   Anabaena spp. and natural lake water as a function of salinity and
   degree of algal decomposition, was studied using batch experiments.
   Adsorption isotherms could be described with the Freundlich equation.
   Distribution coefficients (Kd) for Anabaena spp. were largest for Pb,
   followed by Cd and Cu. The variation in Kd values for Cd was explained
   by a model accounting for metal complexation to the algal surface and
   complexation by dissolved ligands of variable concentration. The
   phytoplankton/water distribution of Cd in waters of different salinity
   appears to be regulated by the free Cd2+ activity in solution.
   Mineralization of Anabaena spp. for 42 d resulted in a decrease of the
   solid to water ratio by a factor of 12, and an increase in K-d for Cd
   (factor four), Cu (factor eight) and Pb (factor 10-20). The increase in
   K-d is attributed to a higher affinity of the metals for the adsorbent.
   The use of constant K-d values for mineralizing phytoplankton and
   detritus in trace metal fate models, may result in underestimations of
   bound fractions. The extent to which this fraction is underestimated,
   depends on the time course of the distribution coefficient and the solid
   to water ratio during the mineralization process.}},

Title = {{Systematic salt effects in the automated determination of nutrients in
   seawater}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{869-874}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The Bran + Luebbe TRAACS continuous flow analyser, commonly used for the
   determination of nutrients in seawater, primarily employs standard
   methods that have been modified and adapted for automated use. The
   analyser is fitted with self aligning spectrophotometric flow-cells with
   parallel optical ends of uniform thickness. As the light beam strikes
   both ends of the flow-cell perpendicularly, there is no refraction
   therefore no spurious absorbance caused by changes in the refractive
   index of the Bow-cell contents. Investigation of methods for the
   determination of ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, orthophosphate, soluble
   reactive silica and urea, using TRAACS, confirmed that this was the
   case. Also, for the methods assessed, the absorbance signal was not
   biased by either sample turbidity or wetting agents. Chemical
   interference from salt was assessed by analysing nutrient spiked
   solutions, over the 0-35 ppt salinity range, relative to working
   calibration solutions prepared using demineralised water. A major salt
   effect which caused an apparent decrease in concentration, was detected
   over the analytical working ranges in the ammonia and nitrate methods.
   The salt effect results from a chemical interference which causes the
   production of reaction products to vary as a function of salinity. The
   salt effect is totally unrelated to refraction and produces a
   concentration error in the ammonia and nitrate methods up to 35 and 25\%
   respectively. The degree of salt effect was shown to be dependent on
   both the salinity and true nutrient concentration of the sample. Over
   the salinity range 8.75-35.00 ppt, corrective equations were derived for
   ammonia and nitrate to express the true nutrient concentration in terms
   of the observed concentration and the salinity of the solution. Within
   the range 0-8.75 ppt no correction was required for ammonia wheras the
   nitrate showed a 3.5\% increase in apparent concentration at 8.75 ppt.
   The orthophosphate, soluble reactive silica, urea and nitrite methods
   showed no significant salt effect as the coefficient of variation (CV)
   of the observed nutrient concentrations over the 0-35 ppt salinity range
   was within the accepted CV or analytical precision of the methods. The
   ammonia and nitrate corrective equations were applied in assessing the
   true nutrient content of `'depleted'' or low nutrient seawater, used in
   the preparation of working calibration solutions, after analysing
   relative to working calibration solutions prepared in demineralised
   water.}},

Abstract = {{Bioregeneration of powdered activated carbon (PAC) loaded with aromatic
   compounds was quantitatively determined using carbon dioxide production
   as a measure of substrate consumption. Two types of powdered activated
   carbon (one chemically activated, wood-based carbon, CA1, and one
   thermally activated, peat-based carbon, SA4) and two aromatic compounds
   (o-cresol and 3-chlorobenzoic acid) in single solute batch systems were
   used. Interaction of EDTA, present as chelating agent in all experiments
   with o-cresol as substrate, and SA4 resulted in abiotic CO, production
   (in absence of microorganisms). The extent of bioregeneration varied
   considerably, from 15 to 85\% of total PAC loading, depending on type of
   PAC used and compound involved and, in one case, on the time of contact
   between PAC and the compound. The results revealed that the data
   corresponded with a mechanism of bioregeneration where desorption
   precedes biodegradation. Microorganisms reduced the dissolved compound
   concentration, forcing desorption and subsequent biodegradation, but
   were unable to influence the desorbability of the PAC-sorbed compounds.
   The practical applicability of the results is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Desorption of sorbed compounds is an important process in the powdered
   activated carbon-activated sludge (PAC-AS) wastewater treatment system,
   where sorption and biodegradation interact. To assess the extent of
   desorption to be expected in the PAC-AS system, reversibility of
   adsorption was investigated using isotherm studies and a leaching
   technique under the conditions prevalent in the PAC-AS system. Two
   aromatic compounds, o-cresol and 3-chlorobenzoic acid (3-CB), and two
   types of powdered activated carbon (PAC) were used to study desorption.
   High degrees of irreversible adsorption were observed with both
   desorption techniques, depending on the type of PAC and the compound.
   The thermally activated, peat-based PAC (SA4) showed a high degree of
   irreversible adsorption compared to the chemically activated,
   wood-derived PAC (CA1). The phenolic compound, o-cresol, could be
   desorbed to a lesser extent than 3-CB from both types of PAC. Contact
   time between the PAC and the compound was found to affect the desorption
   of o-cresol adversely. Oxygen availability enhanced the adsorptive
   capacity of SA4 for o-cresol. Sorption of 3-CB proved unaffected by
   either contact time or oxygen. Oxidative polymerization as a probable
   mechanism for the irreversible adsorption observed is also discussed.
   Desorption kinetics from SA4 showed a first phase of rapid desorption
   followed by a second phase of slow desorption. CA1 displayed the first
   rapid desorption phase only.}},

Abstract = {{Coupled nitrification-denitrification rates in sediments of the shallow
   lake Nuldernauw, The Netherlands, were measured using the N-2 flux
   method and the N-15 isotope pairing technique. It was clarified by
   different checks that the coupled nitrification-denitrification can be
   measured with the N? flux method after a pre-incubation time of about 10
   days. These checks included tests on contamination by atmospheric
   nitrogen, the incubation of irradiated sediments with and without
   addition of HgCl2 and addition of nitrate. The results of the two
   methods were different. In general the coupled
   nitrification-denitrification rates measured with the N-15 isotope
   pairing technique were lower than measured with the N-2 flux method.
   With the N-15 isotope pairing technique the denitrification rates of
   muddy sediments seemed to depend on the sampling date: spring sediments
   gave much higher denitrification rates than sediments collected in
   winter. In comparison with the denitrification calculated from a mass
   balance of the lake the N-15 method appears to underestimate the
   denitrification, whereas results of the N-2 flux method were in
   agreement with mass balance data. The following explanation for this
   difference was suggested. The N-15 isotope pairing technique is based on
   the idea that the different nitrate species ((NO3-)-N-14 and
   (NO3-)-N-15) are uniformly mixed and that the sediment is divided in
   aerobic and anaerobic layers. When however micro sites exist, probably
   uniform mixing of the nitrate species can not be assumed because of the
   very tight coupling between nitrification and denitrification in these
   sites. The coupled nitrification-denitrification will be underestimated.}},

Abstract = {{Methane release rates from the sediment in the lake were estimated by a

   cm depth of sediments. Overall methane release rate from sediments was
   19.9 mgCH(4)-m(-2)-h(-1). The maximum specific acetate and
   H-2-utilization rates, v(m), were 5.2 x 10(-5) to 7.96 x 10(-6) and 0.9
   x 10(-5) to 1.0 x 10(-4) gCOD-gVSS(-1)-h(-1) for the sediments collected
   in the depths of sediments, respectively. The half-velocity constant,
   K-s, were from 21 to 65.5 and 27 to 194 mgCOD-l(-1) for acetate- and
   H-2-utilizing methanogens in the depths of sediments, respectively. The
   acetate-utilizing methanogens were enumerated by the most probable

   anaerobic treatment reactors and marine sediments. The sediment of top
   20 cm had high microbial activity compared with the deeper section at

Abstract = {{Nine anaerobic chemostats fed glucose as the sole carbon and energy
   source were used to investigate the characteristics of soluble microbial
   products (SMP). These reactors were maintained at solids retention times
   (SRT) of 15, 25, and 40 days (3 reactors for each SRT) with organic
   loading rates of 0.25 or 0.50 g COD/1-d. Results showed that the
   concentration of SMP increased with increasing SRT (steady-state SMP for
   15-, 25-, and 40-d systems were 54, 126, and 291 mg GOD/1,
   respectively). Distribution of SMP among three molecular weight
   categories (MW<1000 daltons, 1000<MW<10,000, and MW>10,000) was bimodal.
   The fraction of SMP with MW>10,000 was found to increase with increasing
   SRT (34 mg/l and 48\% of total SMP for a 15-d SRT, 83 mg/l and 62\% for
   a 25-d SRT, and 242 mg/l and 76\% for a 40-d system). The stability
   constant (CK) between Ni and SMP was approximately 10(3.62), a value
   very similar to some naturally occurring organic acids. The total
   SMP-ligand concentration (C-T,C-L) ranged from 0.07 to 1.33 mM as Ni and
   increased with increasing SRT. The complexation capacity ranged from
   0.65 to 5.97 mu mol of Ni/mg SMP, and was independent of SRT with an
   average of 2.49 mu mol of Ni/mg SMP.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous-phase dissolved natural organic matter (DOM) and sediment
   organic matter (SOM) were shown in laboratory mini-column experiments to
   affect the transport of bacteria within porous media. Attachment
   efficiencies of bacteria were estimated from their retention on quartz,
   iron oxide coated quartz (Fe-quartz), and Fe-quartz coated with SOM
   (SOM-Fe-quartz). Suwannee River Humic Acid (SRHA) and Soil Humic Acid
   (SHA) were used to represent organic matter (SOM and DOM), and were
   added to radiolabeled bacterial suspensions (10(6) cells/ml, pH = 7.7)
   prior to transport. Coating quartz with iron oxide increased bacterial
   retention 160\% relative to uncoated quartz. Coating Fe-quartz with SOM
   lowered bacterial retention, resulting in a fraction retained only 33\%
   greater than retained on uncoated quartz. Compared to these effects, the
   effect of DOM on bacterial retention was secondary, and reflected the
   extent of DOM adsorption to the porous media. When DOM did not interact
   with the porous media, as in the case of quartz, bacterial retention in
   the presence of DOM was reduced by 20\%. However, when DOM adsorption to
   the porous media was increased by coating the quartz with iron oxide,
   bacterial retention on the Fe-quartz increased by 10\%. When Fe-quartz
   surfaces were loaded with DOM to equilibrium conditions to produce
   SOM-Fe-quartz, the presence of DOM in the applied solution also
   increased bacterial retention by 10\%. The effects of DOM were the same
   for both types of humic acids (SHA or SRHA). These results suggest that
   SOM and DOM affect bacterial transport by increasing the negative
   surface charge of the Pe-quartz and bacteria, respectively. The largest
   decrease in bacterial retention (60\%) was associated with coating of
   Fe-quartz by SOM in the absence of DOM.}},

Abstract = {{The release behavior of chromium from tannery sludge was assessed in
   this study. Fundamental properties of sludge were characterized. Total
   Cr content was 17,200 mg/kg. Trivalent chromium, Cr(III), was the
   predominant species in the sludge. The total Cr and Cr(VI)
   concentrations in the leachate of TCLP were 5.02 and 0.25 mg/dm(3),
   respectively. Solubility of Cr from sludge was the lowest in the neutral
   range. Both pH and redox potential significantly affected release of Cr
   from the sludge. When sludge suspension was continuously aerated with
   oxygen for 600 hours, pH increased from 7.1 to 7.3, and redox potential
   increased from -300 to 295 mV, respectively. Dissolved Cr concentrations
   were lower than 7 mg/kg during the aeration period. The equilibrium
   solubility experiments were first conducted when the pH value was
   maintained at 4.2, and varied redox potential (0, 150, 250, 320, 470
   mV), dissolved Cr concentrations decreased with increased redox
   potential. When the pH value was maintained at 8.0, and varied redox
   potential (-220, -100, 0, 150, 250 mV), dissolved Cr concentrations were
   relatively low. A linear correlation was observed between dissolved
   concentrations of Cr and Fe. Combining with results from sludge
   fractionation experiment, we can conclude that precipitation-dissolution
   reactions controlled the release behavior of Cr.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of developing empirical models with well determined
   parameters is to obtain a better understanding of the nitrification of
   activated sludge. The D-optimal experimental design criterion and
   nonlinear regression analysis were used to obtain precise parameter
   estimates. Our experiment consisted of a series of 14 batch runs where
   activated sludge was spiked with ammonium chloride and sodium nitrite
   individually and in combination. Specific respiration rate, the ratio of
   respiration rate to mixed liquor suspended solids concentration, was
   used as the model response variable. Empirical models for specific
   respiration rate were specified as piecewise, Monod type functions of
   ammonium and nitrite concentration. Statistical methods were used to
   evaluate the effects of nonlinearity and parameter correlation on the
   models. The effect of experimental design on model specification and on
   parameter estimation is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) catalyses the oxidation of phenols by
   hydrogen peroxide resulting in the formation of water-insoluble polymers
   which can be separated by coagulation and sedimentation:;The feasibility
   of the enzyme process to treat a foundry wastewater containing 3.5 mM of
   total phenols (330 mg/l as phenol) was examined. Two enzyme stocks of
   different purities were used but total phenols removal was independent
   of enzyme purity. For both stocks, 97 to 99\% of the phenolic
   contaminants were removed, despite the presence of other contaminants
   such as organic compounds and iron in the waste matrix. The quantity of
   HRP required for this degree of treatment was in the same range as for
   the treatment of a synthetic wastewater containing an equal amount of
   pure phenol. Polyethylene glycol, a chemical additive, reduced enzyme
   inactivation, allowing a 22-fold reduction in the amount of HRP required
   for 99\% removal of phenols from the foundry waste. Residual chemical
   oxygen demands (GOD) varied depending on the enzyme source. The high
   purity HRP achieved more than 65\% removal of GOD, bur due to a high
   concentration of other organic matter present in the low purity HRP, no
   reduction in COD was achieved with this enzyme source. A comparison was
   made between enzyme treatment and oxidation using Fenton's reagent.
   Enzyme cost must be significantly reduced in order to make the enzyme
   treatment process economically competitive.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial denitrification of drinking water was studied in laboratory
   columns packed with shredded newspapers. Newspaper served as the sole
   carbon and energy substrate as well as the only physical support for the

   readily achieved, without accumulation of nitrite. The treated water
   contained low dissolved organic carbon (4-10 mg 1(-1)). The
   cellulose-dependent denitrification process was sensitive to changes in
   temperature: nitrate removal rates at 14 degrees C were approximately
   one third of the rates observed at 32 degrees C. Pretreatment of
   newspaper with diluted NaOH or diluted HCL, or by autoclave did not
   improve the efficiency of the process. A time-dependent decay in
   denitrification rate was noticeable after several months of operation.
   The reasons for this phenomenon, which may be due to weakened adhesion
   of the bacteria to the substrate, are under investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The filtration of seawater is an important industrial operation,
   particularly in the offshore oil industry where large quantities of
   seawater are filtered prior to injection in to the oil bearing strata as
   a means of oil recovery. Cartridge filtration systems, particularly
   those involving spool wound elements are common in many areas of solid
   liquid separation. These include the chemical and pharmaceutical
   industries, domestic and industrial water processing, automotive and
   electroplating industries and also on offshore oil production platforms.
   However, the performance of these cartridges in actual service has been
   found to be less than ideal. The effect of organically loaded
   feedstreams on the performance of spool wound cartridge filters was
   determined using standard filter test methodology according to ISO 4572
   (1981). The system was adapted allowing filter testing with aqueous
   fluids and dosing of the test fluid with concentrations of proteinaceous
   materials and lipids. The effect of different concentrations of protein
   and lipid on filter performance was interpreted in terms of filter life,
   particle retention efficiency and dirt holding capacity. The degree of
   permeation of the organic material into the filtrate was also assessed
   by biochemical assays.}},

Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The highly non-linear response of the pH value to the addition of acid
   or base makes pH control by conventional means very difficult, in
   particular when the buffer capacity of the system is not known. The aim
   of this study was the development and implementation of a computer-based
   pH measurement and fuzzy logic pH controller using a simple, low cost,
   pH measurement unit. The pH controller was devised to have a wide range
   of possible application such as the control of pH value in a laboratory
   reactor, or the neutralisation of waste water streams of industrial
   processes. This means that the controller had to be self adaptive to
   different or changing system parameters. The pH controller is based on
   fuzzy logic because it permits the inclusion of subjective knowledge,
   often based on experience and not on a theoretical model. It can employ
   data that are, to a certain extent inconsistent and it may use primary
   knowledge (for example experimental results) directly. We built up a
   self-optimizing pH measurement and controlling system that is capable of
   controlling the pH value within +/- 0.1 units, and within a very short
   response time. The pH-fuzzy controller is applicable to any Fermentation
   process requiring in situ pH measurement and control. The self
   adaptability of the controller makes it independent of the buffer
   capacity of the system, so that it is even possible to adjust the pH
   value of distilled water by adding 1 N acid or base solution. The
   controller can also be used in any pH neutralization plant for chemical
   waste water by adding the required amount of acid or alkaline solution
   with high accuracy, thereby preventing any pH value overshoot.}},

   while HCl-P was correlated to Per (r(2) = 0.68), TP (r(2) = 0.28) and to
   phytoplankton biovolume (r(2) = 0.35), but not to Ca. On average 4\% of
   the surface sediment TP was NH4Cl-extractable, 35\% NaOH-extractable and
   20\% HCl-extractable, with the remaining 41\% being residual phosphorus
   (Res-P). At sediment depths below 50 cm the Res-P fraction was greater
   (63\% of TP), while there was still considerable NaOH-P (21\% of TP),
   thus indicating a significant permanent deposition of iron-bound
   phosphorus. In most sediments a higher surface Res-P and NaOH-P were
   recorded as compared to depths below 20-30 cm. The presence of a NaOH-P
   gradient, even in lakes in which P-lake and anthropogenic impact were
   low, suggests that post-depositional mobility of phosphorus may occur.
   The Res-P gradient indicates that a major part of the organically bound
   phosphorus in the upper 10-20 cm of the sediment eventually is
   mineralized and dissolved.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing importance of disinfection of drinking water by u.v.
   radiation makes it necessary to determine the u.v, dose which is applied
   to the water by u.v.-disinfection plants. In Austria a minimum
   microbicidal dose of 400 Jm(-2) at a wavelength of 253.7 nm is demanded
   for drinking water, the control of it shall be assured by type testing.
   A method was developed in using calibrated spores of Bacillus subtilis
   as biodosimeter which are added to the inflowing water, and after
   determination of their survival rate in the plant one can deduce the
   applied dose from it. This procedure is unproblematic as long as all
   microorganisms receive the same dose on their way through the reactor.
   But in some cases, and probably this is the normal case, not all
   microorganisms receive the same dose. It follows that a dose
   distribution will exist among the test organisms which have passed
   through the reactor. The dose (reduction-equivalent dose or RED) which
   is deduced from the survival rate of the microorganisms passing
   flow-through systems for u.v.-disinfection of wastewater or drinking
   water in general is different from the arithmetic mean of the dose
   distribution. The RED depends on the special form of the dose
   distribution and on the specific shape of the survival curve of the test
   organisms. The broader the dose distribution and the higher the
   u.v.-susceptibility of the microorganisms, the lower is the measured
   RED. But if the survival curve of the microorganisms used would have a
   shoulder (D-s > D-m), and the dose distribution would overlap with the
   shoulder the RED may increase. We investigated by calculations and by
   experiments the influences on the test results obtained by this method.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model with two kinetics variations was developed for the
   description of oxygen consumption in aerobic heterotrophic processes in
   longitudinal aqueous dual-phase systems where biomass is suspended in
   the liquid and attached on the solid material surface. This pertains to
   sewers, drains, rivers and certain wastewater treatment reactors. The
   model parameters were related to the liquid and solid phases, such as
   suspended biomass concentration X, its maximum growth rate mu(max) water
   volume V, biofilm oxygen up-take rate BUR, and the biofilm covered area
   WA. The Monod equation-based zero and first order kinetics were
   applicable depending on organics concentration. Simulation demonstrated
   the influence of relevant parameters on the oxygen profile. It
   illustrated that the suspended biomass can play a critically important
   role, which generally should not be neglected; the relative importance
   of the two biomass types is system dependent, and can be quantitatively
   assessed on the basis of the parameters mentioned above. The potential
   application of the model is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Survival and development of Ascaris suum eggs in sewage sludge mixed
   with 10\% w/w of quick lime (85\% CaO) has been examined. Fresh
   collected A. suum eggs were mixed in sewage sludge during lime
   treatment. The development of the eggs was followed every second week
   during a 10 weeks period and again after 5 months, parallel with control
   eggs. Lime treatment of sewage sludge resulted in a pH > 12 and
   development of A. suum eggs was strongly reduced during the observation
   period. When the Ascaris eggs were isolated from the lime treated sewage
   sludge and suspended at neutral pH, the proportion that developed to
   larvated eggs decreased with time. Thus, the inactivation of A. suum
   eggs was reversible following short time storage while prolonged storage
   of sludge with pH > 12 completely destructed the ability of A. suum eggs
   to embryonate. A. suum eggs uniformly mixed into the sludge lost the
   ability to embryonate at a faster rate than eggs deposited in nylon
   bags. After 5 months no intact eggs could be identified in the sludge.
   Incubation of A. suum eggs at neutral pH imitate spreading on
   agricultural land, where the eggs could be a potential infective hazard.
   In conclusion, lime treatment and storage of sewage sludge at pH > 12
   for at least 3 months can be recommended as a hygienic measure before
   application on agricultural land.}},

Abstract = {{In the past, the geometric mean, or less frequently the arithmetic mean,
   has been used as a summary descriptor of microorganism densities in
   waters and other environmental media. It is shown in this paper that, if
   the interest is characterizing the risk from organisms that are
   described by either an exponential dose-response relationship, or a
   dose-response relationship that is linear at low doses, the appropriate
   summary descriptor is the arithmetic mean. Therefore, in future work,
   authors should be encouraged to report data on such organisms using this
   summary descriptor.}},

Abstract = {{The identification, characterisation and formation of manganese minerals
   takanelite and kutnahorite calcian found in the Krka River Estuary, is
   described. These minerals originated from the hydrochemical
   transformation of waste disposed from a ferromanganese factory.
   Industrial slag, dust settled inside a chimney, and marine sediments in
   the vicinity of the ferromanganese plant `'Crnica'', situated in the
   suburb of the city of Sibenik were analysed in details. The samples of
   slag and dust were equilibrated with estuarine waters for 20 d. In
   marine sediment, calcite is predominant, while quartz, aragonite,
   kutnahorite calcian and dolomite were found as minor components. Iron is
   present in all samples as an amorphous phase. Strontium, titanium,
   copper, zinc, lead and rubidium were found as microcomponents. It was
   found that slag and dust particles partly dissolve in contact with
   estuarine water of different salinities, and present renewable supply of
   manganese, iron and numerous trace elements. A possible way of the
   formation of manganese minerals takanelite and kutnahorite is discussed.
   Takanelite mineral was obtained in laboratory by partial disolution of
   slag containing bustamite ferroan. For kutnahorite calcian it is
   suggested that it forms in the process of dolomitization; With respect
   to aqueous environment of the Krka River Estuary, the slag and dust from
   a ferromanganese industry upon contact with water transform into
   scavengers (gypsum, calcite, quartz, takanelite) which help purifying
   the water column from other micro-impurities.}},

Abstract = {{Epiphytic microorganisms were investigated in two watercourses which
   were enriched by sewage-works effluent. These were a disused canal and a
   small stream in North-East England. Scanning electron microscopy, on the
   submerged macrophytes Callitriche sp. and Eloden canadensis, from the
   canal, demonstrated abundant epiphyton which was dominated by rod-shaped
   bacteria and pennate diatoms, especially Cocconeis sp. An in situ
   counting technique showed that the density of epiphytic bacteria was
   greater downstream of the sewage-works outfall on plants from both
   watercourses. The proportion of metabolically-active epiphytic bacteria,
   and cell length of epiphytic bacteria, were determined on Callitriche in
   the small stream, and were greater downstream of the outfall. Thus
   increase in (1) the population density of epiphytic bacteria, (2) the
   proportion of cells which were metabolically active, and (3) cell size,
   combined to increase the potential contribution of epiphytic bacteria to
   biopurification and downstream recovery. Epiphytic diatoms, in contrast
   to bacteria, apparently did not increase in abundance downstream of the
   outfalls.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was identification of optimal surfactant
   systems for remediating chromate-contaminated subsurface environments.
   Batch and column studies were conducted utilizing chromium contaminated
   soil obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard Support Center, Elizabeth City,
   N.C. Results of the batch studies demonstrated that surfactants, when
   used alone, were able to enhance the extraction of chromate 2.0-2.5
   times greater than water. When a complexing agent, diphenyl carbazide,
   was solubilized by aqueous micelles the system was able to enhance the
   chromate elution by 9.3 to 12.0 times greater than water (or 3.7-5.7
   times greater than surfactant without the complexing agent). Column
   studies showed that when surfactants are used along with the complexing
   agent, 213\% of Cr(VI) can be removed relative to D.I. water in less
   than 20 pore volumes, whereas D.I. water took 35 pore volumes to reach
   the baseline removal. The economics of surfactant enhanced subsurface
   remediation will be affected by surfactant losses (e.g. precipitation
   and sorption); batch and column studies were conducted to evaluate the
   losses of surfactants due to such phenomena. Results of these laboratory
   studies demonstrated that the surfactant system containing Dowfax 8390
   and diphenyl carbazide was most effective in remediation of the chromium
   contaminated soil.}},

Abstract = {{The simple mathematical model described in v. Schulthess et al., 1994
   {[}Wat. Sci. Technol. 30(6), 123-132] could only be used for the
   identification of the most important mechanism leading to nitrous oxide
   (N2O) accumulation in denitrifying activated sludge systems. In this
   report the mentioned model is extended with the consumption of organic
   substrate and with nitrification to predict the nitrous oxide
   accumulation in continuously fed full scale waste water treatment
   plants. In full scale waste water treatment plants the nitrous oxide
   emission cannot be measured directly. Therefore, a gas stripper for
   measuring the dissolved nitrous oxide in the anoxic and aerobic reactor
   was built. Four experiments with different operating conditions were
   performed to verify the model. In these experiments oxygen concentration
   as well as the nitrogen and organic substrate load were varied. As it
   was possible to properly describe the experiments with the extended
   mathematical model it could be used to calculate the N2O emission of a
   nitrifying/denitrifying activated sludge system. Even under undesirable
   operating conditions (low oxygen concentration in the first reactor) the
   nitrous oxide emission is very low as compared to the total nitrogen in
   the inlet of the plant (< 0.1\%).}},

Abstract = {{A substantial nitrification in rapid infiltration (RI) systems for
   wastewater treatment is a prerequisite for obtaining good N removal by
   denitrification. The purpose of this study is to investigate
   nitrification in porous media at conditions corresponding to RI
   treatment systems. Nitrification in six 50-cm porous media columns (98\%
   weathered granite or sand and 2\% field soil) during unsaturated
   leaching at constant flow rates of synthetic wastewater was
   investigated. Concentrations of NH4-N between 20 and 60 mg 1(-1) were
   applied and vertical concentration profiles of NO3-N, NO2-N and NH2-N
   were measured for 54 d at 30 degrees C (three columns) and for 140 d at
   10 degrees C (three columns). A time lag in nitrification of 20 d was
   found at 10 degrees C. Complete nitrification was obtained after 3-5 d
   at 30 degrees C and after approximately 50 d at 10 degrees C. Assuming
   first-order nitrification at steady-state, the corresponding first order
   reaction rate coefficients (k(1)) for NO3 production in the columns were
   estimated to be between 0.4 and 1 h(-1) at 10 degrees C and between 6
   and 9 h(-1) at 30 degrees C. Steady-stale NO3 profiles were obtained
   between 1.5 and up to 9 weeks after the experiments were started. At the
   actual soil-air contents (0.10 cm(3) air phase cm(-3) soil), oxygen
   limitations were not observed during the experiments. Nitrogen loadings
   (water flow times N concentration) above 100 mg N 1(-1) cm h(-1) (1 g N
   m(-2) h(-1)) caused NH4 accumulation in the columns at 10 degrees C and
   should probably be avoided during operation of RI system.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of using free-settling test for estimating activated
   sludge floc density was discussed in the present work. Some usually
   applied models or correlations, such as for the primary particle
   density, the drag coefficient, the correction factor for advection flow
   through the flee and the estimation for flee permeability, are examined.
   The results show that flee permeability depends strongly on the models
   br parameter sets applied. However, the effective flee density, and also
   the fractal dimension, is insensitive to the flee permeability
   estimation, but is strongly dependent on the drag coefficient expression
   employed. Possible valid experimental range is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Pools of Fe(II) and Fe(tot) in activated sludge from a nutrient removal
   plant were determined after extraction with HCl, oxalate or Ferrozine.
   Of a total Fe content in fresh sludge of 1.12 mmol per g dry sludge
   (62.6 mg/g TS), HCl and oxalate extracted 80.7 and 90.5\%, respectively.
   More than 70\% was as Fe(III). Fe(III) reduction was immediately
   initiated when sludge was stored anaerobically. The levels of Fe(II)
   observed during the anaerobic storage period depended on the method
   used. With HCl and oxalate extraction techniques Fe(II) continuously
   increased during two days of storage, whereas Ferrozine extractable
   Fe(II) accumulated more slowly over the first 24 h of anaerobic storage
   and did not increase beyond that time. Almost all produced Fe(II)
   remained associated to the hoc matrix, so soluble Fe2+ was very low. In
   short-term (10 h) and long-term (2 days) anaerobic incubations Fe(II)
   accumulation rates were in the range 6.0-29.4 mu mol per g organic
   matter per hour at 20 degrees C, where the highest rates were obtained
   in short-term experiments. Fe(III) reduction was of minor significance
   as electron acceptor for turnover of organic substrate compared to
   oxygen or nitrate, but could be of importance compared to other
   anaerobic processes. The reduction was of significance for possible
   release of phosphate into bulk water in an anaerobic bio-P tank and by
   anaerobic storage of sludge before dewatering.}},

Abstract = {{The loading of organic substrates into shallow aquifers may follow
   seasonal cycles, which will impact the transport and fate of
   agrichemicals. The objective of this research was to measure temporal
   changes in the groundwater dissolved organic C (DOC) and nitrate
   concentrations. Groundwater monitoring wells were installed and sediment
   samples from the aquifer were collected in 1991. Sediment samples were
   used to evaluate denitrification potentials, while water samples were
   collected at periodic intervals in 1992 and 1993 from the surface of the
   aquifer. Water samples were analyzed for nitrate-N and DOC-C.
   Denitrification was observed in sediment amended with nitrate and
   incubated under anaerobic conditions at 10 degrees C. Addition of algae
   lazed biomass increased denitrification, establishing that
   denitrification was substrate limited. In the aquifer, DOC
   concentrations followed seasonal patterns. DOC concentrations were
   highest following spring recharge and then decreased. Peak timing
   indicates that freezing and thawing were responsible for seasonal DOC
   patterns. These findings show that seasonally driven physical processes,
   such as freezing and thawing, influence organic substrate transport from
   surface to subsurface environments, and that this process should be
   taken into account when assessing agrichemical detoxification rates in
   shallow aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{Genotoxicity was evaluated in the performance of nightsoil treatment
   plants, because the human feces and urine would contain some genotoxic

   activities induced by nitroarenes and aromatic amines. Strong
   genotoxicity could be observed in the influent of a nightsoil treatment
   plant and the effluent from biological reactor by both of parent strain
   and new strains. The quantitative analysis using the genotoxic
   intensity, that is, the slopes of dose-response was conducted to compare
   the genotoxicity on a group of some compounds included in complex
   samples such as nightsoil. The genotoxicity on aromatic amines was
   converted to the potency by aminofluorene represented as mg
   aminofluorene/mg dry weight. The genotoxicity could not be removed by
   biological treatment process and ultra filtration, and reduced around
   90\% by coagulation-sedimentation process. While the potency on
   nitroarenes which was converted to 1-nitropyrene, mg nitropyrene/mg dry
   weight, could not be removed sufficiently through the treatment process.}},

Abstract = {{The biotransformabilities of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA) and carbon
   tetrachloride (CT) were investigated at 35 degrees C under low
   concentration of acetic acid as the auxiliary substrate to evaluate the
   concentration effect of the auxiliary substrate on the biotransformation
   of the chlorinated hydrocarbons. Data shown in this study demonstrated
   that concentration of acetic acid could change the dechlorination
   capability of the microorganisms and, thus, influence the
   biotransformation of chlorinated hydrocarbons. The rate of the
   biotransformation of CT and TCA in the concentration range of 100-1000
   mu g/l increased progressively with the increase of the substrate
   concentration ranged from 0 to 30 mg/l. Nearly complete
   biotransformation of CT was obtained in 32 days. TCA was degraded slower
   than CT and removal of 20-91\% was observed in 85 days, depending on the
   concentrations of both the primary substrate and the chlorinated
   compound. These removal efficiencies corresponded to second-order rate
   coefficients of 0.0006-0.0041 1/mg-VSS/d and 2.75 x 10(-5) to 2.97 x
   10(-4) 1/mg-VSS/d for CT and TCA, respectively. Available substrate
   supply is essential for the dechlorination of chlorinated compounds
   which is demonstrated by the experimental results showing the effects of
   the substrate concentration and the compound concentration. Also, the
   difference between the oxidation-reduction potentials of these two
   chlorinated hydrocarbons gives a possible explanation for the difference
   of the biotransformabilities of CT and TCA under some substrate
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A nitrification study was conducted in continuous flow stirred tank
   reactors using high strength nitrogenous wastewater (concentrated stream
   from a urea plant mixed with pharmaceutical wastewater). The reactors
   were operated at different solids retention times (SRT = 10-62.5 d) and
   hydraulic retention times (HRT = 1.5-2.1 d). Pharmaceutical wastewater
   was used as an organic carbon source to maintain a COD/TKN ratio of 1.
   The nitrification achieved at different SRTs varied from 87 to 99\%. The
   nitrogen balance data show that ammonia assimilation and denitrification
   accounted for 4-53\% of the total nitrogen removed. The yield
   coefficients and decay coefficients were Y-b = 0.5 (COD basis), k(db) =
   0.07 d(-1) (COD basis) for heterotrophs and Y-n = 0.15 (TKN basis),
   k(dn) = 0.06 d(-1) (TKN basis) for nitrifiers respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of toxic organic chemicals on the kinetics of hydrogen
   conversion in ethanol-enriched cultures has been investigated. The study
   first involved an assessment of the kinetics of gaseous hydrogen
   transformation in a hydrogen-enriched culture. Tests to quantify the
   distribution of biomass in an ethanol-enriched culture indicated that
   hydrogenotropic methanogens made up 25.4\% of the total biomass. Various
   amounts of chlorinated anilines were then added to ethanol-enriched test
   cultures to determine their impact on the hydrogen conversion reaction.
   Test results indicated that hydrogen conversion was mass-transfer
   limited from the gas phase but not from solution. While chlorinated
   anilines had a major adverse impact on acetogenic conversion of ethanol
   to hydrogen, the associated hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis reaction was
   affected to lesser extent by the toxicants. Tests with 3-chlorophenol
   showed similar inhibition of acetogenesis and acetoclastic
   methanogenesis but not hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. The principal
   significance in this study is thought to lie in the use of specific
   hydrogenotrophic biomass for assessing the kinetics of hydrogen
   conversion and in the observation that the kinetics of hydrogenotrophic
   methanogenesis was not adversely affected by chlorinated anilines and
   chlorinated phenols. The principal application lies in the observation
   that gas-phase hydrogen may not be a good measure of the impact of toxic
   organic chemicals on anaerobic digestion processes.}},

Abstract = {{The development of bacterial communities in drinking water supply
   networks may give rise to bacterial concentrations exceeding drinking
   water standards and also lead to the establishment of a food chain which
   allows the growth of macroorganisms incompatible with water quality
   requirements. Under such circumstances, drinking water reservoirs with
   relatively long residence times undoubtedly represent a very weak link
   in efforts to maintain water quality within a distribution network.
   Nevertheless, very few studies have examined the microbial communities
   and their trophic relationships in drinking water reservoirs. The goal
   of this study was to identify and quantify the microbial communities
   growing in a drinking water reservoir, and to follow their seasonal
   dynamics.
   Following cleaning and filling of the reservoir, 15 series of samples
   were collected between November 1991 and July 1992. Microorganisms of
   the inflowing water as well as those growing in the reservoir were
   analyzed. Bacteria were fixed in formaldehyde, stained with 4.6 diamino
   2 phenylidole (DAPI) and counted by epifluorescence microscopy (Porter
   and Feig, 1980). Autotrophic and heterotrophic flagellated protozoa were
   fixed with glutaraldehyde, stained with primuline and counted by
   epifluorescence microscopy. Ciliates and amoebae were fixed with
   mercuric chloride (HgCl2), microalgae with Lugol's solution, and all
   three types of organisms were counted with an inverted microscope.
   Rotifers and crustacea were fixed with formaldehyde and also counted
   with an inverted microscope. Chlorophyll a was extracted with 90\%
   acetone and analyzed by HPLC according to Mantoura and Llewelyn (1983).
   The biomass of autotrophic microorganisms (essentially microalgae
   belonging to the class of Diatomophyceae) was very low and consisted of
   senescent cells in both, the inflowing water and the reservoir.
   Heterotrophic microbes were dominated by bacteria. The latter made up
   84.5 and 91\% of the total biomass of microbial heterotrophs in the
   reservoir and inflowing water, respectively (Fig. 9).}},

Abstract = {{In experimental ditches gross and net production were estimated from
   continuous dissolved oxygen measurements for individual days over a two
   year period. There are two series of three ditches: the first is
   dominated by benthic algae, and the second by submerged macrophytes.
   Each series receives three different levels of external nutrient (N,P)
   loading, referred to as reference, medium-loaded and highest-loaded
   level. Generally, there were no vertical oxygen gradients, and a one-box
   model satisfied. For periods with O-2-stratification a two-box model has
   been developed. This model assumes that primary production only occurs
   in a well mixed top layer. In both series, the cumulative gross primary
   production over two years was positively related to the level of
   external nutrient input. In the ditches dominated by benthic algae, a
   continuous increase in cumulative net systems production, that was
   positively related to the level of external nutrient input, was
   observed. In the macrophyte ditches, the cumulative net systems
   production was positively related to the level of nutrient input during
   the first half year, but after that showed an irregular pattern. The
   maximum, areal daily gross productions during the summer, corrected for
   temperature, increased from 1990 to 1991 in all ditches dominated by
   benthic algae, but decreased in all macrophyte ditches. The accumulation
   of biomass in the ditches with benthic algae was calculated from the
   cumulative net production, and showed a good agreement with measured
   values in the reference ditch, but yielded higher values than measured
   in the medium-loaded and highest-loaded ditches. Reaeration was
   calculated using a system specific, empirical wind-reaeration
   relationship. The wind speed was on average higher during the afternoon
   than during the rest of the day. High wind speeds thus coincide with
   high oxygen saturations, and the use of a variable reaeration
   coefficient during a day results in higher gross and net production
   estimates than the use of a constant value throughout a day.}},

Abstract = {{Large amounts of de-icing agents consisting mainly of diethylene glycol
   and propylene glycol are used at many airports during the winter time.
   At modern airports a large proportion of the mixture of de-icing agents
   and meltwater is recycled and reused. Meltwater containing smaller
   amounts of de-icing agents is usually collected in retention basins and
   discharged into municipal sewage treatment plants. Extensive
   investigations have proved that waste water containing diethylene glycol
   may cause severe disturbances in sewage treatment. Only by avoiding
   shock loads and by maintaining an adapted activated sludge at the sewage
   treatment plant especially at a low waste water temperature can ensure
   that COD and BOD effluent values do not exceed critical limits.}},

Abstract = {{In order to predict the dissolution of multi component mixtures in the
   subsurface, a mathematical model is developed. The model contains
   essential processes such as dissolution, dilution, mass transfer and
   multi component interactions. Experimental data obtained in present work
   is simulated by using this model. Experimental studies performed with
   the mixture of Trichloroethylene (TCE) and Perchloroethylene (PCE) in
   five columns shows that added whole mixture does not participate to
   dissolution process. Some amount of the mixture subsides to the
   underside of the column and a pool of the mixture is formed. The pool
   formation causes lower dissolution rates because of lower contact
   opportunity with water. Residual saturation values relatively to the
   void volume are obtained as 5.08\% for TCE and 2.43\% for PCE,
   volumetrically. In the simulation of experimental data, these poolings
   are taken into account by the subtraction of the pooled amount from
   total mixture amount, when there is not enough hydraulic hardening to
   get contact with whole mixture due to insufficient present residual
   content.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of using the insect growth regulator pyriproxyfen to
   control the nuisance fly Psychoda alternata on the biological filters at
   Failsworth Sewage Works, Greater Manchester, was investigated. In the
   trials, populations of P. alternata in a test filter dosed with
   insecticide were compared with an untreated control filter. Two trials
   were undertaken which tested the efficacy of different formulations of
   the insecticide. In the first trial (August 1991) pyriproxyfen was
   applied as an aqueous suspension of active ingredient at a concentration
   of 0.5 mg l(-1). Significant (P < 0.05) reductions in the number of P.
   alternata adults emerging from the test filter were achieved for a
   period of 22 d post treatment. Over this period reductions in emergence
   ranged from 19 to 77\%. In the second trial (September 1991)
   pyriproxyfen was applied as the granular formulation, Sumilarv(R), to
   the surface of the filter, at a dose rate of 77.4 g m(-2) of filter
   area, equivalent to an estimated concentration of 0.42 mg l(-1) in the
   filter over a 2h period. This produced significant (P < 0.05) reductions
   in adult emergence for a period of 28 d. Control ranged from 35 to 92\%.
   No adverse effects on the non dipteran filter fauna, the chemical
   performance of the filter, or on the invertebrates in the river
   receiving the works effluent, were detected for the two trials.}},

Abstract = {{The fate and effects of resin acids in anaerobic and aerobic biological

   With a non-acclimated anaerobic biomass inoculum, no degradation of
   resin acids was observed under anaerobic conditions after exposure times
   of up to 24 d. Inhibition of methanogenic activity of the anaerobic
   consortium was noted at initial resin acid/biomass ratios exceeding
   0.0031 mg resin acids/mg VSS. Inhibited methanogenic populations were
   capable of acclimation to high concentrations of resin acids after 7-13
   d of exposure. Under aerobic batch conditions with a non-acclimated
   activated sludge inoculum, high initial resin acid concentrations were
   reduced to detection limits in 2-3 d. The highest specific removal rate
   of 109 mg resin acids/g VSS d measured in this study with non-acclimated
   aerobic biomass, was much higher than comparable values reported by
   others for acclimated aerobic biomass. The time required for removal
   appeared to be independent of the batch reactor biomass concentration.
   No evidence was found to suggest that high concentrations of resin acids
   resulted in inhibition under aerobic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Solutions of five resin acids were contacted with suspensions of
   non-acclimated, inactivated anaerobic and aerobic biomass to assess the
   contribution of partitioning on biosolids to the overall removal of
   resin acids in batch assays. Both types of biomass exhibited resin acid
   partitioning rates that were significantly greater than the rate of
   removal by degradation. With non-acclimated anaerobic biomass,
   partitioning was found to be the sole mechanism of resin acid removal.
   Partitioning on anaerobic biomass could not be described as a reversible
   adsorption process. Instead, it was found that a constant fraction of
   each resin acid partitioned into the biomass phase. With non-acclimated
   inactivated aerobic biomass, the partitioning of resin acids could be
   adequately described by a linear partitioning model. Dehydroabietic acid
   was the resin acid least strongly associated with biomass in both the
   anaerobic and aerobic experiments.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Currently, pollution by heavy metals is one of our most serious
   environmental problems. Metals such as lead and cadmium enter the
   biosphere through biogenic and anthropogenic emissions and have been
   steadily accumulating in soils and sediments. We report on a remote
   mountain lake in the Swiss Alps where the unusual conditions present
   have led to the accumulation of several heavy metals in the sediments.
   The sulfide rich environment contains precipitates of cadmium, lead and
   zinc. The anoxic conditions and prevalence of sulfate reducing bacteria
   in the water column have prevented the remobilisation of the metals
   leaving them trapped in the sediments. This has resulted in the
   formation of surprisingly `'stable'' metal profiles which have been
   correlated to levels of human and industrial activity and provide the
   means of reconstructing a record of human impact and pollution over the
   past 50 to 100 years. We suggest that such metals in sediment profiles
   can also be used as chronological markers in cases where cost or
   sampling difficulties Preclude the use of radiological Cs-137 and Pb-210
   dating. Stable metal profiles are valuable sources of environmental
   data, they reveal pertinent information on the atmospheric transport of
   contaminants and are relatively simple to analyse.}},

Abstract = {{The toxic effects of 2,4-D on Phaedoactylum tricornutum (Bohlin) and
   Dunaliella tertiolecta (Butcher), two species of phytoplankton well
   suited to bioassay studies and responsive to pollutants, were studied by
   monitoring changes in growth in terms of cell populations, chlorophyll
   fluorescence and the rate of (CO2)-C-14 assimilation. Short term
   bioassays, batch and continuous cultures were studied. Pure 2,4-D acid
   appeared more toxic than the commercial amine form of the herbicide but
   this may have been due to small quantities of acetone present in the
   solvent. Concentrations of amine herbicide in excess of 100 mg l(-1)
   extended the duration of the lag phase and inhibited growth but smaller
   concentrations stimulated growth, the amine being consumed by
   phytoplankton in preference to nitrate. Continuous culture confirmed the
   ability of phytoplankton to adapt slowly to herbicide concentrations
   even as high as 500 mg l(-1). It is suggested that green algae adapt
   more rapidly to environmental change than do diatoms.}},

Abstract = {{The filtration and expression behaviour of sewage sludge is discussed.
   Due to the increase of costs for controlled dumping and transport and
   more severe environmental legislation the need for decreased sludge
   volumes is rising. Filtration and expression are the cheapest dewatering
   operations and it is therefore desirable to remove the maximal feasible
   amount of water by mechanical dewatering. High dry solids contents of
   35-40 wt\% can already be reached at pressures of 300-400 kPa and
   optimal flocculation conditions; however at pressures of 6-10 MPa dry
   solids contents of 60 wt\% can be reached. Further the modelling of the
   dewatering is discussed; model and experiment show acceptable agreement.}},

Abstract = {{The release of the hydrophobic organic compounds pyrene, dibenzofuran

   laboratory microcosms. Initial Tubificid oligochaete densities of 0,
   6700 and 2.67 x 10(4) individuals . m(-2) were employed. Under oxygen
   saturated conditions, the difference between the contaminant fluxes from
   the high-density bioturbated microcosms and controls remained
   essentially constant at 37 and 70 ng . cm(-2). d(-1) for pyrene and
   phenanthrene, respectively, corresponding to effective mass transfer
   coefficients of 0.16 and 0.37 cm/y. Under hypoxic conditions, worm
   defecation on the sediment surface increased and led to significantly
   increased fluxes to a maximum of 380, 490 and 940 ng . cm(-2). d(-1),
   for pyrene, phenanthrene and dibenzofuran, respectively. Average
   bioturbation fluxes in the high-density microcosms of 246, 258 and 310

   effective mass transfer coefficients of 1.7, 3.2, and 7.5 cm/yr. Initial
   release rates from medium-density microcosms (25\% of high density) were
   typically half the release rate of the high-density microcosms,
   indicating greater organism activity per individual at the lower
   density. The increased flux with the more soluble compounds likely
   reflects more rapid release at the sediment surface and the increased
   importance of porewater pumping over sediment particle reworking for
   migration of these compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical nitrite and ammonia removal from aqueous solution was

   including the current input, pH, conductivity, buffer solution and

   their respective effect on the efficiency of nitrite and ammonia
   removal. The experimental results indicated that the time for complete
   nitrite removal and power consumption decrease with an increase in
   conductivity. For nitrite removal, the electrochemical process was found
   to consume less power when utilizing a current input larger than 2 A.
   The pH effect on the nitrite removal was observed to be significantly
   smaller than those of conductivity and current input. While the acidic
   environment favored the nitrite removal, the alkaline environment
   appeared to be beneficial to the ammonia removal. The ammonia removal
   was found to be a much slower process than the nitrite removal.}},

Abstract = {{A previous method based upon Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with
   fluorometric detection for determining linear aklylbenzenesulfonates
   (LAS) in aqueous environmental samples has been modified for extending
   it to the monitoring of dialkyltetralinsulfonates (DATS). DATS are
   reaction byproducts of LAS surfactant synthesis. 10, 100, 200, 1000 ml
   of respectively untreated sewage, treated one, riverwater and
   groundwater samples have been extracted by a 0.5-g Graphitized Carbon
   Black (GCB) cartridge. After sample extraction, co-extracted basic,
   neutral and weakly acidic compounds have been washed out by a formic
   acid containing solvent system. DATS and LAS have been then reextracted
   by passing through the cartridge a basified organic eluant mixture.
   After solvent removal and residue reconstitution by a suitable solvent
   system, the subfractionation of the analytes have been achieved by
   chromatographing them on a C-8 reverse-phase HPLC column. Recovery
   studies have shown that DATS have been quantitatively extracted by the
   GCB cartridge. By this procedure, the concentrations in water of DATS
   entering and leaving two sewage treatment plants in Rome have been
   monthly monitored over 1 year. With respect to LAS, the higher
   resistance to biodegradation of DATS has been demonstrated by
   comparative biodegradation tests. Analysis of a sewage-contaminated
   groundwater sample has shown that, although DAIS are minor components in
   LAS formulations, the concentration of the former was even higher than
   that of the latter, with C-10 DATS being the most abundant species.}},

Abstract = {{The toxicity of trivalent chromium to an anaerobic digestion system was
   studied using completely mixed anaerobic digesters. One of the digesters
   was operated as a control, one was dosed in a stepwise manner with
   increasing concentrations of chromium, allowing acclimatisation of the
   bacterial population and the other two digesters were used for shock
   injections of chromium but with no acclimatisation. The results have
   shown that a total concentration of 1140 mgl(-1) trivalent chromium was
   toxic to anaerobic digestion process when injected in stepwise manner.
   On the other hand, a toxic effect of the metal was observed at 500
   mgl(-1) concentration when shock injection was applied, resulting in the
   process failure. However, a shock injection of 400 mgl(-1) of trivalent
   chromium only caused a short term inhibition of the process with
   recovery taking place within a week.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption of ammonium (NH4+) to the sludge flee matrix has been
   investigated in two activated sludge treatment plants. When activated
   sludge was extracted in 1 N KCI the extractable amounts were between 0.5
   and 1.3 mg NH4+-N/l higher than the dissolved ammonium concentration at
   dissolved ammonium concentrations between 1 and 6 mg NH4+-N/l. The
   difference between the extractable and the dissolved ammonium, the
   exchangeable ammonium, thus represented 18-30\% of the dissolved
   ammonium concentration. A part of this, around 0.5-0.6 mg NH4+-N/l was
   not exchangeable under the actual operational conditions in the
   treatment plants due to a slow desorption kinetics, but seemed to be
   accessible for nitrification under prolonged aeration. The highest
   observed amount of adsorbed ammonium corresponded to 0.4-0.5 mg
   NH4+-N/gSS. Adsorption of ammonium should be investigated in more
   details and included in models for nitrogen mass balances for activated
   sludge.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Process industry remains sceptical of antiscale magnetic treatment (AMT)
   despite its long history. Manufacturer's claims concerning AMT comprise:
   (a) a reduction in the amount of scale formed, (b) production of a less
   tenacious scale due to a change in its crystal morphology, (c) removal
   of existing scale, and (d) a retention of the antiscaling properties of
   the treated water for hours following treatment. Scientific research has
   both substantiated and refuted these claims, creating widespread
   controversy as to the credibility of this type of water conditioning.
   Positive results indicate effects on: (a) colloidal systems where
   aggregation is generally enhanced and (b) crystallisation where larger
   hydrophilic crystals, usually with modified crystal growth, are
   generated. Investigations have incorporated scaling kinetics, scale
   morphology, scale solubility, particle coagulation and corrosion.
   Effects have been reported for different scale-forming compounds and for
   various microscopic and macroscopic parameters in single-phase systems.
   AMT appears to be enhanced by prolonged or repeated magnetic exposure,
   and is more effective above a threshold magnetic field contact time and
   in flowing systems. Effects have been reported in treated waters up to
   130 h after exposure has ceased. Industrial case studies indicate that
   the most successful implementations are in hot recirculating systems.
   Mechanisms presented to account for the observed effects comprise (a)
   intramolecular/intraionic interaction, (b) Lorentz force effects, (c)
   dissolution of contaminants, and (d) interfacial effects. The most
   plausible of these is the latter, in which the interaction of the
   magnetic field with the charged species present (ion clusters and
   crystallites) affects crystal nucleation and subsequent growth. The
   reported scale inhibition (and descaling) then occurs as a result of
   magnetically-produced hydrophilic discrete scale particles of
   substantially different size and crystal morphology to untreated
   systems, in which more adherent crystals are generated.}},

Abstract = {{Severe drought in the Thames catchment during 1989 and 1990 resulted in
   increased water abstraction from the river Thames, reducing the amount
   of freshwater flawing into the Thames estuary over Teddington weir.
   Increased salinity levels were recorded in the upper estuary, related to
   the decrease in flow, which in turn affected the community of freshwater
   invertebrates inhabiting a site below Teddington weir. A large decrease
   in BMWP score was recorded following increased abstraction in both 1989
   and 1990. However, the disappearance of taxa was not directly related to
   their perceived sensitivity to organic pollution, with Asellidae,
   Caenidae and Unionidae being amongst the first families to be affected.
   Multidimensional scaling ordination indicated that the community
   demonstrated acyclical pattern of disturbance and recovery related to
   variations in salinity and flow-dependent influx of organisms via
   invertebrate drift. The study indicates that reducing freshwater flow
   below a critical level can have detrimental effects on the diversity of
   macroinvertebrate communities in certain sections of tidal rivers.}},

Abstract = {{Two bench-scale sequencing batch reactors were fed with domestic
   wastewater and operated in an anaerobic-aerobic sequence For 139 d.
   Denitrification during the aerated react period was observed and the
   factors influencing the extent of simultaneous nitrification and
   denitrification were examined. It was found that the influence of DO on
   the nitrification rate during the aerated react period could be
   described by a Monod kinetic with a high oxygen half-saturation
   coefficient for autotrophic nitrifiers (K-O.A) of 4.5 mg/l. The
   dependency of the denitrification rate on DO could be described by a
   mathematical switching function with a higher switching function
   constant than expected, meaning that the extent of aerobic
   denitrification was higher than usual. It was also observed that aerobic
   denitrification decreased with time over the aerated react period. For
   most of the time of reactor operation nitrite was the main NOx species
   in the effluent, instead of the commonly expected nitrate. This led to
   the conclusion that the activity of Nitrobacter species was probably
   inhibited in the SBRs studied. It also demonstrated the Importance of
   measuring nitrite in the effluent to ensure that the reactor performance
   and the extent of aerobic denitrification was not over-estimated.}},

   pulses on aquatic organisms ranging from macroinvertebrates to small
   fish has been constructed and is described. A computer-controlled
   toxicant input system has been developed that is capable of generating
   and delivering toxicant pulses of varying shape, magnitude, amplitude
   and duration. Comparisons of predicted and actual toxicant
   concentrations have been carried out and hydraulic and toxicant
   conditions were found to be reproducible. Sample results are given of
   the effect of short-term pulses of cadmium on the amphipod Gammarus
   pulex. Possible future developments of the system are discussed.}},

   evaluate the attrition experienced by various media during backwashing
   by performing accelerated backwash tests in a pilot column, using a
   combined water and air backwash at combinations that gave the condition
   known as collapse-pulsing. Since the dominant mode of attrition was
   assumed to be abrasion, the effluent was sampled at a number of
   intervals to determine the amount of fine material in the effluent. Coal
   based GAC exhibited the highest weight loss (similar to 7\%) and sand
   the least (similar to 2\%).}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{30}},

Pages = {{295-298}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The objective of the present work was the enhancement of the efficiency
   of microbiological processes in purification of high-salinity oil-field
   brine by adding the powdered activated carbon (PAC) to the bioreactor
   and by diluting the brine with surface water. The investigation was
   carried out in a laboratory setup. Results show that the nature of
   pollutants and the high salinity (about 29 g/l) of oil-field brine had
   an unfavourable effect on the activated sludge process. Higher hydraulic
   loads (above 2.5 d(-1)) increased wash-out of the activated sludge from
   the bioreactor, so that an increased concentration of the suspended
   matter in the settler was observed. The addition of PAC to the
   bioreactor, combined with the dilution of oil-field brine with surface
   water, produced a substantial improvement in the sludge volume index.
   Also, under the given conditions, it was possible to maintain the given
   concentration of the activated carbon in the bioreactor. The procedure
   involving PAC and dilution with surface water resulted in an increased
   rate of pollutant degradation. The positive effect of PAC on the process
   of oil-field brine purification with the activated sludge was explained
   by the possibility of immobilization of microorganisms on the activated
   carbon surface in the form of a biofilm.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the initial concentration of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) on
   its biotransformation and on the microbial utilization of ethanol was
   investigated. The culture used in this study was acclimated in a
   continuous flow laboratory fermenter with 2,4-DNT and ethanol as
   substrates under strict anaerobic conditions at 35 degrees C.
   Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP) tests were conducted in an anaerobic
   respirometer, and the acclimated culture from the fermenter served as
   the inoculum. 2,4-DNT was completely transformed to 2,4-diaminotoluene
   (DAT) under anaerobic conditions. Two intermediates,
   2-amino-4-nitrotoluene (2-A-4-NT) and 4-amino-2-nitrotoluene (4-A-2-NT),
   were found during the biotransformation. 2,4-DNT inhibited its own
   biotransformation as well as the acetogenesis of ethanol. The extent of
   the inhibition increased with the increase of the initial concentration
   of 2,4-DNT. Propionate was formed during the fermentation of ethanol
   without 2,4-DNT or with low initial concentrations of 2,4-DNT. Higher
   initial concentrations of 2,4-DNT caused a decrease in the extent of
   formation of propionate with acetate production being favored.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of seed materials from: anaerobically digested sewage
   sludge; sediment from a bleached kraft mill (BKM) aerated lagoon and an
   anaerobic bioreactor biomass treating BKM wastewater were investigated
   as to their potential for dehalogenation of 0.38 mM 2-chlorophenol. In
   batch cultures using a mineral medium containing 0.1\% yeast extract
   under 20\% CO2 + 80\% N-2 or 20\% CO2 + 80\% H-2 atmosphere,
   dehalogenation was observed after extensive lag periods lasting from 97
   to 250 days. Methane was detected in the head-space. Phenol was
   identified as an intermediate which further degraded via the benzoate
   pathway. The dehalogenation rates increased significantly in all
   cultures after re-spiking with 2-CP and yeast extract medium. Cultures
   with digested sewage sludge incubated under CO2/N-2 head-space exhibited
   better dehalogenation rates of 2-CP compared to either the lagoon
   sediment or the bioreactor biomass. Higher dehalogenation rates were
   also observed over CO2/N-2 head-space compared to CO2/H-2 head-space for
   digested sludge. Digested sludge which was adapted to 2-CP over a one
   year period converted 0.38 mM 2-CP to phenol immediately. Degradation of
   2-CP with various dilutions of adapted sludge indicated that
   dehalogenation activity did not increase linearly with biomass
   concentrations. The effect of four different organic electron donors on
   the dehalogenation of 2-CP by adapted sludge revealed that 0.1\% yeast
   extract was preferred by the consortium compared to 10 mM each of
   acetate, propionate or ethanol.}},

Abstract = {{The oxidation of dissolved organic nitrogens (DONs) in natural waters
   using the photocatalytic degradation with titanium dioxide (TiO2) and
   platinized titanium dioxide (Pt/TiO2) is applied to the conventional
   determination of DONs in natural waters. By the photocatalytic
   degradation with TiO2 and Pt/TiO2, DONs were effectively converted to
   inorganic nitrogens such as ammonium, nitrate and nitrite within a
   shorter reaction time compared with the simple photooxidation method
   without catalyst. The photocatalytic activity of Pt/TiO2 was superior to
   that observed with simple TiO2. The ammonium generated from DONs was
   oxidized to nitrite and nitrate under the aerobic condition with
   catalyst. The results of initial formation rates of inorganic nitrogens
   suggested that the nitrate and nitrite were directly generated from
   DONs, in addition to the formation route of nitrate and nitrite via
   ammonium. DONs in natural waters were effectively decomposed to
   inorganic nitrogens, and the concentration of DON in natural waters
   determined by the photocatalytic degradation method was good agreement
   with that determined by the wet oxidation method using persulfate as an
   oxidizing agent. The blank Values observed in the photocatalytic
   degradation method were negligibly small in comparison with the wet
   oxidation method. The oxidation procedure using the TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 was
   powerful method for the determination of DON in natural water.}},

Abstract = {{Taste and odour complaints from consumers are a major problem for
   suppliers of drinking water. Small quantities of chemicals, either
   naturally present in raw water or from industrial sources, or even
   produced during water treatment, can affect the organoleptic properties
   of drinking water. Taste and odour threshold concentrations in water
   were determined for 59 potential drinking water contaminants, including
   pesticides, phenol, chlorinated phenolic compounds and anisoles,
   geosmin, 2-methyl-isoborneol and aluminium sulphate. Panels comprising a
   minimum of six specially selected and trained assessors were used. Taste
   and odour threshold concentrations are presented as geometric means as
   well as the lowest detected concentration; in addition, descriptors are
   reported. Threshold concentrations are also compared with health-based
   limits established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency,
   and drinking water guideline values recommended by the World Health
   Organisation. The results indicated that there was no correlation
   between organoleptic effects of drinking water contaminants and their
   toxicity. Chemicals with the lowest taste and odour threshold values
   included chemicals such as geosmin, 2-methyl-isoborneol and similar
   microbial metabolites, and chlorinated phenols and anisoles.}},

Abstract = {{We examined fate and anaerobic microbial transformation/degradation
   characteristics of atrazine in wetland sediment receiving wastewater
   from local sugar mill. Well-known metabolites/intermediates of atrazine
   were not detected except hydroxyatrazine. Atrazine adsorbed on the
   sediment linearly with a distribution coefficient of 9.979 ml/g.
   Although we did not obtain a direct proof of atrazine mineralization,
   the values of observed yield of total NH3-N were comparable to the
   theoretical values suggesting the biodegradation of atrazine to its end
   products of NH3 and CO2. Only about 20\% of atrazine was biotransformed
   to non-triazine species, possibly to the mineral end products, after 38
   weeks of incubation in the sample reactors without organic amendments,
   with methanol and sodium acetate. Acetic acid appeared to enhance the
   biotransformation of atrazine (both in aqueous and sediment phases) if
   one only measured the parent atrazine compound alone. However, a
   comprehensive analysis of atrazine and its metabolites/intermediates
   showed that most of the disappeared atrazine existed as hydroxyatrazine.
   Glucose improved the wetland sediment's removal rate of the triazine
   species.}},

Abstract = {{An Ajar sour gas engine was used to control the biogas odour from an
   anaerobic digester and to generate electrical power. The 65\% methane
   biogas was analysed for hydrogen sulphide by Drager tubes and
   organosulphide compounds by GC-MS. Only low molecular weight sulphur
   compounds contributed to the odour of the biogas. The hydrogen sulphide
   concentrations averaged 13,700 mg m(-3) and methyl mercaptan 0.277 mg
   m(-3), in the biogas and the Ajar engine reduced these to 6.1 and 0.015
   mg m(-3), respectively. Dilution of the biogas by air in the engine,
   together with oxidation during combustion, accounted for the lowering of
   the hydrogen sulphide concentration. There was no oxidation of the
   mercaptan. Tuning the engine to provide a slightly lean burn reduced
   hydrogen sulphide concentration to 2.7 mg m(-3). A simple stack
   dispersion model indicates that a further tenfold reduction in exhaust
   concentration at ground level can be achieved by a 5 m chimney and a
   100-fold reduction from a 15 m chimney. The higher chimney gives
   concentrations around the odour threshold of hydrogen sulphide.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) by Arthrobacter strain ATCC 33790
   naturally immobilized on glass beads in a column was studied. PCP was
   removed from mineral salts medium 4-5 d after inoculation of the column
   with PCP-acclimated cells grown in batch culture. Adherence to the glass
   occurred with production of extracellular polymer. The laboratory
   reactor operated without aseptic precaution for over 300 d employing a
   feed containing 12-366 mg/l PCP as the predominant carbon source.
   Transient studies were done with both ammonia and nitrate in the feed.
   With ammonia in the feed the system lost its ability to respond
   effectively to step increases in PCP feed concentration from 12-170 mg/l
   within 4 months. After 6 months, even at very low flow rate, the column
   was unable to efficiently remove PCP after 2 abrupt increases in
   hydraulic load. The presence of 120 mg/l nitrite in the effluent
   indicated that nitrification caused deterioration in column performance.
   Replacement of the ammonia in the feed with nitrate reestablished PCP
   removal efficiency. Effluent concentrations were typically less than 1
   mg/l with 20 mg/l in the feed. In transient studies the amplitude of
   response to 5 step increases in feed concentration of 20-150 mg/l
   decreased in time from 91.5 to 11 mg/l. The column responded well to a
   step increase from 20 to 366 mg/l but was stunned following a subsequent
   step change from 20 to 1000 mg/l.}},

Abstract = {{The involvement of Acinetobacter in biological excess phosphate removal
   from the activated sludge process is widely accepted, though its role is

   junii (10(4), 10(5), 10(6), 10(7), 10(8) cells . ml(-1) initial biomass)
   were used as inoculum in a mixed liquor medium containing sodium
   acetate. The phosphate uptake capacity was dependent on the biomass
   concentration. Low initial biomass concentrations triggered the release
   of phosphate once transferred into the mixed liquor. Release of
   phosphate increased during active growth and uptake occurred when cells
   reached the stationary growth phase. High initial biomass concentration
   of Acinetobacter junii (10(8) cells . ml(-1)) resulted in uptake of
   phosphate during the entire duration of the experiment leading
   eventually to complete phosphate removal.}},

Abstract = {{The anaerobic digestion of waste water containing significant levels of
   coffee grounds was assessed in mesophilic and thermophilic batch studies
   and CSTRs fed daily. A 58\% reduction in VS was seen in both batch
   studies. Proximate compositional analysis showed that the waste had a
   high lipid component (26-33\%). Levels of lipid, hemicellulose,
   alpha-cellulose and lignin were determined before and after digestion.
   These components were reduced as follows: lipid by 87\% in the
   mesophilic study and 65\% in the thermophilic study, alpha-cellulose by
   51\% in both mesophilic and thermophilic batch studies, hemicellulose by
   22\% in the mesophilic studies and 64\% in the thermophilic studies. The
   lignin component was not reduced in either study. Mesophilic continuous
   digestion was achieved at a loading rate of 1.3 kg COD m(-3) day(-1) (25
   day HRT) for 99 days. Addition of sodium bicarbonate alone was not
   sufficient for long term anaerobic digestion. Addition of Ca(OH)(2),
   nitrogen, phosphorus and trace elements, however, gave successful
   digestion with COD and VS removal of 60\% and a gas production rate of
   0.34 1 1(-1) day(-1) (65-70\% methane). Low levels of TVFA and high
   levels of bicarbonate alkalinity were present. Thermophilic digestion
   could be established at 1.6 kg COD m(-3) day(-1) (20 day HRT) with the
   addition of sodium bicarbonate alone, or Ca(OH)(2) with nitrogen,
   phosphorus and trace elements. However long term digestion could not be
   established beyond 50 days without a increase in TVFA occurring.}},

   petrological features of Etna volcanics, are enriched in certain
   chemical species (i,e. HCO3-, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and many trace elements).
   This is mainly due to the interaction between ground waters and volcanic
   gases, mainly CO2, that are present in the underground atmosphere. CO2
   is dissolved into water thus making it very aggressive towards the host
   volcanic rocks so that cations are gradually brought into solution. Mg,
   Mn, Fe and V concentrations above the Maximum Admissible Concentrations
   (MACs) fixed by the European standards were found in most of the potable
   waters of Etna, especially in those from its eastern and western flanks,
   where the amount of CO2 dissolved in the ground water is greatest.
   Therefore, about 700,000 people have used potable waters with Mg
   contents exceeding the European MACs, 90,000 have used those with Mn
   exceeding MACs, 63,000 have used those with Fe exceeding MACs and more
   than 600,000 have used waters with V above the EPA acceptability level.
   Considering that these elements are essential for humans and that Mg, Mn
   and Fe contents in Etna. waters account for only a small percentage of
   their total dietary intake it is unlikely that direct health
   consequences can derive from drinking such waters. As this problem can
   be present in all the geographical areas where waters are naturally
   enriched in dissolved minerals, a revision of current standards for
   drinking waters is desirable.}},

Abstract = {{The 2.5-h LC(50) values (C) of chlorophenols in goldfish, Carassius
   auratus were determined at pH 7.0, and taking the effect of dissociation
   into account, each of the values was divided into the concentrations of
   both undissociated form (C-n) and dissociated form (C-i). The increase
   of the chlorine atom number in chlorophenols enhanced the toxicity to
   fish, whereas in the chlorophenols having the same number of chlorine
   atoms, the toxicity decreased in the order of non-, mono- and
   di-ortho-chlorophenols. The log 1/C values were closely correlated with
   the log P-ow values (r = 0.948). A good linear correlation (r = 0.943)
   was also observed between log 1/C-n and log P-ow, whereas the log 1/C-i
   was not correlated with the log P-ow (r = 0.186). These results
   suggested that the toxicity is enhanced by the enhanced lipophilic
   property with increasing number of chlorine atoms, and the undissociated
   form plays an important role in the transfer of chlorophenols from media
   to the site of action. A good linear correlation was observed between
   log 1/C and Delta pK(a) (pK(a) of phenol - pK(a) of each chlorophenol)
   in three groups of non-, mono- and di-ortho-chlorophenols in parallel.
   This result suggested that the enhanced toxicity with increasing number
   of chlorine atoms is attributed to not only the increased lipophilic
   property as described above but also the reduced electron density of the
   OH group, whereas in chlorophenols having the same number of chlorine
   atoms, the reduced toxicity in the order of non- mono- and
   di-ortho-chlorophenols is attributed to the reduction of reactivity of
   the OH group owing to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bond
   between the OH group and the chlorine atom substituted at the
   ortho-position.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of the toxicity of chlorophenols in fish was investigated
   through the relation between the toxicity in vivo and each of P-ow, and
   Delta pK(a) (pK(a) of phenol - pK(a) of each chlorophenol). The acute
   toxicity of chlorophenols in goldfish, Carassius auratus, was evaluated
   as 5-h LC(50) in media (W) and 5-h LC(50) in vivo (V). The 1/W value
   steeply increased with increasing number of chlorine atoms, while the
   1/V value gradually increased. The log 1/V was linearly correlated with
   log P-ow (r = 0.914). A linear correlation of r = 0.805 was observed
   between log 1/V and Delta pK(a). Taking the effect of dissociation into
   account, each of the V values was divided into the concentrations of
   undissociated form (V-n) and dissociated form (V-i). In grouping
   chlorophenols on the basis of the position of chlorine atoms
   substituted, a good linear relationship was observed between log 1/V-n
   and Delta pK(a) in each group in parallel. On the other hand, such a
   relationship was not observed between log 1/V-n and Delta pK(a). The
   parallel linear relationships showed that the suppressed magnitude of
   the interaction between the undissociated chlorophenols and the site of
   action increases in the order of 4-CP < 3-CP < 3,5-DCP < 2-CP < 2,4-DCP
   < 2,3-DCP is-approximately-equal-to 2,5-DCP < 2,4,5-TCP < 2,6-DCP
   is-approximately-equal-to 2,4,6-TCP is-approximately-equal-to
   2,3,4,6-TCP is-approximately-equal-to PCP, i.e. the suppressed magnitude
   increased with the closing of the chlorine atom position to the OH
   group. From these results, it was concluded that chlorophenols are
   transferred from media to the site of action in fish mainly by the
   passive diffusion of their undissociated forms through various
   biological membranes, and that the OH group of their undissociated forms
   interacts with the site, resulting in the occurrence of the toxicity in
   fish.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-segment model of chemical fate and transport in the Bay of
   Quinte and a food chain model that simulate average annual conditions,
   are used to examine the behavior of arsenic (As), pentachlorophenol
   (PCP) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the Bay, an `'Area of
   Concern'' in the Great Lakes. The Bay model was used to predict the
   status of As and PCP from known loading data, but for PCBs with unknown
   loadings, the Bay and food chain models were used to `'back-calculate''
   total loadings to the Bay. Chemical behavior depends on the
   characteristics of the Bay and physical-chemical properties of
   chemicals. Short water residence times of less than a week to several
   months result in chemicals being advected, unless subject to other, more
   rapid processes. In Upper Bay, rapid rates of sediment deposition and
   resuspension retard losses by advection of persistent chemicals such as
   PCBs and As, despite As being largely dissolved in the water column.
   Overall, behavior in Upper Bay is dominated by sediment-water exchange,
   and in Lower Bay by water exchange with Lake Ontario. Because of PCP's
   rapid transformation rate in the water column, most chemical is
   transformed before it reaches the sediments or downstream segments. It
   is recommended that elevated As inputs from the Moira River must be
   controlled to reduce in-Bay water and sediment concentrations, and for
   PCP, industrial discharges must be reduced. If reduced, concentrations
   in the Bay would respond within 3 months, I month and 3 years in the
   water, and about 6, 3 and 10 years in sediments for As, PCP and PCBs,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Aeromonas veronii was isolated from seleniferous agricultural drainage
   water and characterized in terms of growth kinetics under changing
   environmental parameters {[}i.e, pH, selenium (Se) and salinity
   (electrical conductivity, EC)] that simulated evaporation. Aeromonas
   veronii metabolized peptone and was active in volatilizing Se,
   principally as dimethyl selenide (DMSe). Other volatile products
   produced included dimethyl disulfide, methyl selenol, dimethyl
   selenosulfide and dimethyl diselenide. The rate of Se volatilization
   correlated with the growth of A. veronii, with the highest levels of
   DMSe released during the exponential phase of growth. The C assimilated
   was primarily respired as CO, or incorporated into cell biomass with a
   small fraction used in the alkylation of Se. The maximum growth rate
   (mu(max)) for A. veronii was 0.23 h(-1) at pH 7.94, 10 mu g Se l(-1),
   and EC of 3.9 dS m(-1) and decreased to 0.06 h(-1) with increasing salt
   content (40.2 dS m(-1)), pH (8.53) and Se (500 mu gl(-1)). Salinity
   appeared to be the dominant inhibitory factor as observed by a decrease
   in growth rate and mass of cells. The range in salt content that was
   most inhibitory to the growth rate of A. veronii was from EC 11.7 to
   40.2 dS m(-1). As drainage waters evaporate in holding facilities,
   salinity tends to increase having serious ecological effects on the
   growth of A. veronii.}},

Title = {{Nonlinear deflection of polypropylene hollow fiber membranes in
   transverse flow}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The mass transfer coefficient (K-L) for oxygen transfer in a hollow
   fiber module with liquid flow normal to the fiber is much higher than
   for modules with flow parallel to the fibers. In the transverse flow
   modules studied, individually sealed fibers are mounted vertically at
   the bottom of a channel with water flow horizontally past the fibers. As
   a result, the free standing fibers deflect in the flow, like vertical
   cantilever beams subjected to uniform horizontal force. With this module
   configuration, a high mass transfer coefficient can be achieved at low
   liquid flow rates resulting in a more energy efficient process. Previous
   studies have shown that heat and mass transfer coefficients strongly
   depend on the orientation of the fibers with respect to the flow
   direction. The objective of this paper is to present a model for
   predicting the deflected shape of hollow fibers in a transverse flow
   module based on the flexural strength of the membrane material and the
   loading conditions. The modulus of elasticity (E) of the fiber material,
   measured by conducting conventional stress-strain tests, was correlated
   to the deflected shape of the fiber. The experimental value of E was
   verified by allowing the fibers to bend under their own weight. The
   predicted deflection of the fibers showed close agreement with the
   observed profile. Experiments were also performed to investigate the
   deflection of the fibers in the flowing water. The observed curvature of
   the fibers matched the predicted deflection well.}},

Abstract = {{A novel sealed-end transverse how hollow fiber membrane module was
   evaluated for aeration of water. In this process the scaled-end fibers
   were held vertically from the bottom of a channel. Purr oxygen under
   high pressure was maintained in the fiber, The water to be aerated was
   pumped over the outside of the fibers. Due to the concentration
   gradient, oxygen transferred through the air-filled pores and dissolved
   directly into the water without forming bubbles, Since the primary
   orientation of the fiber is perpendicular to the liquid Row, a high mass
   transfer coefficient was achieved at low liquid velocities compared to
   parallel flow modules. Measured mass transfer coefficients for hollow
   fibers held at different angles arf:presented in this paper. In
   addition, the design equations for transverse-flow aerators are
   developed. The mass transfer behavior of a small scale transverse-flow
   bubblesless hollow fiber membrane module was measured experimentally and
   the results were compared with the theoretical predictions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the effects of temperature and pH on the growth of
   heterotrophic bacteria in Chlorella vulgaris-heterotrophic bacteria
   culture. The growth of heterotrophic bacteria was studied at 10, 15, 20
   and 30 degrees C, and pH was controlled from 3.0 to 11.5 in a series of
   fed-batch chemostat reactors supplied with glucose as the sole source of
   carbon. Samples were analyzed for heterotrophic bacteria by tryptone
   glucose extract agar in triplicate. The agar pH of 7.0 was the best for
   enumeration of heterotrophic bacteria. The bacteria grown at pH near
   neutral were more sensitive to the variation of agar pH than those grown
   at very alkaline pH. No significant difference in the number of cells
   capable of forming colonies was noted for incubation temperature of 20
   and 35 degrees C, but the lag time for colony formation was longer at 20
   degrees C. Samples for enumeration of heterotrophic bacteria collected
   from algal-bacterial systems such as waste stabilization ponds are
   recommended to be incubated at 35 degrees C for 72 h. Depending on the
   pH of the culture, about 86-98\% of the cells capable of forming
   colonies will be visible to the naked eyes after incubation at 35
   degrees C for 72 h. At the steady state conditions, heterotrophic
   bacteria were not sensitive to temperature in the range of 10-20 degrees
   C. However, at 30 degrees C, a notable competition for glucose between
   Chlorella vulgaris and heterotrophic bacteria was observed. This
   competition was responsible for the low bacterial density near neutral
   pH. No evidence was found to support the view that the discharge of
   bactericidal substances from Chlorella vulgaris was responsible for
   reduction of heterotrophic bacteria at high pH.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a technique for estimating kinetic parameters (k,
   K-s and. S-min) and average diffusivity (If) of Assimilable Organic
   Carbon (AOC) For biofilm processes used in water treatment. A beach
   scale column containing glass beads operated in the recycle mode was
   used as a steady-state bioreactor and fed either synthetic or ozonated
   natural water. The error-in-variables algorithm was employed for
   parameter estimation. The jackknife technique was used to obtain
   confidence intervals for the parameters. The estimates for k, S-min and
   D were in the expected range of values, Estimated K-s values were higher
   than expected, but tended to support parameter estimates obtained from a
   previous pilot scale study.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption of vanadium (IV) by chitosan, a naturally occurring
   material, is studied according to equilibrium and kinetics. Sorption
   isotherms are determined and single mechanisms of diffusion are studied.
   These are regarded as the main limiting steps. The parameters studied
   are: pH, the initial metal concentration, the particle size of the
   polymer and the stirring speed. While the fourth parameter has no effect
   on overall sorption performances, equilibrium and kinetics are greatly
   influenced by the other three. The speciation of metal in solution,
   relative to pH and total metal concentration, plays an important part in
   the separation factor between the solid and liquid phases, and on the
   diffusion of solute through the polymer surface. It has been
   demonstrated that the sorption, in the case of chitosan is mainly
   located on the surface. The diffusion mechanisms are both external and
   intraparticle phenomena: but diffusion is restricted to a thin layer of
   the particle. An increase of the particle size results in a greater time
   to reach equilibrium. The Langmuir and Freundlich models show relative
   correlations difficult to estimate considering to the pseudo rectangular
   isotherm obtained: the equilibrium plateau is quickly reached.}},

Abstract = {{Microcystin-LR is a potent mammalian toxin which is known to have been
   responsible for the deaths of domesticated animals, and consequently
   there is concern as to its environmental fate. In laboratory experiments
   conducted using low levels (10 mu g l(-1)) of microcystin-LR in
   reservoir water, primary biodegradation of the toxin was shown to occur
   in less than 1 week. An experiment designed to ascertain the degree of
   mineralisation of microcystin-LR, using natural microbial populations
   under aerobic conditions, showed that the peptide ring appears to be
   fairly resistant to biodegradation, as the degree of mineralisation was
   not high. However, as the toxicity of microcystin LR is critically
   dependent on the orientation of the peptide ring with respect to the
   `'Adda'' (the beta-amino acid which is unique to the blue-green algal
   toxins) side-chain, and it appears that this side chain is affected
   during biodegradation, it seems likely that a reduction in toxicity
   occurs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the hydraulic design of peripheral channels for circular
   tanks is based on a solution of the gradually varied flow equation for
   spatially varied flow. The maximum depth of flow in the channel is
   obtained for a range of channel widths namely 300, 500, 750 and 1000 mm,
   channel bed slopes 0,0.2\%, and 0.5\%, surface loadings of 30, 50 and 70
   m(3)/m(2) d and tank sizes from 10 m diameter up to 40 m diameter. The
   results are presented in graphical and tabular form with the maximum
   depth of flow given for the complete range of tank diameters, surface
   loadings, channel widths and slopes, In addition, typical flow profile
   are obtained which show that the maximum depth reduces with increasing
   bed slope of channel and the position of maximum depth moves downstream
   towards the outfall as the gradient increases from zero up to 0.5\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses manganese removal from water by filtration through
   low cost coarse media. A laboratory scale filtration technique was used
   to remove manganese from manganese bearing water to prove previous batch
   studies which showed that the removal of manganese was better in the
   case of limestone particle as compared to the gravel, crushed brick or
   with no media addition, and the conclusion made that removal mechanisms
   were due to the effect of rough solid surfaces and the presence of
   carbonate in the limestone particle. Filtration results indicated that
   at an input pH of 7 with manganese concentration of 1 Mn/l, a good
   removal was observed in the limestone media as compared to the gravel
   media, which validates the batch results. Results also show that water
   hardness did not significantly increase in this filtration technique.
   Studies on the effect of different parameters on the removal performance
   of manganese has shown that a smaller particle size, a greater filter
   depth, and a lower flow rate gave advantages in the removal efficiency.}},

   cause of acute renal failure in children. The purpose of this study was
   to investigate the presence of E. coli O157 in drinking and recreational
   water samples from Northern Greece. For this, a total of 1974 colonies
   of E. call that were isolated from 1267 water samples were recultured on
   sorbitol-MacConkey agar. Out of them 121 were found non-sorbitol
   fermenting, but none had the somatic O157 antigen. This finding supports

Abstract = {{Positive effects of protozoa on carbon mineralization by bacteria are
   considered here specifically in the context of waste-water treatment.
   The following effects are reviewed: (1) changes in the C:N:P ratio of
   the substrate; (2) excretion of growth factors; and (3) grazing.
   Depending on the composition of the substrate, grazing can stimulate
   biological breakdown of carbon. Substrate with a high carbon-nutrient
   ratio permits mineralization increase due to grazing, while
   mineralization is not enhanced when the substrate has a low
   carbon-nutrient ratio. The effects of growth factors and grazing depend
   on several processes. The availability of bacteria for suspension
   feeders might be under-estimated. A study concerning the exchange
   between bacteria in the suspended liquor and bacteria growing in a floc
   or biofilm is highlighted.}},

   was studied in a series of laboratory experiments. Equilibrium
   conditions for sorption and desorption were established within 5 min

   observed at up to 80 mu g/l of dissolved PCP at pH 6, and up to 160 mu
   g/l at pH 8. Linear sorption coefficients were primarily influenced by
   pH, although ionic strength (owing to pH-buffering) and the
   concentration of dissolved organic matter also had an impact. The
   influence of these factors was quantified by a simple mathematical
   model, which included separate sorption coefficients for the neutral and

Abstract = {{Landfill leachate was treated in upflow hybrid (sludge-bed/fixed-bed)
   anaerobic reactors by both methanogenic digestion and by
   sulphate-reducing digestion. Steady state removal efficiencies of COD
   under methanogenic digestion was 81-97\%, depending upon organic loading
   rate; and effective treatment occurred up to a volumetric COD loading
   rate of 3.75 kg COD . m(-3). d(-1). In sulphate-reducing digesters SO42-
   was converted stoichiometrically to dissolved H2S, driving organic
   matter mineralization. Sulphate concentrations of 35, 105 and 175 mM in
   the feed resulted in SO42- removal efficiencies of 92, 52 and 35\%
   respectively. Steady state removal efficiencies of organic COD in the
   sulphate-reducing digesters averaged 62\% at 35 mM, 80\% at 105 mM, and
   84\% at 175 mM feed SO42- concentrations. The ratio of COD:SO42- (g/g)
   utilized was dependent upon the concentration of SO42- present, and at
   35 M SO42- was 0.67. At an organic loading rate <1 kg COD . m(-3). d(-1)
   the sulphate-reducing digesters offered organic removal efficiencies
   comparable to methanogenic digesters, but were less effective at higher
   loading rates. Propionate accounted for the majority of the residual COD
   in the effluents from the methanogenic digesters, but acetate in the
   effluent from the sulphate-reducing digesters. Removal of sulphide from
   the reactors was achieved by addition of iron and by gassing off
   sulphide, but there was no increase in COD removal after sulphide
   removal which indicated that sulphide toxicity was not significant. Both
   methanogenic and sulphate-reducing reactors completely removed up to 100
   ppm Cu, Mn, Ni and Zn added in the feed, indicating that even
   methanogenic reactors produce sufficient sulphide to precipitate these
   metals completely.}},

Abstract = {{The behaviour of various persistent metabolites derived from nonylphenol
   polyethoxylate (NPnEO) surfactants was studied during infiltration of
   river water to groundwater at two field sites situated in the northern
   part of Switzerland (Glatt River and Sitter River). Nonylphenol (NP),
   nonylphenol monoethoxylate (NP1EO), nonylphenol diethoxylate (NP2EO),
   nonylphenoxy acetic acid (NP1EC) and nonylphenoxy(ethoxy) acetic acid
   (NP2EC) were observed in the two investigated rivers at relatively high
   concentrations with average values of the individual types of
   nonylphenolic compounds ranging from 1.8 to 25 mu g/l. The average
   concentrations of NP, NP1EO and NP2EO in groundwater were significantly
   lower (range <0.1-1 mu g/l) suggesting an efficient elimination of these
   compounds during infiltration. In contrast, the elimination of
   nonylphenoxy carboxylic acids was less efficient. Most of the observed
   elimination occurred in the first 2.5 m of the aquifer, while further
   decrease in concentration was rather slow. In one sampling period,
   residual concentrations of nonylphenolic compounds up to 7.2 mu g/l were
   detected in a pumping station used for drinking water supply which is
   situated 130 m from the Glatt River bed. Concentrations of NP, NP1EO and
   NP2EO in both river water and groundwater showed a pronounced seasonal
   variability with higher values observed during winter. The data suggest
   that low temperatures, which prevail in winter, significantly reduce the
   elimination efficiency of NP and to a lesser extent of NP1EO, while the
   behaviour of NP2EO was not affected. Such a behaviour indicates biogical
   transformation as the responsible elimination process. A comparison of
   average elimination efficiences of nonylphenolic compounds with those of
   pentachlorphenol (PCP) and nitrilotriacetate (NTA) gives the following
   sequence: NTA greater than or equal to NP2EO > NP1EO > NP > PCP > NP1EC
   = NP2EC.}},

Abstract = {{Survival of Vibrio cholerae O1 ATCC 14035 in seawater was studied,
   employing laboratory microcosms of 3.5\% salinity and transfer of cells
   from growth media of different osmotic strengths. Cells previously grown
   in M9 mineral medium amended with 0.5 M sucrose showed a decrease of 2
   log units in number of culturable cells, after exposure to seawater for
   10-12 days, the number of culturable cells remaining unchanged during
   the next 50 days. When pregrown in M9 medium, or in M9 amended with 0.5
   M NaCl, the number of culturable cells decreased 3 and 5 log units,
   respectively, then increased to the same concentration as cells grown in
   sucrose. Morphological changes were observed, depending on the medium
   employed. Results of the study showed that V. cholerae ATCC 14035 can
   remain in the culturable state in seawater for a relatively long time,
   i.e. sufficiently long to be carried by ocean currents to widely distant
   geographical locations.}},

Title = {{Kinetics of denitrification reactions in single sludge systems}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1996}},

Pages = {{51-56}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports denitrification studies performed using the anoxic
   reactor of a laboratory scale anoxic-aerobic plant as a batch reactor of
   variable volume. This was achieved by adding to the anoxic reactor a
   supplementary flow of nitrate after the shut down of the recirculation
   line and the interruption of the hydraulic connection to the aerobic
   reactor. By operating in this way, in a relatively short time, it is
   possible to get a number of experimental data sufficient to describe the
   biological process kinetics. The system is extremely flexible and gives
   kinetic data in short times for different experimental conditions. In
   fact, it is possible to operate at different COD/NO3-N ratios simply by
   changing the influent wastewater flowrate to the anoxic reactor. Two
   series of tests were performed: in the first series (use of endogenous
   carbon) a supplementary flow of nitrate was fed to the anoxic reactor
   while the wastewater influent flow was interrupted; in the second series
   (use of internal carbon) the influent wastewater flow was fed during the
   addition of nitrate. The importance of the carbonaceous substrate nature
   on the denitrification rate was also verified. Data analysis was
   performed by utilizing the integral method procedure and a zero order
   kinetics referring to both the substrates COD and nitrate nitrogen was
   considered. A satisfactory agreement between predicted and experimental
   data was found. Values obtained for k(D) range from 0.07 mg NO3-N/mg VSS
   . d, at which the carbon source is mostly endogenous, to 0.25 mg
   NO3-N/mg VSS . d, at which the carbon source consists mainly of readily
   biodegradable GOD. Intermediate values occur when the readily
   biodegradable COD is limiting and denitrification takes place by
   utilizing the slowly biodegradable one.}},

Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{63-74}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A numerical model predicting the transport and fate of contaminants in
   estuaries has been developed and tested. The modelling framework allows
   for (1) advection and diffusion of contaminants in the dissolved phase,
   (2) partitioning of contaminants between the dissolved and adsorbed
   phases, (3) input of adsorbed contaminants to the water column due to
   the resuspension of bed sediment, (4) accumulation of contaminants in
   the bed sediment due to deposition of suspended sediment and (5) in the
   case of organic contaminants, losses due to volatilization and
   biodegradation. Particle-water interactions throughout the estuary are
   encoded using relationships between empirically-derived partition
   coefficients and salinity, which have been coupled to an established
   two-dimensional depth integrated hydrodynamic and sediment model
   configured for the Humber Estuary, England, to simulate the
   distributions and transport of cadmium and zinc. The model has been run
   for a range of tidal and river flow conditions, and has been calibrated
   against field measurements of hydrodynamic parameters, salinity,
   suspended sediment concentrations and dissolved trace metal
   conentrations, and validated using independent dissolved trace metal
   data sets. The application of the model is discussed to a wide range of
   estuaries where the fate of trace metal contaminants is of immediate
   concern.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of a glycogen accumulating population and its abilities of
   substrate uptake and storage in anaerobic-aerobic activated sludge fed
   with mainly acetate were investigated. Because a low phosphorus/carbon
   feeding ratio (2/100, wt/wt) was used to suppress the growth of
   polyphosphate-accumulating bacteria, the sludge exhibited no biological
   phosphorus removal activity. Still, under anaerobic conditions, acetate,
   propionate, butyrate, valerate, pyruvate, lactate, most key
   intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and gluconate were taken
   up and stored as polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA); and glucose, fructose,
   maltose, sucrose, trehalose, and raffinose as cellular glycogen and PHA.
   The energy and reducing equivalents required for the carbon uptake and
   storage were generated from the glycolysis of either cellular glycogen
   or a sugar taken up. Results of substrate uptake further suggested that
   the sludge preferred to utilize glucose instead of cellular glycogen as
   an energy source during acids uptake. Different morphological types of
   bacteria with deposits of cellular PHA granules after substrate uptake
   were observed as the majority in the sludge, suggesting that they could
   assimilate or possibly scavenge most of the dissolved substrate of the
   waste water and dominate in the deteriorated biological phosphorus
   removal processes.}},

   that affect the dynamics of various forms of phosphorus in the lake.
   These mechanisms include stratification, partitioning of total

   and algal uptake and recycle. This paper analyzes the mechanisms,
   performance, and reliability of several total phosphorus models for

Abstract = {{With recognizing that particles represent transport vehicles for
   undesirable chemical contaminants, and potentially disease causing
   microbial pathogens, the removal of particle materials becomes important
   to protect the public health. However, due to the complicated filtration
   mechanisms and interactions between the polymer and particles, the
   selection of polymers currently remains empirical. This study was
   initiated to investigate the feasibility of the use of polymers as
   filter aids for water containing lime softening particles; explore the
   roles of polymer characteristics in the filtration process; and examine
   major factors affecting the performance of polymer aided filtration.
   Seven representative polymers with different molecular weights and
   charges were tested using a declining rate filter pilot plant. The
   results show that at a starting flow rate of 15 m/h, the removal of
   turbidity particles could be significantly improved by using polymers as
   a filter aid. It was also found that the impacts of initial filter
   ripening could be substantially reduced and no turbidity breakthrough
   was observed after 3 days of operation. However, the use of polymer
   might significantly increase the filtration headless, especially for the
   polymers with high molecular weight. To produce a high quality filtrate
   while ensuring the acceptable filtration productivity, low or moderately
   low molecular weight polymers are recommended. For a low molecular
   weight polymer, its optimum mixing intensity and polymer dose were found
   around 700 s(-1) and 0.01 mg/l, respectively. On the basis of the
   results and particle properties, it is believed that interparticle
   bridging is the dominant mechanism underlying the interactions between
   polymers and lime softening particles.}},

Abstract = {{Rhodamine B adsorption was used to measure the specific surface area of
   activated sludge. The surface area occupied by the Rhodamine B molecule
   was calibrated by measuring its adsorption onto polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
   granules. The area occupied was found to be dependent on pH and
   conductivity of the solution. To verify the measurements other uniform
   materials were used. The surface area of wood flour and an activated
   carbon were measured with satisfactory results. Micropores (<2 nm) are
   excluded from the determination. As a representation of a uniform
   biological suspension yeast was used. The surface area measured by
   Rhodamine B was compared with a surface area calculated from a number
   based size distribution. The results showed that it was possible to
   measure the specific surface area of a biological material with the
   method described. The specific surface area of activated sludge and

Abstract = {{The speciation of EDTA in sewage effluents leaving wastewater treatment
   plants determines its ultimate fate in natural surface waters, since
   only the Fe(III)-EDTA complex (FeEDTA) is quickly degraded by direct
   photolysis, whereas other EDTA species are very slowly transformed, if
   at all, by biological or chemical processes. Field studies were
   undertaken to quantify the speciation of EDTA in influents and effluents
   of sewage treatment plants. Chemical equilibrium calculations are of
   only limited use for this purpose because several weeks are needed to
   reach thermodynamic equilibrium in wastewater due to slow metal exchange
   processes. In the effluents from treatment plants that precipitate
   phosphate, concentrations of dissolved Fe (0.05 mu m- and 0.45 mu
   m-filterable) correlated with the concentrations of EDTA. An operational
   scheme, using sunlight or artificial light sources for specific
   photoconversion of FeEDTA species, was applied to distinguish between
   photo-degradable (=FeEDTA) and photo-resistent EDTA species. Field
   studies conducted at three municipal wastewater treatment facilities
   showed that EDTA speciation changes from the input to the output because
   FeEDTA is formed from other metal-EDTA complexes after addition of
   iron(II)-containing solutions into the aeration tanks. With respect to
   total amounts of EDTA, fractions of FeEDTA in the influents and
   effluents varied from 10 to 55\% and from 20 to 90\%. Mass balances
   comprising sampling periods of several days showed that no significant
   elimination of EDTA occured by biological or chemical processes during
   sewage treatment, whereas the chemically related phosphate substitute
   nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) was efficiently degraded (>90\%). As long as
   the speciation of EDTA in wastewaters is dominated by FeEDTA, and
   aerobic conditions are maintained, the remobilization of common heavy
   metals out of sewage sludge is unlikely to occur.}},

Abstract = {{The acute toxicity of five heavy metals to the protozoan community
   inhabiting the activated sludge of a waste treatment plant, was
   determined on the basis of reduction in both cell density and species
   richness. The activated sludge mixed-liquor was treated with different
   concentrations of cadmium, copper, chromium (VI), lead, and zinc for a
   period of 24-h. The experimental results enabled to determine the
   relative toxicity of the tested metals, and indicated that the order of
   toxicity of the five metals to the studied microbial community was
   generally: Cd, Cu > Pb > Zn > Cr. For nine out of sixteen protozoan
   species constituting the studied community was possible to determine the
   24-h median lethal concentration (24-h LC(50)) for each tested metal.
   Large differences appeared in sensitivities of the nine species to the
   metals. Ciliated protozoa such as Chilodonella uncinata and Trochilia
   minuta showed the highest sensitivity to all the studied metals, while
   Opercularia coarctata and O. minima, were the most tolerant species.}},

Abstract = {{The Bio-Denipho(R) process, a `'phased isolation ditch'' technology,
   varies both aeration pattern and flow path in a continuous flow
   multi-reactor system to force oscillation of organic and nutrient
   concentrations in process reactors. Using a six-phase cycle, desired
   biochemical transformations (e.g. nitrification, denitrification), are
   accomplished at different times in the same reactor. We used an
   industry-standard biokinetic model (IAWPRC) to develop and test three
   control strategies of increasing sophistication: (a) fixed phase
   lengths, (b) use of constant set points to switch between phases thus
   resulting in variable phase lengths, and (c) use of switching set points
   which are a function of on-line measurements (criteria functions). These
   strategies were optimized for nominal diurnal operating conditions, with
   the objective of minimizing effluent soluble nitrogen, subject to an
   upper bound on the oxygen transfer coefficient. In addition, performance
   of the strategies was simulated against 1-, 2-, and 5-day sustained peak
   loads. Under nominal diurnal conditions, the performance obtained with
   each strategy was comparable. Under peak loading conditions, both of the
   switching set point strategies gave substantially better performance
   than the fixed phase length strategy. Criteria functions were marginally
   better than constant switch points.}},

Abstract = {{A simulated high-strength industrial wastewater containing acetate,
   phenol, and orthochlorophenol (2-CP) was treated using an anaerobic
   fluidized-bed granular activated carbon (GAC) reactor. Although carbon
   replacement was initiated to maintain the effluent quality from the
   reactor and to minimize the inhibitory effects of 2-CP, the latter phase
   of this study demonstrated that carbon replacement was not necessary. A
   large pulse input of organic feed was introduced to investigate the
   resilience of the reactor to severe and sudden increases in influent
   organic loading. With appropriate pH adjustment, the reactor stabilized
   within less than two days. A mathematical model was developed to
   investigate the interaction between the adsorption and biodegradation of
   compounds in the reactor during the large pulse input. The model
   confirmed that the GAC was instrumental in controlling the buildup of
   2-CP in the reactor.}},

   Mg3AlO4(OH) (HT500) for 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) from water solution.
   The adsorption behaviour of TNP was investigated at diverse
   solid/solution ratios, pH and TNP concentration by batch equilibration
   technique. The L and H type adsorption isotherms obtained in those
   sorbents respectively indicated a chemisorption process which was
   irreversible and fitted the Langmuir equation model well. Sorption
   capacity and energy were found to be very high for HT500. The X-ray
   diffraction and IR spectroscopy techniques applied to TNP-HT and
   TNP-HT500 products indicate that anionic TNP is adsorbed by anion
   exchange in the interlayer of HT to 20\% of the anion exchange capacity
   (AEC) and, by reconstruction of the layered structure on HT500, to 40\%
   of the AEC. The results suggested the potential use of HT500 as a tilter
   for TNP, being also easily recyclable.}},

Abstract = {{The treatment of olive oil mill effluents (OME), even when performed
   with the most appropriate technology (i.e. anaerobic digestion) meets
   great difficulties in reaching the depuration efficiencies required by
   national regulations all over the Mediterranean area. This paper was
   aimed at gaining better insight into the degradation of the main
   compounds contained in the OME; in particular, the interaction between
   the two successive stages occurring in the anaerobic digestion, the
   acidogenesis and the methanogenesis, was investigated. First of all, the
   best operating conditions were identified. Most of the lipids were
   degraded both in acidogenesis and methanogenesis tests. On the other
   hand, polyphenol-like substances were not degraded at all in acidogenic
   conditions, whereas they were partially removed in methanogenic
   conditions. A little methanogenic activity, established in acidogenic
   conditions because of the partial degradation of the chemical inhibitor,
   seems to be the key factor determining lipids degradation even in
   acidogenesis tests. Synthetic solutions were also tested. Oleic acid was
   degraded both in acidogenesis and methanogenesis tests, provided that an
   easily biodegradable substrate (glucose) was added to the solution. The
   presence of glucose was also required for the degradation of
   p-hydroxybenzoic acid in methanogenic conditions. This acid was not
   degraded at all in acidogenic conditions, thus confirming the results
   obtained in the tests on OME. Even if slightly lower, bioconversion
   yields of OME in acidogenesis are remarkably less sensitive to the
   effect of pH and substrate conditions than in methanogenesis. This
   result suggests that a two-phase anaerobic digestion might be adopted as
   a suitable process for optimizing OME degradation.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of rare earth elements (REE) in water samples using
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was evaluated with respect
   to selection of isotopes, detection limits, precision, matrix effects,
   and spectral interferences. The method was applied to raw and drinking
   water samples of 18 groundwater stations and two surface water stations,
   and to samples taken from the rivers Rhine and Meuse and from Lake
   IJsselmeer. Significant amounts of REE were found in the raw water
   samples of 8 locations and in the drinking water of 3 locations. Of the
   groundwater stations high concentrations of REE were only found for
   phreatic winnings of moderate depths having low carbonate contents. From
   general literature information indicative admissible drinking water
   concentrations were derived and compared with the found concentrations.
   For two of the three Locations mentioned the indicative admissible
   concentrations were exceeded for a number of REE elements and possible
   health risks for humans could not be excluded.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of temperature on the rate of volatile fatty acid (VFA)
   conversion by thermophilic methanogenic sludge, cultivated at 55 degrees
   C, was studied using both batch activity tests and continuous flow
   experiments. The temperature dependence of acetate conversion in the
   range between 37-70 degrees C could be described by an Arrhenius derived
   model when dispersed sludge with a low specific activity was used. For
   this sludge the optimum acetate conversion rate was found at 65 degrees
   C. However, the maximum acetate utilization rate was not affected by
   temperature in the range between 50 degrees C to 65 degrees C when
   granular sludge with a high specific methanogenic activity was used.
   Crushing the granules led to a 2 to 3 fold increase in the maximum
   activity at 60-65 degrees C, indicating that the conversion rate was
   very likely limited by the diffusion rate of acetate into the granules.
   Similar results were obtained with butyrate as the substrate. The
   temperature dependence of the crushed granules was similar to that of
   the less active dispersed sludge. In contrast, the thermophilic
   propionate oxidation rate was highest with the intact granular sludge
   while a similar temperature dependence was found for both the granular
   and dispersed sludges. The affinity for VFA increased with decreasing
   temperature. This phenomenon was most pronounced for the granular
   sludge. The thermophilic treatment of a VFA-mixture in a UASB reactor
   appeared to be only slightly affected by temperature when moderately low
   loading rates were applied, i.e. 20 kg COD . m(-3). d(-1). However,
   temperature had a strong effect applying loading rates of 40-90 kg COD .
   m(-3). d(-1) accompanied with high effluent VFA concentrations. The
   results reveal a high thermostability of the thermophilic wastewater
   treatment process in the range 45-60 degrees C if `'high-rate'' reactors
   with a granular sludge bed are used.}},

Abstract = {{Most homes and public facilities in the U.S. Virgin Islands use a roof
   catchment system to obtain drinking water. Because water is so scarce
   throughout the islands, every building (except those federally owned)
   are required to have a cistern. Rainwater is collected in the cisterns
   and is subject to contamination from enteric pathogens found in the
   environment. The objective of this study was to determine the occurrence
   and concentrations of human enteric protozoa in cisterns originating
   from animal fecal contamination. Volumes of 4001 of water were filtered
   from nine private and four public cisterns four times over a 1-year
   period for a total of 44 samples. After processing the Alter, the entire
   volume was examined using Cryptosporidium and Giardia specific
   antibodies and epifluorescence microscopy to determine levels of
   Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts. One or both of the protozoa
   were found in 81\% of the public cisterns and this was statistically
   significant (P = 0.005) when compared to the private cisterns where 47\%
   of the samples were positive. Cryptosporidium was found statistically
   more often in the 44 samples than Giardia. In addition, the use of a
   polyclonal antibody for Cryptosporidium which is genera-specific, also
   detected oocysts statistically more often than a monoclonal antibody
   which was more species-restrictive to C. parvum, which is associated
   with disease in humans, suggesting that non-mammalian oocysts were found
   more frequently in cistern waters. Levels ranged from 1 to 10
   organisms/1001 with one sample at 70 oocysts. These levels are
   associated with estimated daily risks of 10(-2) to 10(-4) and are well
   above acceptable guidance as described for safe drinking water in the
   United States. On occasion high levels of heterotrophic bacteria (9.9 x
   10(5) CFU/ml) and total coliforms (> 2000 CFU/100 ml) were also detected
   in these waters. A statistically significant correlation was found
   between the detection of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. (r =
   0.47853, P = 0.0008). The results of this study show that
   Cryptosporidium and Giardia, as well as bacteria, are present in these
   waters at levels which may involve significant public health risks.
   Public cistern systems are of particular concern because of the high
   percentage which were contaminated and the greater number of people
   exposed.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption-desorption capability of activated carbon was
   incorporated into biological denitrification process with the addition
   of external carbon source for nitrogen removal in water and wastewater
   treatment. Laboratory scale column packed with granular activated carbon
   (GAC) was fed with nitrate and sucrose in various modes. Other than
   continuous organic carbon addition (continuous mode), two different
   dynamic feeding modes, namely intermittent and injection modes were
   investigated. Under intermittent mode, organic carbon source was added
   in accordance with cycles consisting of two stages: an organic carbon
   feeding stage and an organic carbon starvation stage. Three cycle
   schedules in terms of duration of feeding stage and starvation period
   were examined. In injection mode, concentrated organic substrate was fed
   into the columns for 10 min at frequencies of 1, 2 or 3 times per day.
   With substrate C:N ratio of 1.88, influent NO3-N level of 20 mgl(-1) and
   empty bed contact time (EBCT) of 80 min, intermittent mode produced high
   overall N removal efficiencies ranging from 89 to 95\% which are
   comparable with levels attainable under continuous mode. Injection mode
   achieved slightly lower but reasonably high denitrification
   efficiencies. Under the conditions employed, once per day organic
   substrate injection was sufficient to remove 87\% of the influent NO3-N.
   The performance of anthracite media was also compared with GAC under
   both continuous and intermittent modes using identical set of
   conditions. Anthracite performed equally well under continuous mode
   where organic carbon source was always available. However, under
   intermittent mode, anthracite gave a poor N removal efficiency of 29\%
   during the starvation period due to the lack of adsorption and
   desorption capability in comparison with 90\% obtained in GAC media. The
   adsorption and desorption property of activated carbon was also applied
   in denitrification process for the treatment of water or wastewater with
   fluctuating influent NO3- concentration levels. Two cases of NO3-
   fluctuation were examined and in both cases, overall N removal
   efficiencies of more than 93\% were achieved.}},

Abstract = {{The removal of Cu, Ni and Zn-ions from water solution by ungranulated
   blast-furnace slag has been studied depending on contact time, initial
   ion concentration, pH and solution temperature. The polymineral
   composition and the slag specific properties determine its high sorption
   activity in metal salts solutions. In the range of the concentrations
   studied (10(-4)-10(-3) M), the sorption data for Cu2+ Ni2+ and Zn2+ have
   been described using Freundlich's parabolic equation. The material's own
   alkalizing activity creates conditions for effective metal ions sorption
   in a wide pH range. With the temperature increase the hydrolysis of the
   sorption matrix intensifies which leads to the sorption improvement, On
   the basis of both literature data and the author's own data the
   mechanism of metal ions removed by blast-furnace slag has been
   discussed.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{233-241}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{When the volumetric loading is greater than 50 kg-COD/m(3)-d, the
   performance of the tapered anaerobic fluidized-bed bioreactors is more
   efficient than that of the conventional anaerobic fluidized-bed
   bioreactor; however, the increasing percentages of the COD removal
   efficiency are not very significant when the taper angle is greater than
   5 degrees. The arithmetic means of the biofilm thickness, specific
   surface area and specific biomass of the former (increased with the
   increasing taper angle) are all larger than those of the latter; and the
   distribution of bioparticles in the former is more uniform than that in
   the latter. There is a fairly good agreement between the experimental
   and simulated removal efficiencies of the substrate, and thus, the
   proposed kinetic model can be used for the predicting purpose. The
   sensitivity analysis result together with the calculated values of
   Thiele modulus and the effectiveness factor reveal that the acetate
   methanogeness in the anaerobic fluidized-bed bioreactors is
   reaction-controlled, and the biofilm is fully penetrated by the
   substrate.}},
