Abstract = {{Heat was employed to coat crystalline goethite onto a quartz sand
   surface so that the adsorbent properties of the coating could be
   utilized. The adsorption characteristics of cadmium and humic acid onto
   goethite-coated sand were examined. Results show that the
   goethite-coated sand surface had a higher specific surface area and more
   mesopores than the uncoated sand. The adsorption of both cadmium and
   humic acid was highly pH-dependent: cadmium adsorption increased with
   pH, but humic acid adsorption decreased as pH increased. The presence of
   humic acid resulted in increasing cadmium adsorption in a specific pH
   range. The order of reacting humic acid with cadmium was found to have a
   noticeable effect on the final adsorption capacity. The adsorption
   capacity of cadmium for humic acid that is adsorbed onto goethite-coated
   sand before reacting with a cadmium system, exceeds that of humic acid
   that is mixed with cadmium ions before goethite-coated sand is added.

Abstract = {{Sprinkling infiltration in a forested esker leading to artificial
   recharge of groundwater was studied in Southern Finland. Changes in
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the molecular size distribution and
   chemical properties of the organic carbon were investigated during the
   infiltration process. Artificial groundwater was produced using
   sprinkling infiltration directly onto the forest floor. One result of
   lake water infiltration through the organic horizon and I m thick
   mineral soil layer was a slight net increase in the DOC concentrations
   from 9.4 mg/L in the infiltration water to 13.2 mg/L in percolation
   water. This indicates that the forest soil represents a potential input
   of organic matter into infiltration water. However, the DOC
   concentrations decreased by 27-38\% as the infiltration water percolated
   down through the unsaturated soil layer into the groundwater zone. At a
   distance of 1450 m from the infiltration area, the mean DOC
   concentration in the groundwater was below the recommended value for
   drinking water in Finland of 2.0 mg/L. There was a strong reduction in
   the concentrations of hydrophilic and hydrophobic acids, but only a
   slight decrease in hydrophilic neutral organic compounds during the
   infiltration process. The DOC in the production well consisted of low
   molecular size fractions. Larger molecular size fractions were removed
   effectively from the water during the infiltration process. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Somatic coliphages, F-specific RNA bacteriophages, bacteriophages
   infecting Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and enterococci were
   counted in bathing waters in the late spring and summer. We tested fresh
   and marine bathing waters from North, South, East and West Europe
   expected to contain between 100 and 500 E coli per 100 ml, although
   wider ranges were sometimes found. Bacteriophages were counted after
   concentration, since a preliminary study proved that this step was
   necessary to obtain positive counts. During monitoring, a first-line
   quality control with reference materials for bacteria and bacteriophages
   was performed by all the laboratories participating in the study. The
   same microbes were also counted in raw sewage samples from various areas
   in Europe, where the bacterial indicators and the three groups of
   bacteriophages were detected in roughly the same numbers. All groups of
   bacteriophages were detected in both fresh and marine bathing waters
   throughout Europe. Reliable and complete results from 147 samples showed
   that for log-transformed values, E. coli and bacteriophages were
   slightly correlated. However, the slope of the regression line changed
   according to E. coli concentration and the correlation diminished when
   this concentration was close to zero per 100 ml. The ratios between E
   coli and phages in bathing waters differed significantly from those in
   sewage. The relative amounts of bacteriophages, mainly somatic
   coliphages and phages infecting Bact. fragilis RYC2056, increased in
   bathing waters with low E coli concentration, especially in seawater
   samples containing < 100 E coli per 100 ml. The relationship of
   bacteriophages with respect to enterococci paralleled that of
   bacteriophages with respect to E coli. Somatic coliphages and
   bacteriophages infecting Bact. fragilis are useful to predict the
   presence of some pathogens with the same origin as present bacterial
   indicators but with higher survival rates. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{An urgent need exists for applicable methods to predict areas at risk of
   pesticide contamination within agricultural catchments. As such, an
   attempt was made to predict and validate contamination in nine separate
   sub-catchments of the Lourens River, South Africa, through use of a
   geographic information system (GIS)-based runoff model, which
   incorporates geographical catchment variables and physicochemical
   characteristics of applied pesticides. We compared the results of the
   prediction with measured contamination in water and suspended sediment
   samples collected during runoff conditions in tributaries discharging
   these sub-catchments. The most common insecticides applied and detected
   in the catchment over a 3-year sampling period were azinphos-methyl
   (AZP), chlorpyrifos (CPF) and endosulfan (END). AZP was predominantly
   found in water samples, while CPF and END were detected at higher levels
   in the suspended particle samples. We found positive (p < 0.002)
   correlations between the predicted average loss and the concentrations
   of the three insecticides both in water and suspended sediments (r
   between 0.87 and 0.94). Two sites in the sub-catchment were identified
   as posing the greatest risk to the Lourens River mainstream. It is
   assumed that lack of buffer strips, presence of erosion rills and high
   slopes are the main variables responsible for the high contamination at
   these sites. We conclude that this approach to predict runoff-related
   surface water contamination may serve as a powerful tool for risk
   assessment and management in South African orchard areas. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Microcosm studies were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   tetrabutoxysilane (TBOS) as a slow-release anaerobic substrate to
   promote reductive dehalogenation of trichloroethylene (TCE). The abiotic
   hydrolysis of TBOS and tetrakis(2-ethylbutoxy)silane (TKEBS), and the
   biotic transformations of the hydrolysis products from both were also
   investigated. Comparison of TCE reductive dehalogenation was performed
   with microbial communities stimulated from three different sites: Site
   300 Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), CA, Point Mugu Naval
   Weapons Facility, CA, and the Evanite site in Corvallis, OR. Poisoned
   microcosms showed that 1 mol of TBOS slowly and abiotically hydrolyzes
   to 4 mol of 1-butanol, while the live microcosms showed the 1-butanol
   ferments to butyrate and/or acetate, producing H-2. The hydrolysis of
   TBOS and TKEBS was abiotic and not enhanced by biotic processes under
   the anaerobic conditions of these tests. Hydrogen consumption was
   correlated with reductive dehalogenation, indicating it served as an
   electron donor for reductive dehalogenation. TBOS was found to be a
   slow-release anaerobic substrate to support long-term dechlorination of
   TCE to ethylene in Point Mugu microcosms, and in the LLNL microcosm
   bioaugmented with the Evanite culture. Electron mass balances showed
   most of the electron flow went into the creation of organic acids,
   especially acetate, and the production of methane. Electron efficiencies
   for reductive dechlorination were as high as 14\% based on the electrons
   used for, dechlorination to the total electrons associated with the mass
   of TBOS and TKEBS hydrolyzed. Rates of TBOS hydrolysis increased with
   greater TBOS concentrations as a light nonaqueous-phase liquids (LNAPL).
   These results indicate that TBOS has promise as an effective anaerobic
   substrate for remediating a wide range of CAH concentrations at
   different CAH contaminated sites. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography method for the
   determinaiion of the hydrophobicity of natural organic matter (NOM) was
   developed by modification of an existing method based on elution with
   acetic acid/acetonitrile. The modified method separates the NOM into two
   well-defined groups according to their retention on a C 18 column. The
   recovery was 101 +/- 11\% for samples containing between 4 and 40 mg/L
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The method Was tested for effects of
   ionic strength up to 0.8 eq. /L. Testing the method on eleven
   well-described NOM samples, at pH 4.7 and 7.0 revealed the strong pH
   dependency of the hydrophobicity. The effect of pH on the hydrophobicity
   could be predicted from the proton binding properties of the NOM.
   Application of the method to NOM samples fractionated by HPSEC
   demonstrated considerable variations in hydrophobicity among the
   fractions, particularly at low pH. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The zinc uptake and posterior release by an aquatic bryophyte-Fontinalis
   antipyretica L. Ex Hedw.-was experimentally studied in laboratory
   exposing the plants to different zinc concentrations in the range,
   1.0-5.0 mg l(-1), for a 144 It contamination period, and then exposed to
   metal-free water for a 120 h decontamination period. The experiments
   were carried out in perfectly mixed contactors at controlled
   illumination, using mosses picked out in February 1997, with a
   background initial zinc concentration of 263 mg g(-1) (dry wt.). A
   first-order mass transfer kinetic model was fitted to the experimental
   data to determine the uptake and release constants, k(1) and k(2), the
   zinc concentration in mosses at the end of the uptake period, C-mu, and
   at the equilibrium, for the contamination and decontamination stages,
   C-me and C-mr respectively. A bioconcentration factor, BCF = k(1)/k(2)
   (zinc concentration in the plant, dry wt./zinc concentration in the
   water) was determined. A biological elimination factor defined as BEF =
   1 - C-mr/C-mu was also calculated. BCF decreases from about 4500 to 2950
   as Zn concentration in water increases from 1.05 to 3.80 mg l(-1). BEF
   is approximately constant and equal to 0.80. Comparing Zn and Cu
   accumulation by Fontinalis antipyretica, it was concluded that the
   uptake rate for Zn (145 h(-1)) is much lower than for Cu (628 h(-1)) and
   the amount retained by the plant decreased by a factor of about seven.

Abstract = {{An environmental assessment is presented for the 25 most used
   pharmaceuticals in the National Health Service (NHS) in England in 2000.
   Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) for the aquatic
   environment were calculated using conservative assumptions and all PECs
   exceeded 1 ng l(-1). The calculation of predicted no-effect
   concentration (PNEC) based on aquatic toxicity data from the literature
   was possible for eleven of the pharmaceuticals. PNECs were predicted
   with ECOSAR for 12 of the remaining 14 but no data was available for two
   of the compounds. The PEC/PNEC ratio exceeded one for Paracetamol,
   Amoxycillin, Oxytetracycline and Mefenamic acid. Comparisons of the
   predicted concentrations of the compounds in sewage sludge based on
   either calculated sludge-water coefficients (K-d), octanol water
   coefficients (K-ow), acid base constants (pKa) or environmental
   modelling revealed large variations. No toxicity data was available for
   the terrestrial environment and no assessment was made. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Baseline levels of cadmium and lead were determined in muscle tissue and
   liver of hake (Merluccius merluccius) and red mullet (Mullus barbatus),
   two commercially important fish species from the eastern Adriatic.
   Concentrations of trace metals in liver (Cd: 6-183 mug kg(-1) w. wt.;
   Pb: 39-970 mug kg(-1) w. wt.) were within the range of recently
   published data for the Mediterranean. In the muscle tissue, cadmium
   concentrations (4.1-29 mug kg(-1) w. wt.) were among the lowest reported
   values for the Mediterranean, whereas lead levels (49-158 mug kg(-1) w.
   wt.) were within the range of values reported for various coastal areas
   of the Mediterranean. Presented data on cadmium and lead content in the
   studied fish species provide no proof of the general pollution of the
   Adriatic. Obtained data were tested in relation to fish length. Metal
   concentrations in liver decreased with the increase in fish size,
   whereas no significant correlation was found between trace metal levels
   in the muscle tissue and the length of both species. Relationships
   between metal concentrations and sex were also tested, but they gave no
   significant results. A comparison of contaminant concentrations in the
   edible tissue of hake and red mullet with the Croatian legislation shows
   that the consumption of their meat is not harmful for humans, not even
   for the most endangered population from the coastal region. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Sorption kinetics of heavy oil into porous carbons was evaluated by a
   concept of liquid sorption coefficient obtained from the weight increase
   of heavy oil with sorption time, which was measured by a wicking test.
   Exfoliated graphite, carbonized fir fibers and carbon fiber felts were
   used as porous materials. It was found that the liquid sorption
   coefficient of fibrous carbons was twice larger than that of exfoliated
   graphite. Such a difference in the liquid sorption coefficient between
   the exfoliated graphite and two fibrous carbons was caused by a
   difference in effective sorption porosity and tortuosity between them.
   For the exfoliated graphite and carbonized fir fibers, the liquid
   sorption coefficient and the effective sorption porosity were strongly
   dependent on their density. The maximum values of both liquid sorption
   coefficient and effective sorption porosity of the exfoliated graphite
   were shown at the bulk density around 16 kg/m(3). The liquid sorption
   coefficient of the carbonized fir fibers increased with increasing the
   density in the range from 6 to 30 kg/m(3). When the carbonized fir
   fibers were densified above 30 kg/m(3), the sorption rate was saturated.
   On the other hand, the sorption kinetics into the carbon fiber felt was
   almost independent of the bulk density, because the density of the
   carbon fiber felt is not effective for the pore structure. The effect of
   bulk density on the sorption kinetics could be supported from an
   analysis of pore structure of the porous carbons with different
   densities, which was measured by mercury porosimeter. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{. In this study, we tested a simple and rapid method for the estimation
   of carbon in the hydrophobic fraction of dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   of different origin (spruce, pine, and beech litter) in soil water. The
   method is based on the fact that the hydrophobic fraction of DOM
   contains almost entirely the aromatic moieties of DOM. Thus, it showed a
   clearly distinct light absorption at 260 nm compared to the hydrophilic
   fraction. This light absorption was directly proportional to the
   concentration of the hydrophobic fraction. Moreover, it was independent
   of the concentration of the hydrophilic fraction. We compared the
   concentrations of hydrophobic DOM estimated by the UV method with those
   of the conventional fractionation using chromatographic columns of XAD-8
   macroporous resin and found an excellent agreement between the two
   methods for both solutions from laboratory sorption experiments and
   field samples of forest floor leachates and subsoil porewaters. In
   addition, the absorption at 260 nm of hydrophobic DOM proved to be
   independent of pH values ranging from 2.0 to 6.5. Compared to the
   conventional chromatographic fractionation, the method using the UV
   absorption at 260 nm is less time consuming, needs a much smaller sample
   volume, and showed a better reproducibility. However, its use is
   restricted to water samples of low nitrate (< 25 mg L-1) and Fe (< 5 mg
   L-1) concentrations and, probably, with the hydrophobic fraction
   dominated by aromatic compounds deriving from degradation of lignin. (C)

Abstract = {{Users and providers of recycled water in Queensland, Australia, were
   canvassed to ascertain concerns about recycled water quality and
   directions for applied research. Some 79\% of respondents had concerns
   about recycled water quality including microbiological components, such
   as viruses, parasites and bacteria, salinity related components,
   aggregate components, such as pH and solids, nutrients, organic
   components, including pesticides and endocrine disruptors, as well as
   quality variability. Relative differences in the proportion of concern
   for some quality characteristics were observed between the areas of
   different population density with those from the low population areas
   being more concerned than those from medium or high areas. Some users
   and providers observed changes in recycled water quality during
   distribution including nutrients, chlorine, solids, colour and odour.
   Some 52\% of providers and 19\% of current users propose to expand their
   usage and 30\% of non-users propose to commence doing so in the next 5
   years. Recycled water quality characteristics identified for applied
   research included microbiological components, organic components,

Abstract = {{Ion exchange is an effective method for removing humic substances from
   drinking water supplies. We have explored a range of anion exchangers
   for removal of natural organic matter (NOM), both as isolated from
   surface waters and after fractionation into four fractions based on
   hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties. Resins of open structure and
   high water content are confirmed as the better performers, being very
   efficient at removal of any charged material, especially that of smaller
   molecular size. Quaternary ammonium resins. containing polar groups are
   especially effective. The presence of a neighbouring OH group close to
   the quaternary nitrogen, heteroatoms in the bridge between the exchange
   site and the polymer backbone, a secondary amino group as the exchange
   site, or a low ratio of carbon to quaternary nitrogen is beneficial. A
   suitable balance of polar and non-polar regions in the resin structure
   appears to be required. Weakly basic amino groups may have a greater
   affinity for hydrophilic counter ions than quaternary ammonium groups,
   but generally there are fewer charged sites in the resin at neutral pH.
   Nevertheless, weak base resins have NOM uptakes nearly as high as strong
   base resins of similar water content. Water content was found to be the
   most important parameter, though the effect was less pronounced for
   strong base resins. For weak base resins of low charge density a
   non-electrostatic mechanism involving hydrogen bonding of the
   undissociated acidic species in the NOM to the unprotonated amino groups
   on the resins is proposed. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published by

Abstract = {{The removal of natural organic matter (NOM) from drinking water supplies
   can be achieved by different processes, among them coagulation and
   adsorption. Synthetic waters made from concentrates of humic substances
   from reservoir and river waters were tested in the laboratory for ease
   of removal of NOM by coagulation with cationic organic polymers and with
   alum, and by adsorption on anion exchangers. For polymers such as high
   molecular weight polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (polyDADMAC) and
   cationic polyacrylamides of high charge, performance was nearly as
   effective as alum, with colour removals 86-100\% of those obtained for
   alum. Ion exchange using the best commercially available resins designed
   for this purpose, a gel polystyrene and a macroporous acrylic resin, was
   more effective than alum treatment for two of the natural waters
   studied, but inferior for a third. The resins were overall superior to
   cationic polymers.
   The NOM was separated into four fractions based on hydrophobic and
   hydrophilic properties. Alum was not as effective as ion exchange for
   the elimination of individual ionic NOM fractions. It was better than
   cationic polymers for removal of humic and fulvic acids, although
   polyDADMAC was as good for one water. For the removal of charged
   compounds alum then polyDADMAC were the best performers for that water.
   Unequivocal evidence was obtained that coagulants remove material that
   is not adsorbed by resins, and vice versa. A combination of coagulation
   with a cationic polymer and adsorption by an anion exchanger removed
   essentially all of the NOM. The preference of the coagulants was for the
   larger, more hydrophobic molecules, and of resins for smaller highly
   charged hydrophilic molecules. Each fraction had trihalomethane
   formation potentials in the range 11-24 mug/mg, except for one water
   that was more reactive. Hence, the actual amount of each fraction in the
   original water becomes a crucial factor. Crown Copyright (C) 2002

Abstract = {{In the bioreactor of the nitrification denitrification (ND)-activated
   sludge system, the mixed liquor is made up of organic and inorganic
   materials. In the current design procedures and simulation models, the
   influent wastewater characteristics and biological processes that
   influence the bioreactor mixed liquor organic solids (as volatile
   suspended solids, VSS, or COD) are explicitly included. However, the
   mixed liquor total suspended solids (TSS, i.e. organic + inorganic
   solids) are calculated simply from empirical ratios of VSS/TSS. The TSS
   concentration is fundamental in the design of secondary settling tanks
   and waste activated sludge disposal. Clearly, the empirical approach to
   obtaining an estimate for TSS is not satisfactory within the framework
   of a fundamentally based model. Accordingly, the incorporation of the
   inorganic material present in the influent wastewater into ND-activated
   sludge system mixed liquor was investigated. From an experimental
   investigation into the distribution of inorganics in the influent, mixed
   liquor and effluent of a laboratory-scale ND-activated sludge system, it
   was concluded inter alia that (i) of the total inorganic solids in the
   influent, only a small fraction (2.8-7.5\%) is incorporated into the
   mixed liquor, (ii) most of the inorganics in the influent (mean 88\%)
   and effluent (mean 98.5\%) are in the dissolved form, the balance being
   particulate, and (iii) the influent and effluent inorganic dissolved
   solids concentrations are closely equal (mean effluent to influent ratio
   100\%). Further, a number of models were developed to quantify the mixed
   liquor inorganic, and, hence, total solids. From an evaluation of these
   models against the experimental data, it would appear that the best
   approach to model the incorporation of inorganics into the activated
   sludge mixed liquor is to follow the concepts and principles used to
   develop the existing models for organic materials. With this approach,
   reasonably close correlation between predicted and measured data for
   mixed liquor and effluent inorganic concentrations were obtained. (C)

Abstract = {{We investigated Cu complexation by three dissolved organic matters
   (DOMs) collected by reverse osmosis (RO). Alkalimetric titration,
   pH-stat Cu and Ca titrations, pH edges of Cu-DOM complexation, and
   Ca/Mg-Cu exchange experiments were investigated at I = 10(-2) M for DOM
   samples of 10 mg C/L. The proton and Cu binding characteristics
   indicated similarity for all three DOMs. All Cu titrations employed ion
   selective electrode measurement and indicated the presence of relatively
   small amounts of strong Cu-binding sites. Four distinct classes of Cu
   binding sites are required for FITEQL 4.0 to provide good fits to the
   entire curves. The estimated total Cu binding site density is 4.55
   mmol/g C, much less than the total acidity but very close to the
   phenolic site content. Cu-DOM complexation increases approximately
   10-fold per pH unit, even at relatively high pH (> 8). We suggest that
   sites characterized as phenolic based on alkalimetric titration, not
   carboxyl sites, account for the majority of Cu complexation under
   natural water conditions, and Cu-DOM complexation is principally through
   the replacement of H+ by Cu2+ at the phenolic binding sites. The Cu-H
   exchange ratio is 1:1 for the first three sites and about 1:2 for the
   4th site. This 4-site model describes well the pH dependency of Cu-DOM
   complexation and provides good estimates of free Cu concentrations
   throughout wide total copper (Cu-T) and pH ranges. Comparison between
   Ca-DOM and Cu-DOM complexation demonstrated that (i) Ca-DOM complexation
   increases much less than an order of magnitude per pH unit and decreases
   at higher Ca concentration, different from that of Cu-DOM complexation;
   and (ii) Cu-DOM complexation is highly non-linear, in contrast to the
   much reduced extent of non-linearity of Ca-DOM complexation. Ca/Mg-Cu
   exchange experiments showed small competition effect, less than expected
   by a simple competition model, and the competition tended to reduce with
   increasing Ca or Mg concentrations. The extent of the competition by Mg
   and Ca are essentially comparable. Put all together, it suggests that Ca
   and Mg are preferably bound by carboxyl sites, especially at relatively
   high concentrations, resulting in a weakened apparent competition
   effect. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic model that links biokinetics and consumer-resource dynamics
   for describing zinc (Zn) accumulation in abalone Haliotis diversicolor
   supertexta has been developed and then applied to Zn data from real
   abalone farms. The biokinetic parameters used in this study, uptake and
   depuration rate constants of abalone and their food source, red alga
   Gracilaria tenuistipitata var. liui, were obtained from a laboratory
   14-d exposure experiment. We carried out a sensitivity analysis of the
   model by using the fractional factorial design technique, taking into
   account the influence of consumer-resource-related parameters such as
   growth and death rates and biomass and biokinetic parameters
   characterized by bioconcentration factor. Results indicate that the
   response time of biomagnification dynamics of Zn accumulation in abalone
   was influenced mainly by the growth rate of algae and biomass and the
   death rate of abalone and by interactions algae biomass and abalone
   death rate and abalone and algae biomass. New algae production results
   in substantially higher values of biomagnification factor. The linked
   model was then applied to field observations from a real-life situation
   of variable Zn concentrations occurring in abalone farms. Simulation
   results show that the predicted values are within a factor of 2 of the
   measured values (\% errors range from 5.3 +/- 4\% to 44.1 +/- 8 \%).
   Both model analysis and model application to the abalone farms suggest
   that the linking influences between biokinetics and consumer-resource
   dynamics support Zn accumulation in H. diversicolor supertexta and in G.
   tenuistipitata var. liui as functions of Zn concentration in water and
   abundance of food occurring in abalone farms. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Anodic Fenton treatment (AFT), an hydroxyl radical oxidation process
   recently developed for the degradation of aqueous pesticide waste, was
   applied to the degradation of atrazine, seven degradation products, and
   a formulated atrazine product. Using AFT, degradation of the parent
   compound occurred in 3 min. The concentration profiles of seven
   degradation products formed during treatment were measured, and
   degradation pathways are proposed for the treatment. The primary
   termination product after 10 min was dechlorinated ammeline. Three
   different C-14 labeled atrazine compounds (ethyl, isopropyl and
   U-triazine ring labeled atrazine) were also treated in an air-tight AFT
   apparatus and the mass balance was calculated. The triazine ring was not
   cleaved during this treatment process. Formulated atrazine was 70\%
   degraded in 3 min. AFT holds promise as an effective pesticide-laden
   water treatment technology. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   in groundwaters of Vojvodina Province. A study was conducted during
   April 2001. Some 110 samples of groundwater were taken from near surface
   aquifers. The water samples were first passed through a disk containing
   solid matrix coated with a chemically bonded C-18 organic phase. The
   disk was then eluted with supercritical carbon dioxide to remove
   compounds from the sorbent. Finally the extract was injected into
   capillary gas chromatograph. Average concentrations were 0.198 mug L-1
   for atrazine, 0.116 mug L-1 for DEA, 0.043 mug L-1 for DIA and 0.077 mug
   L-1 for DEIA. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine the frequency and densities
   of yeasts and filamentous fungi in coastal water samples as well as
   their correlation with the indicator bacteria of faecal pollution. The
   prevalence of fungi was investigated in parallel with the standard
   pollution indicator microorganisms in 197 marine water samples from six
   northern Greek prefectures during the bathing season May-October 1999.
   Filamentous fungi were isolated from all the examined samples and yeasts
   from 29 (14.7\%) of them; among the positive samples, their mean counts
   were 90.9 and 38.4 cfu/100 ml, respectively. A total of 23 genera of
   filamentous fungi and four genera of yeasts were identified. Prevailing
   genera of filamentous fungi were Penicillium, Aspergillus and Alternaria
   spp., whereas Candida spp. was the most frequently isolated yeast.
   Counts of yeasts were significantly (p<0.01) correlated with those of
   total and faecal coliforms, whereas no correlation was found between
   filamentous fungi and the indicator bacteria of faecal pollution.
   Significantly higher counts of total and faecal coliforms (p<0.05), and
   enterococci (p<0.001), were found during the months with the higher
   water temperatures and bather numbers. In the six prefectures,
   significant differences were observed in the counts of filamentous fungi
   and yeasts as well as in the counts of all the faecal pollution
   indicators. The results of this study indicate that coastal water can be
   a path for contamination of swimmers with yeasts and filamentous fungi
   and that the pollution indicator microorganisms cannot always predict
   their presence. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Activated carbon adsorption with attached microorganisms (biosorption)
   has been studied. The approaches. available do not account for an
   efficient role of activated carbon under a steady state of purification,
   considering it (carbon) as a carrier of biofilm only. This paper
   considers the role of physico-chemical, factors in order to clear up and
   assess a contribution of both physical adsorption and biodegradation
   (influencing effectiveness of the biosorption process) into the
   cumulative effect of the biosorption. The nonionic and anionic
   surfactants as well as phenol were used as sorbates. The impact of such
   essential physico-chemical factors of the adsorption process as the
   change in the Gibbs free energy (-DeltaG(a)(0)) and the porous structure
   of the activated carbon on the effectiveness of the biosorption process
   has been established. The lower the contribution of the biological
   degradation into the biosorption process, the higher the -DeltaG(a)(0).
   a result of the biodegradation process, products differing in their
   -DeltaG(a)(0) are generated on the active carbon. Separation of the
   biodegradation products characterized by different -DeltaG(a)(0) in the
   biosorption column filled by active carbon results in redistribution of
   contributions of physical adsorption and biodegradation into a
   cumulative effect. The micropores of the active carbon in the course of
   the biosorption/bioregeneration process are occupied by adsorbed
   molecules and are not subjected to biological regeneration. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The modification of polymeric materials (polystyrene and polyHIPE) by
   coating their surface with appropriate adsorbing agents (i.e. iron
   hydroxides) was investigated in the present work, in order to apply the
   modified media in the removal of inorganic arsenic anions from
   contaminated water sources. The method, termed adsorptive filtration,
   has been classified as an emerging technology in water treatment
   processes as it presents several advantages towards conventional
   technologies: the production of high amounts of toxic sludge can be
   avoided and it is considered as economically more efficient; whereas it
   has not yet been applied in full-scale treatment plants for low-level
   arsenic removal. The present experiments showed that both modified media
   were capable in removing arsenic from the aqueous stream, leading to
   residual concentration of this toxic metalloid element below 10 mug/L,
   which is the new maximum concentration limit set recently by the
   European Commission and imposed by the USEPA. Though, among the examined
   materials, polyHIPE was found to be more effective in the removal of
   arsenic, as far as it concerns the maximum sorptive capacity before the
   filtration bed reaches the respective breakthrough point. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{There have been reported outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease at hospitals
   and industrial facilities, which prompted the development of various
   preventive measures. For example, Ford has been developing and
   implementing such a measure at its facilities worldwide to provide
   technical guidance for controlling Legionella in water systems. One of
   the key issues for implementing the measure is the selection of a
   disinfectant(s) and optimum conditions for its use. Therefore, available
   publications on various disinfectants and disinfection processes used
   for the inactivation of Legionella bacteria were reviewed.
   Two disinfection methods were reviewed: chemical and thermal. For
   chemical methods, disinfectants used were metal ions (copper and
   silver), oxidizing agents (halogen containing compounds {[}chlorine,
   bromine, iodine, chlorine dioxide, chloramines, and halogenated
   hydantoins], ozone, and hydrogen peroxide), non-oxidizing agents
   (heterocyclic ketones, guanidines, thiocarbamates, aldehydes, amines,
   thiocyanates, organo-tin compounds, halogenated amides, and halogenated
   glycols), and UV light. In general, oxidizing disinfectants were found
   to be more effective than non-oxidizing ones.
   Among oxidizing agents, chlorine is known to be effective and widely
   used.
   Among non-oxidizing agents, 2,2-dibromo-3-nitropropionamide appears to
   be the most effective followed by glutaraldehyde. Isothiazolin (known as
   Kathon), polyhexamethylene biguanide, and 2-bromo-2-nitropropionamide
   (known as Bronopol) were found to be less effective than glutaraldehyde.
   Thermal disinfection is effective at > 60degreesC (140degreesF). (C)

Abstract = {{Lignin peroxidase production by a white rot fungus, Phanerochaete
   chrysosporium, was experimentally investigated using a batch system and
   a reactor system with various carriers. Immobilization of mycelia cell
   culture was more effective in promoting cell growth and lignin
   peroxidase production compared to conventional stationary liquid
   culture. Biostage carrier, commonly used for biochemical treatment in a
   fluidized bed disposal system, greatly improved production of lignin
   peroxidase up to 8.1 U/mL in the batch system. The packed bed reactor
   system was operated using a repeated batch technique, consisting of
   alternating growth and production phases, to sustain lignin peroxidase
   growth and production during the entire experiment period. Steady-state
   continuous PCP degradation over an extended period was accomplished with
   a mineralization ratio exceeding 80\%. These systems and operation
   methods are promising techniques for the treatment of hazardous waste.

   apolar, bioaccumulative, compounds by using the complementary
   semi-permeable membrane device technique. Real-life samples were taken
   at four locations in the main Dutch river systems and one in an
   agricultural area. Some 150 compounds were detected in the low-ng/l to
   low-mug/l range. Next to the target compounds, several brominated and
   chlorinated non-target compounds were detected by means of GC with
   atomic emission detection and tentatively identified using mass spectral
   library searching. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrite inhibition of Acinetobacter sp. growing under aerobic conditions
   was studied. Specific growth rates under non-limiting concentrations of
   acetate and dissolved oxygen averaged 0.62 h(-1). Growth and phosphate
   uptake by Acinetobacter sp. were both inhibited by increasing nitrite
   concentrations. The median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of free
   nitrous acid (FNA) was 0.10 mg/L and the IC10 of FNA was 0.05 mg/L.
   Removing nitrite from cultures reversed the inhibitory effect.
   Comparison of the IC10 of FNA for Acinetobacter sp. to inhibitory
   concentrations for other wastewater heterotrophic bacteria suggests that
   Acinetobacter sp. are relatively sensitive to this compound. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{In this study, the bacterial growth dynamics of a drinking water
   distribution system at low nutrient conditions was studied in order to
   determine bacterial growth rates by a range of methods, and to compare
   growth rates in the bulk water phase and the biofilm. A model
   distribution system was used to quantify the effect of retention times
   at hydraulic conditions similar to those in drinking water distribution
   networks. Water and pipe wall samples were taken and examined during the
   experiment. The pipes had been exposed to drinking water at
   approximately 13degreesC, for at least 385 days to allow the formation
   of a mature quasi-stationary biofilm. At retention times of 12 h, total
   bacterial counts increased equivalent to a net bacterial growth rate of
   0.048 day(-1). The bulk water phase bacteria exhibited a higher activity
   than the biofilm bacteria in terms of culturability, cell-specific ATP
   content, and cell-specific leucine incorporation rate. Bacteria in the
   bulk water phase incubated without the presence of biofilm exhibited a
   bacterial growth rate of 0.30 day(-1). The biofilm was radioactively
   labelled by the addition of C-14-benzoic acid. Subsequently, a biofilm
   detachment rate of 0.013 day(-1) was determined by measuring the release
   of C-14-labelled bacteria of the biofilm. For the quasi-stationary phase
   biofilm, the detachment rate was equivalent to the net growth rate. The
   growth rates determined in this study by different independent
   experimental approaches were comparable and within the range of values
   reported in the literature. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The role of organic acids in buffering pH in surface waters has been
   studied using a small brownwater stream (26 mg L(-1) TOC) draining a
   forested catchment in Northern Sweden. Under the conditions of elevated
   pressure of CO(2) stream field pH was changed between 3.5 and 6.1 during
   the acidification and alkalinization experiment. Acid-base
   characteristics of the natural organic matter were also determined using
   a high precision potentiometric method for a concentrated sample from
   the same stream. We compared the predictions from the Windermere Humic
   Aqueous Model (WHAM Model), a model derived from the potentiometric
   titration (diprotic/monoprotic acid model) and a previously derived
   triprotic acid model which only uses alkalinity and TOC as input
   variables. The predicted buffering characteristics of all three models
   are very similar in the pH range 4.5-7 which suggests that during
   routine analysis alkalinity and TOC are sufficient to give a good
   estimate of organic acid anion charge contribution in a large range of
   surface waters. A slightly adjusted version of WHAM V successfully
   describes the organic charge contribution in a large number of sampled
   surface water lakes, which were previously used to calibrate the
   triprotic model. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A study was conducted at Lake Jamsanvesi in Central Finland, to identify
   the potential ecotoxicological risks of the remediation operation of a
   creosote-/PAH-contaminated lake sediment, made by capping during the
   years 1998-1999. Mussels (Anodonta anatina) were deployed to the lake at
   the same time as the remediation operation was started in November 1998.
   The contaminated area (0.5 ha) was covered by a filter geotextile
   (polypropylene), gravel and sand (1-1.5 m) which were spread out on the
   ice and let to sink onto the bottom of the lake when the ice melted in
   May 1999. The possible impacts of capping to the adjacent environment
   were assessed from mussels exposed and particulate material settled
   (SPM) to collectors placed on the lake bottom. Mussel tissue, SPM, the
   water inside the collector were analyzed for polycyclic aromatic
   compounds (PAH)-compounds. Biological endpoints included body condition,
   glycogen and protein contents of adductor muscle. Mussels and SPM
   exposed downstream to the contaminated site (Site 3) contained the
   highest total PAH concentrations. Biota-sediment accumulation factors of
   acenaphthene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene and
   benzo(a)anthracene of mussels varied from 0.79 to 1.45. The glycogen and
   protein concentrations were lowest in adductor muscle from mussels
   exposed to conditions at Site 3. Concentrations of some PAH-compounds
   were found distinctly increased adjacent to the remediated area,
   possibly due to the agitation of contaminated sediment due to the
   capping. It is also possible that resuspension of sediment around
   remediated area (containing some PAHs) spread the deposited
   PAH-compounds. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A chemical sensor array (consisting of 8 conducting polymers) was used
   to continuously monitor for the presence or absence of industrial
   pollutants in the headspace of wastewater generated from an on-line
   flow-cell. A domestic wastewater (Cranfield University sewage works) was
   dosed with diesel to stimulate the presence of an intermittent discharge
   in a wastewater influent. Response patterns between the sensors were
   used to detect for the presence of organic compounds in the wastewater.
   Correlations between the sensor response patterns or fingerprints were
   also analysed using principal component analysis. The results clearly
   demonstrate that a chemical sensor array can rapidly identify the
   presence of organic compounds (such as diesel) in a wastewater matrix
   and could be further developed to monitor for industrial pollutants at

Abstract = {{This research investigated the effects of electrolytic stimulation on
   the performance of two laboratory-scale septic tanks. The tanks were fed
   a synthetic solution that included cellulose, peptone trypticase, beef
   extract, and urea. After a baseline period with no passed current,
   currents ranging from 100 to 500 mA were passed through the electrodes.
   The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency from the tanks
   improved when a current was passed, with higher removal efficiencies
   observed at higher levels of passed current. Hydrolytic reactions
   resulted in ammonia and phosphate levels in the tanks that were higher
   than the influent. At currents > 300 mA, these hydrolytic reactions were
   suppressed, resulting in phosphate levels similar to the influent and
   ammonia levels lower than the influent because of the settling of
   ammonia-containing components of the feed solution. A slight increase in
   nitrate levels was observed when a current was passed, indicating
   minimal stimulation of nitrification activity. Abiotic studies confirmed
   that the COD can be removed via electrolysis and the removal was
   proportional to the passed current. Under the conditions of this study,
   the primary benefit of electrolytic stimulation of the septic tank is
   enhanced COD removal. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In Bautzen Reservoir (Germany), a technique of internally dosing iron
   compounds in combination with a local water column destratification was
   developed in order to control Microcystis blooms. In this paper,
   experimental results concerning the phosphorus (P) precipitation by iron
   application are reported. First, preliminary studies were conducted
   serving the choice of an appropriate precipitant. Subsequently, a
   whole-lake experiment was carried out. Fe2+ salts displayed a delayed
   oxidation and flocculation behaviour when injected into an ascending
   water jet. Nevertheless, the efficiency of soluble reactive phosphorus
   (SRP) elimination was equal to experiments with Fe3+ compounds both in
   laboratory and field experiments. During Fe2+ application, a large
   P-binding potential remained during the horizontal spreading of the
   treated water, since the proportion of the dissolved iron fraction near
   the dosage point was still high. Thus, measurements at a greater
   distance from the dosage point revealed higher amounts of P eliminated
   by Fe2+ than by Fe3+ dosage. Compared to the preceding year 1995, during
   the treatment periods in May-August 1996 and 1997 the SRP contents in
   the whole water body dropped by 72\% and 54\%, respectively, while the
   total phosphorus contents dropped by 45\% at each period. We conclude
   that in-lake dosage of Fe2+ is an appropriate method to reduce the P
   loading of hypereutrophic reservoirs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{MX was widely considered as one of the most important disinfection
   by-products (DPBs) and as the strong carcinogen in the chlorinated
   drinking water. Some model compounds which have been classified into
   four families were chlorinated at laboratory conditions. MX was produced
   only in the chlorinated substituted aromatic aldehydes and amino acids,
   while a possible new compound (COHC) was found in some substituted
   aromatic aldehydes, chlorinated substituted aromatic acids and phenols.
   Through the analysis of the peaks presented in mass spectrum, the
   composition and structure of the new compound are proposed as
   2-chloro-5-oxo-3-hexene diacyl chloride (COHC) which could cause
   interference in the detection of MX. COHC has also been found in
   drinking water and extracted chlorinated fulvic acid solution from the
   sediment and water of Tai Lake, so it should bring about more attention.

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{4543-4551}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Microbial biomass development in the sand and schmutzdecke layer was
   determined in two full-scale slow sand filters, operated with and
   without a light excluding cover. A standard chloroform
   fumigation-extraction technique was adapted to routinely measure
   microbial biomass concentrations in the sand beds. Sand was sampled to a
   depth of 10 cm and schmutzdecke was also collected at the same random
   positions on the uncovered filter. Interstitial microbial biomass in the
   uncovered sand bed increased with time and decreased with sampling
   depth. There was a small accumulation of sand biomass with time in the
   covered filter, but no relationship was apparent between biomass
   concentration and depth in this filter. Schmutzdecke did not develop on
   the covered filter and was spatially highly variable in the uncovered
   condition compared to the consistent patterns observed in interstitial
   biomass production. It is speculated that microbial biomass in the sand
   of uncovered filters is largely related to carbon inputs from
   photosynthetic activity in the schmutzdecke and involves mechanisms that
   spatially distribute carbon substrate from the schmutzdecke to the sand.
   However, total organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon removals were
   similar in both filters suggesting that relatively small biomass
   populations in covered filters are sufficient to remove residual labile
   carbon during advanced water treatment and little further advantage to
   water purification and organic carbon removal is gained by the increased
   production of biomass in uncovered slow sand filter beds. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Aquatic humic solutes were separated by the non-ionic macroporous XAD-8

   seven different fresh water sources. Synchronous fluorescence
   spectroscopy was applied for characterization, differentiation and

   properties verified that humic-solute fractions isolated parallelly with
   the non-ionic XAD-8 and DAX-8 resins resembled very closely each other
   speaking strongly for their structural similarities. DAX-8 resin
   separated ca. 19\% more aquatic humic matter than did the analogous
   XAD-8 resin. It was possible to tentatively differentiate the untreated
   water samples according to their fluorescent materials. Several distinct
   classes of chromophores were detected in both DOM and isolated humic
   fractions by the synchronous technique: lambda(ex)/lambda(em) 280/298,

Abstract = {{The trophic transfer of metals along the food chain has been recognized
   as an important issue in the study of water quality in recent years.
   Feeding experiments were conducted to examine the assimilation of three
   metals (Cd, Cr and Zn) by the zebrafish Danio reiro feeding on the
   freshwater zooplankton Daphnia magna. The zooplankton were exposed to
   radiotracers from both the aqueous and dietary phases for different
   duration, and then pulse-fed to the zebrafish for measurements of metal
   assimilation efficiency (AE). The calculated AEs were 3-8\% for Cd,
   2-39\% for Cr, and 17-36\% for Zn in the zebrafish. For Cd and Zn, there
   was no statistically significant difference between the two different
   radiolabeling routes (aqueous and dietary exposure). For Cr, the AEs
   were higher when it was accumulated by D. magna from the dietary source
   than when it was accumulated from the aqueous phase. The gut passage
   time (GPT) was 6-10 h for all metals, with less variation for Zn among
   the different treatments. There was no obvious relationship between
   metal GPT and metal AE, presumably due to the narrow range of variation
   of metal gut passage. About 5-36\%, 20-31\%, and 8-30\% of the total Cd,
   Cr and Zn was found in the soft tissue of D. magna after the
   radiolabeling. A much higher fraction of Cd and Zn was found in the soft
   tissue of D. magna when the metals were accumulated from the dietary
   phase. No significant relationship between the metal AE and the metal
   distribution in the soft tissue of D. magna was however documented in
   this study. Our results demonstrated that there was major difference in
   metal AE in freshwater fish among different metals. Metal localization
   in prey organisms and GPT appear to have little influence on metal
   assimilation by the zebrafish. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The dispersion coefficient (D) is a very important parameter for the
   management of water quality and pollution control. Conventional sampling
   methods are based on tracer studies. Sampling periods and intervals are
   often subjective and left to the choice of the experimenter. Sometimes
   several observations are made to determine D. Yet, making several
   observations does not necessarily ensure accurate estimation of the
   parameters. Sampling of tracer concentrations at poor times will result
   in inaccurate estimates of D and the flow velocity (u). Therefore, the
   main aim of the study in question was to investigate the optimal
   sampling times for conducting fixed position variable-time sampling for
   tracer concentration experiments. This objective was achieved by the
   minimization of the least square criterion and applying the method
   proposed by Box and Lucas. The relative efficiency of each experimental
   design is predicted before data collection and analysis and confidence
   regions plotted. Results, on optimal sampling times for experiments are
   presented and illustrated. The application of these findings will
   harmonize results and reduce cost and labour expended on dispersion
   experiments. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A fluorescence-quenching method is developed to assess the effect of pH
   on the coagulation mechanism of humic acids (HA) reacting with metal,
   ions. A polyferric sulfate (PFS) synthesized in our laboratory is
   adopted as the coagulant to simplify the hydrolysis process and increase
   the experimental precision. The following results are discovered. When
   the concentration of PFS increases from 2 to 10 mg/L, the effective pH
   range of HA removal changes from 4.0-5.0 to 4.0-7.5. At increased
   coagulation pH, the ferric ions may still react with HA but unable to
   neutralize the surface charge completely. The residual concentrations of
   HA measured by fluorescence spectrophotometer are lower than those by
   TOC, as a consequence of the fluorescence-quenching effect. This
   demonstrates that the coagulation of HA by PFS at low pH is mainly due
   to charge-neutralization. The adsorption of the HA on the pre-formed
   iron hydroxide flocs is accompanied by the dissociation of Fe ions from
   the floc structure until the equilibrium has been reached, which is
   evidenced by the presence of the Fe-HA complexes in the solution during
   adsorption experiment. This is quite different from the characteristics
   of flocs formed by PFS associated with HA in the coagulation. Within the
   pH range investigated, the complex-formation and the hydrolysis are the
   two competitive reactions happened between the hydroxide ions in
   solution and the functional groups of HA. Therefore, the removal of HA
   is not caused by adsorbing onto the iron hydroxide resulted from PFS
   hydrolysis, but through the complex-formation between the PFS and the
   HA. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of aqueous phase Ca(II) concentrations and pH levels on the
   adsorption capacity of dissolved organic matters (DOMs) as well as the
   capacity dependency on the sources and types of DOMs and activated
   carbons (ACs) were examined. The Ca(II) effect was studied for three
   coal-based ACs having different pore size distributions (PSDs) and for
   three DOMs contained in three water samples. For each water sample, four
   working solutions prepared by adding different dosages of Ca(II) (0-1.5
   mM) were used. For the water sample whose adsorption capacity was least
   affected by Ca(II), the effect of pH was subsequently examined for four
   water pH levels (pH = 5.5-10) and these three ACs. Isotherm data were
   analyzed in terms of a modified isotherm model selected from three
   models developed for normalizing isotherms of heterogeneous organic
   mixtures. The Ca(II) effect depended obviously on the DOMs used. For all
   three ACs, increasing Ca(II) greatly enhanced the adsorption capacity of
   a commercial humic acid. However, the capacity of the DOM in a naturally
   colored surface water source was much less affected and that of the DOM
   remaining after precoagulation was not affected. The DOM-Ca(II)
   interactions, rather than the AC-Ca(II) interactions, seemed to be the
   predominant mechanism that controlled the extent of the Ca(II)'s impact.
   Water pH greatly affected the adsorption of the surface water DOM
   remaining after precoagulation. This effect seemed to be attributed to
   pH's capability in changing ACs' charge characteristics reflected by
   zeta-potentials. The adsorption capacity increased as the water pH
   decreased and was well correlated as a function of pH and the volume of
   AC pores in sizes of 30-100 Angstrom. ACs having more pores in this size
   region generally exhibited larger adsorption capacities. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Water flow rate, gas-phase holdup, and dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles
   are measured in a full-scale airlift aerator as a function of applied
   air flow rate. A model that predicts oxygen transfer based on
   discrete-bubble principles is applied. The riser DO profiles are used to
   calculate the initial bubble size. The range of calculated bubble
   diameters obtained using the model is 2.3-3.1 mm. The Sauter-mean
   diameter of bubbles measured in the laboratory ranged from 2.7 to 3.9
   mm. The riser and downcomer DO profiles and gas holdups predicted by the
   model are in close agreement with the experimental results. A model that
   predicts water flow rate based on an energy balance is used to calculate
   K-t, the frictional loss coefficient for the air-water separator.
   Excluding the data at the very lowest air now rate, the range of
   calculated values for K-t (3-8) is close to a literature value of 5.5
   proposed for hydrodynamically similar external airlift bioreactors. The
   models should prove useful in the design and optimization of airlift
   aerators. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The turnover of phosphorus and nitrogen have been studied in a low
   salinity estuary in the Bothnian Sea. The estuary, Gardsfjarden, has a
   high loading of nutrients from a pulp and paper mill which supplies the
   estuary with three times the annual natural input of phosphorus and
   nitrogen, respectively. The turnover of nutrients was to a great extent
   determined by hydrodynamic variations. During periods of intense
   resuspension there was a net export of particulate bound nutrients from
   the estuary to the sea but since these periods were short there was an
   overall net retention of particulate nutrients. The estuary was a source
   for dissolved phosphorus to the sea. The major source of phosphorus
   export was release of dissolved P from anoxic sediments. Gardsfjarden
   was a sink for dissolved nitrogen which most likely escaped the estuary
   by denitrification. Nitrate was supplied by degradation of particulate
   organic nitrogen but the main source was import from the sea. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{A discrete-bubble model that predicts the rate of oxygen transfer in
   diffused-bubble systems is evaluated. Key inputs are the applied gas
   flow rate and the initial bubble size distribution. The model accounts
   for changes in the volume of individual bubbles due to transfer of
   oxygen and nitrogen (and hence changing partial pressure), variation in
   hydrostatic pressure, and changes in temperature. The bubble-rise
   velocity and mass-transfer coefficient, both known functions of the
   bubble diameter, are continually adjusted. The model is applied to
   predict the results of diffused-bubble oxygen transfer tests conducted
   in a 14-m deep tank at three air flow rates. All of the test data are
   predicted to within 15\%. The range of bubble diameters (0.2-2 mm) spans
   the region of greatest variation in rise velocity and mass-transfer
   coefficient. For simplicity, the Sauter-mean diameter is used rather
   than the full bubble size distribution without loss of accuracy. The
   model should prove useful in the design and optimization of hypolimnetic
   oxygenation systems, as well as other diffused-bubble applications. (C)

Abstract = {{Phosphonates are used in large quantities in industry and household
   products as scale inhibitors and chelating agents. They are not
   biodegraded during wastewater treatment but are removed by adsorption
   processes. Field measurements from different wastewater treatment plants
   affirm that they are removed almost completely during wastewater
   treatment. Adsorption of nitrilotrismethylenephosphonic acid onto
   activated sludge, amorphous iron oxide and humic acids (HAs) was studied
   under controlled conditions. The adsorption onto HAs decreases sharply
   with increasing pH with negligible adsorption at pH above 6.5.
   Adsorption onto amorphous iron oxide follows a Langmuir behavior. The
   presence of 1 mM Ca doubles the maximum surface capacity at pH 7.
   Adsorption onto activated sludge is not very pH sensitive and is
   explained to a large extent by adsorption onto amorphous iron oxides,
   but the contribution of organic matter or other mineral phases cannot be
   ruled out. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in methanogenic population levels were followed during startup
   of a full-scale, farm-based anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR)
   and these changes were linked to operational and performance data. The
   ASBR was inoculated with anaerobic digester sludge from a municipal
   wastewater treatment facility. During an acclimation period of
   approximately 3 months, the ASBR content was diluted to maintain a total
   ammonia-N level of approximately 2000 mg l(-1). After this acclimation
   period, the volatile solids loading rate was increased to its design
   value of 1.7 g l(-1) day(-1) with a 15-day hydraulic retention time,
   which increased the total ammonia-N level in the ASBR to approximately
   3600 mg l(-1). The 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) levels of the
   acetate-utilizing methanogens of the genus Methanosarcina decreased from
   3.8\% to 1.2\% (expressed as a percentage of the total 16S rRNA levels)
   during this period, while the 16S rRNA levels of Methanosaeta concilii
   remained low (below 2.2\%). Methane production and reactor performance
   were not affected as the 16S rRNA levels of the hydrogen-utilizing
   methanogens of the order Methanomicrobiales increased from 2.3\% to
   7.0\%. Hence, it is likely that during operation with high ammonia
   levels, the major route of methane production is through a syntrophic
   relationship between acetate-oxidizing bacteria and hydrogen-utilizing
   methanogens. Anaerobic digestion at total ammonia-N levels exceeding
   3500 mg l(-1) was sustainable apparently due to the acclimation of
   hydrogen-utilizing methanogens to high ammonia levels. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{4655-4658}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The effects of sample storage on enumeration of Escherichia coli in
   marine bathing water and culturable bacteria in drinking water were
   evaluated. Results showed that overnight storage at 0-5degreesC
   significantly reduced the counts of E coli in bathing water (p = 0.0001)
   with a mean reduction of 25\%. A similar effect of sample storage was
   observed for the enumeration of culturable bacteria in drinking water at
   22 +/- 2degreesC for 66 +/- 4 h (p = 0.0074; mean reduction = 25\%) or
   at 36 +/- 2degreesC for 44 +/- 4 h (p = 0.0353; mean reduction = 6\%).
   The use of a delayed incubation method, i.e. overnight storage at
   0-5degreesC of inoculated agar plates prior to incubation, did not
   significantly affect the counts of culturable bacteria when plates were
   incubated at 22 +/- 2degreesC for 66 +/- 4 h, whereas it resulted in a
   significant increase of the bacterial numbers when plates were incubated
   at 36 +/- 2degreesC for 44 +/- 4 h (p = 0.0002; mean increase = 32\%).
   Based on these results, it is suggested to avoid the use of overnight or
   longer sample storage for the enumeration of E. coli in bathing water
   samples, as well as for the enumeration of culturable bacteria in
   drinking water. The delayed incubation method appears to be a reliable
   procedure for the enumeration of culturable bacteria and could represent
   a valid alternative to sample storage in order to overcome problems
   associated with the performance of bacteriological counts during
   weekends or statutory holidays. However, a multi-laboratory study is
   needed to evaluate the reproducibility of the delayed incubation method
   for the enumeration of culturable bacteria and its possible use for the
   enumeration of E. coli by membrane filtration. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The cyanobacterial hepatotoxic alkaloid cylindrospermopsin (CYL) is of
   increased concern to public health due to the spreading of its main
   producer, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, around the globe. Here we
   present results of an evaluation of the possibility to analyse
   environmental samples for their content of CYL based on HPLC with photo
   diode array detection as an alternative to costly LC-MS approaches. A
   gradient from 0\% to 50\% aqueous methanol (+ 0.05\% trifluoroacetic
   acid) in 20 min proved to be highly reproducible with respect to peak
   height, peak area, and retention time of purified CYL. Good linearity of
   peak area response was found for 1-300 ng CYL on column. For a good
   performance the duration of equilibration prior to individual runs was
   crucial. Extraction from cell material (culture and bloom) was
   efficiently done with pure water in one extraction step and CYL contents
   determined matched well with results previously obtained by LC-MS. When
   different seston matrices were added to cultured cells to mimic
   realistic environmental samples, however, peaks eluting close to CYL in
   chromatograms restrained the performance. The data presented show a
   limitation of HPLC-PDA analysis for trace amounts of CYL in
   environmental samples but also underline the potential of an inexpensive
   and fast analysis for various purposes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title = {{Modelling the start-up of a full-scale biological phosphorous and

Abstract = {{In this paper we simulated the start-up of a full-scale biological
   phosphorus and nitrogen removing (BPNR) wastewater treatment plant
   (wwtp). For the simulation we used a metabolic phosphorus model
   integrated in ASM2d, referred to as the Technical University Delft
   Phosphorus (TUDP) model. In a previous study it was shown that under
   steady state conditions the model is determined by stoichiometry rather
   than kinetics. To evaluate the kinetics of the metabolic biological
   phosphorus model, we recorded and simulated the start-up of a full-scale
   upgraded BPNR process. The initial state of the start-up was the
   simulated steady state of the process prior to the start-up. We could
   evaluate the SRT during the start-up on the basis of the accumulation of
   total-phosphorus in the sludge. During the start-up, the process changed
   from partly nitrifying to fully nitrifying, denitrifying and phosphate
   removing. Growth of PAO only showed sensitive for the glycogen formation
   rate k(GLY). Disregarding a 20\% in- or decrease of the kinetic rates of
   biological phosphorus removal (BPR), all start-up simulations converged
   to comparable steady states. This underlines that BPR is determined by
   stoichiometry rather than kinetics. Previous simulation studies with the
   TUDP-model showed that glycogen accumulated to unrealistic high
   concentrations with an increasing sludge retention time (SRT). We
   modelled the glycogen kinetics with a maximum glycogen fraction, which
   proved an effective and straightforward method to avoid unrealistic
   glycogen accumulation. In the steady state simulations, the glycogen
   concentration was determined by the value of the maximum glycogen
   fraction (f(GLY)(max)), whereas the overall sludge composition showed
   insensitive towards this parameter. Temperature appeared highly
   sensitive and therefore should not be neglected when modelling BPR. (C)

Abstract = {{Hydrogenotrophic denitrification of nitrate contaminated groundwater in
   a bench-scale microporous membrane bioreactor has been investigated. To
   prevent microbial contamination of the effluent from the reactor the
   nitrate-laden water treated was separated from the denitrifying culture
   with a 0.02 mum pore diameter membrane. Equal pressure was maintained
   across the membrane and nitrate was removed by molecular diffusion
   through the membrane and into the denitrifying culture. The system was
   operated with a hydrogenotrophic denitrification culture to circumvent
   the addition of an organic substrate to the water. Removal efficiencies
   ranging from 96\% to 92\% were achieved at influent concentrations
   ranging from 20 to 40mg/L NO3--N. The flux values achieved in this study
   were 2.7-5.3g NO3--Nm(-2) d(-1). The microporous membrane served as an
   effective barrier for preventing microbial contamination of the product
   water as evidenced by the effluent heterotrophic plate count of 9
   (+/-3.5) CFU/mL. The hydrogenotrophic culture was analyzed using
   available 16S and 23S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes. It was
   determined that the enrichment process selected for organisms belonging
   to the beta subclass of Proteobacteria. Further analysis of the
   hydrogenotrophic culture indicated that the organisms may belong to the
   beta-3 subgroup of Proteobacteria and have yet to be identified as
   hydrogenotrophic denitrifiers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The sonolytic degradation of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) has been
   investigated at ultrasonic frequency of 20 kHz. The observed
   pseudo-first-order rate constant decreased from 1.25 x10(-4) to 5.32 x
   10(-5) s(-1)as the concentration of MTBE increased from 2.84 x 10(-2) to
   2.84 x 10(-1) mM. The rate of degradation of MTBE increased with the
   increase of the power density of ultrasonicator and also with the rise
   in reactor system temperature. In the presence of oxidising agent,
   potassium persulphate, the sonolytic rate of degradation of MTBE was
   accelerated substantially. Tert-butyl formate (TBF) and acetone were
   found to be the major intermediates of the degradation of MTBE. It is
   found that the ultrasound/Fe2+ /H2O2 method is promising process for the
   degradation of MTBE. More than 95\% degradation of MTBE (2.84 x 10(-2)
   mM) along with its intermediate products has been achieved during the
   coupled ultrasound/Fe2+/ H2O2 method. Hence, the coupled
   ultrasound/Fe2+/H2O2 may be a viable method for the degradation MTBE
   within a short period of time than the ultrasound irradiation process
   only. A kinetic model, based on the initial rates of degradation of MTBE
   and TBF, provides a good agreement with the experimental results. (C)

Abstract = {{Sorption onto an easily regenerable sorbent in fixed bed filters would
   be an interesting option for removal of reactive dyes from textile
   wastewaters. A previous screening with model solutions (Dyes Pigm 51
   (2001)111) had shown two anion exchangers (strong basic S6328a and weak
   basic MP62, both Bayer) to exhibit good sorption characteristics for
   reactive dyes. The aim of this study was to evaluate these materials
   more closely. Thus filter breakthrough, the behavior with original
   wastewater samples, and the effect of inorganic wastewater parameters as
   well as regeneration were studied. Breakthrough curves for both
   materials are relatively unfavorable with a flat gradient, but
   throughput until breakthrough (100-800 bed volumes) should be sufficient
   for technical use. With both resins dye uptake is influenced little by
   competition of inorganic anions (sulfate, carbonate, phosphate) and they
   perform well in original wastewaters. However, the weak basic type is
   only efficient up to pH 8. Alkaline regeneration works well for MP62,
   for S6328a acid regeneration works for most dyes. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Olive mill wastewaters (OMW) present a major environmental problem. The
   large amounts generated, combined with the high phenols and chemical
   oxygen demand concentrations, are the main difficulties in finding a
   solution for the management of these wastewaters, which are dangerous
   for the environment. The phenols, which are contained in the OMW have a
   structure similar to lignin, which makes them difficult to biodegrade.
   Lignin can be degraded only by a few microorganisms, such as
   ``white-rot{''} basidiomycete, which produce manganese (MnPs) and lignin
   peroxidases (LiPs) and laccases that are responsible for the oxidisation
   of lignin compounds. The capability of Pleurotus ostreatus to degrade
   phenols of OMW in different conditions such as in sterilized and
   thermally processed (at 100degreesC) wastewater, with and without
   dilution, is investigated in this work. According to the experimental
   results P. ostreatus removed phenols from the culture medium, under all
   different conditions that were examined. The degradation of phenols
   reached up to 78.3\% for the sterilized and 50\% diluted OMW, 66.7\% and
   64.7\% for the thermally processed OMW, with and without dilution,
   respectively. The effect of pre-treatment of OMW on the performance of
   anaerobic digestion is also assessed, as methanogenic bacteria are
   seriously affected by the presence of phenol compounds. The pre-treated
   wastewater was shown to be more amenable to a subsequent anaerobic
   digestion. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three types of well-characterized chitosans of different composition
   were applied to flocculate 8 different bacterial species. The aim of
   this study was to relate chitosan structure and flocculation
   characteristic to general bacterial characteristics such as the cell
   surface charge and hydrophobicity. Large differences in the flocculation
   efficiency of chitosan were found between different bacterial
   suspensions, both regarding the effective chitosan concentrations and
   the optimal type of chitosan. However, no correlation was observed
   between general surface characteristics of bacteria and flocculation by
   chitosan of different composition. It may be concluded that purely
   electrostatic interactions did not play a dominant role in flocculation
   of Gram-negative bacteria in this study. The presence of GlcNAc residues
   had clearly beneficial effects on flocculation in such cases.(C) 2002

   taken from an abandoned mine in Pikeville, Kentucky. The concentrations
   of metals such as iron, may be reduced at pH 4.5 from 194 ppm to below

Abstract = {{In order to remove toxic heavy metals from municipal wastewater sludges,
   the ex situ electrokinetic technique was studied at pilot scale. This
   study focused on the feasibility of the electrokinetic removal of heavy
   metals from sludge and the effectiveness of this technique on the
   variations of abiotic (physicochemical) and biotic (intracellular and
   extracellular) speciations of heavy metals using several analytical
   methods. Even though the sludge used was taken from a municipal
   wastewater treatment plant, the sludge contained relatively high
   concentrations of target metal contaminants (Cd = 6.8 mg/kg, Cr=
   115.6mg/kg, Cu= 338.7 mg/kg, and Pb = 62.8 mg/kg). The removal
   efficiencies of heavy metals were significantly dependent on their
   speciations in the sludge matrices. The electrokinetic removal
   efficiencies of abiotic heavy metals exceeded 70\% for the mobile and
   weakly bound fractions, such as, the exchangeable and carbonate
   fractions and were lower than 35\% for the strongly bound fractions,
   such as, the organic/sulfide and residual fractions. In the case of the
   biotic heavy metals, the removal efficiencies of the extracellular
   fractions were slightly higher than those of the intracellular
   fractions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   cultivated under different substrate and hydrodynamic conditions. Oxygen
   concentration profiles were measured with microelectrodes in the biofilm
   and in the boundary layer directly in the biofilm tube reactors. The
   thickness of the concentration boundary layer was found to depend on the
   surface structure of the biofilm. The hydrodynamic conditions and the
   substrate load during the growth phase of the biofilm in biofilm systems
   are two key parameters that influence the biofilm growth, particularly
   the structure, density and thickness. The measured substrate conversion
   rates, biofilm densities and the boundary layer thickness were used to
   formulate an equation for the mass transfer in biofilm tube reactors.

Abstract = {{The fate of atrazine in agricultural soils has been studied extensively
   but attenuation in wetland systems has received relatively little
   attention. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the mineralization
   of atrazine in two wetlands in central Ohio. One was a constructed
   wetland, which is fed by Olentangy River water from an agricultural
   catchment area. The other was a natural fen (Cedar Bog) in proximity to
   atrazine-treated cornfields. Atrazine mineralization potential was
   measured by (CO2)-C-14 evolution from {[}U-ring-C-14]-atrazine in
   biometers. The constructed wetland showed 70-80\% mineralization of
   atrazine within 1 month. Samples of wetland water that were
   pre-concentrated 200-fold by centrifugation also mineralized 60-80\% of
   the added atrazine. A high extent of atrazine mineralization (75-81\%
   mineralized) was also associated with concentrated water samples from
   the Olentangy River that were collected upstream and downstream of the
   wetland. The highest levels of mineralization were localized to the top
   5 cm zone of the wetland sediment, and the activity close to the outflow
   at the Olentangy wetland was approximately equal to that near the
   inflow. PCR amplification of DNA extracted from the wetland sediment
   samples showed no positive signals for the atzA gene (atrazine
   chlorohydrolase), while Southern blots of the amplified DNA showed
   positive bands in five of the six Olentangy wetland sediment samples.
   Amplification with the trzD (cyanuric acid amidohydrolase) primers
   showed a positive PCR signal for all Olentangy wetland sediment samples.
   There was little mineralization of atrazine in any of the Cedar Bog
   samples. DNA extracted from Cedar Bog samples did not yield PCR
   products, and the corresponding Southern hybridization signals were
   absent. The data show that sediment microbial communities in the
   Olentangy wetland mineralize atrazine. The level of activity may be
   related to the seasonality of atrazine runoff entering the wetiand.
   Comparable activity was not observed in the Cedar Bog, perhaps because
   it does not directly receive agricultural runoff. Qualitatively, the
   detection of the genes was associated with measurable mineralization
   activity which was consistent with the differences between the two study
   sites. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Scolecite is a zeolite associated to basalts of the Parana Continental
   Igneous Province (PCIP, South America). The potential of scolecite as a
   new material for heavy metal removal (Pb2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, CO2+ and
   Cd2+) from aqueous solutions is evaluated. The experiments were carried
   out by immersion of 0.5g of sample in solutions containing the metal
   ions, and kept under constant agitation for 24h, at ambient temperature.
   The meq of cations retained per mass of scolecite was evaluated as a
   function of. initial concentration (5-60 mg L-1), pH (4-6), liquid/solid
   ratio (200, 1000 and 2000) and particle size. The results indicated a
   great affinity of scolecite for Cu2+ with a retention value of 130 mueq
   g(-1) at pH 6, C-i = 30mgL(-1) and liquid/solid ratio of 200. In the
   same conditions, the maximum retention measured for the other ions were
   64 mueq g(-1) (Zn2+), 56 mueq g(-1) (Pb2+), 31 mueq g(-1) (Ni2+), 7.8
   mueq g(-1) (CO2+) and 3.2 mueq g(-1) (Cd2+). These values increase
   substantially when the L/S ratio is increased. The affinity of copper
   and lead for scolecite is discussed based on their free ionic forms
   (i.e., their hydrated bivalent ions) and their hydrolysis products. The
   remaining ions are retained as free ions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this study, a multi-cathode biofilm-electrode reactor (BER) combined
   with microfiltration (MF) was investigated using a laboratory-scale
   experimental apparatus for treatment of nitrate-contaminated water. The
   multi-cathode electrodes were composed of multiple-granular activated
   carbons (GACs). GACs attached to each cathode to enlarge surface area of
   electrodes and to attach bacteria quickly and firmly. In BER, H-2 gas is
   produced by applying electric current, which serves as an electron donor
   in biological reduction of nitrate to N-2 gas. Since some suspended
   solids were escaping from BER, MF membrane with plate modules and a pore
   size of 0.2 mum was placed after BER. Experimental results demonstrated
   that it was possible to operate the multi-cathode BER with high
   denitrification rates and hydraulic retention time (HRT) as low as HRT =
   20 min. The denitrification rate was enhanced by 3-60 times in
   comparison with former studies. MF membrane successfully rejected the
   bacteria escaping from BER, so that the effluent concentration of SS was
   kept below 1 mg SS/l throughout the experiment. It was also possible to
   operate MF membrane at flux 2-9 times higher and pressure 2.5-31 times
   smaller than in former studies. This higher performance was mainly
   brought about by using biofilm and H-2 gas as an electron donor. Also,
   an economic evaluation of BER/MF was included, showing the feasibility
   of this process. The present BER/MF process is considered advantageous
   for the enhanced treatment of nitrate-polluted groundwater. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Biological treatment of high-salinity industrial wastewaters using
   halophilic bacteria can be used to remove organic compounds without
   first decreasing the salt concentration. While halophilic degradation of
   phenol and other organics has been investigated, there exists a general
   absence of kinetic data in current literature to allow evaluation of
   this treatment alternative. Liquid, soil and sediment samples were
   collected from three distinct saline environments in the western United
   States. Samples were enriched in media containing 10\% (w/v) NaCl at pH
   7.0, with phenol as a substrate. Mixed culture batch experiments were
   conducted at 30degreesC with initial phenol concentrations of 50 mg/L.
   Evaluation of phenol degradation and corresponding cell growth data with
   Monod and Andrews models indicated that the kinetics were zero-order
   with respect to phenol. Zero-order specific growth rates ranged from
   0.22 to 0.32 h(-1), while observed cell yields were 0.18-0.28 mg cell
   protein/mg phenol for the five cultures. For one of the cultures, phenol
   degradation rates were also quantified at concentrations of up to 320
   mg/L. Under these conditions, specific growth rates ranged from 0.09 to
   0.22 h(-1), decreasing with increasing initial phenol concentrations.
   Cell yields at these higher initial phenol concentrations ranged from
   0.20 to 0.29 mg cell protein/mg phenol. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Some intermediates were identified during the course of non-catalytic
   wet air oxidation (WAO) of cellulose. Concentrations of by-products were
   determined in function of temperature and reaction time. This study also
   showed that hydroxyl radicals (HO.) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) play
   the role of intermediates in the initial phase of the oxidation
   reactions. Hydroxyl radicals were detected by the electron spin
   resonance spectroscopy coupled to the spin trapping technique using the
   5,5-dimethyl 1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as spin trap agent. The spin
   adduct (DMPO/ HO.), resulting from the trapping of HO. with DMPO, showed
   a characteristic electron spin resonance signal which was inhibited when
   catalase was added, indicating that HO. was provided from H2O2. These
   transient species were only observed at the beginning of the reaction
   and were not oxygen dependent. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A new liquid chromatographic (LC) method with automated on-line solid
   phase extraction was developed to determine caffeine at sub-microgram
   per litre concentrations in waters. The filtered sample was
   pre-concentrated in a pre-column, which was backwashed with acidic water
   at pH of 2.70. The concentrated caffeine was separated using a C-18
   column with a gradient of water-acetonitrile and detected by diode array
   detection (DAD) at 210 nm. Four different pre-columns: C18, PRP-1,
   PLRP-s and Env were evaluated for the on-line solid phase extraction of
   caffeine. The PLRPs pre-column allowed the enrichment of up to 100mL of
   environmental water sample with highest recovery. The procedure was
   validated by recovery experiments in water spiked at 0.5 1.0 and 4.0
   mug/L. Average recoveries were between 92.1 +/- 5.2\% and 97.8 +/-
   2.6\%. Detection limits as low as 0.1 mug/L from 50 ml of sample were
   achieved. The proposed method has the advantages of higher reliability
   and sensitivity, simpler sample preparation and shorter analysis time in
   comparison with off-line solid-phase extraction. The utility of the
   method was demonstrated at two field sites: Bolivar and Halls Head
   (Australia). At Bolivar, the treatment process included 6-week lagoon
   storage which is believed to have attenuated caffeine, and thus limited
   its use as an environmental tracer of reclaimed water. At the Halls Head
   site, where the storage period is shorter, caffeine was detected in both
   the treated sewage effluent and in groundwater near ponds where the
   reclaimed water is at similar concentrations. These results suggest that
   the environmental conditions under which caffeine is conservative
   require better definition. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A mathematical model describing nitrification (nitritification plus
   nitratification) and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) combined in
   a biofilm reactor was developed. Based on this model, a previously
   proposed one-reactor completely autotrophic ammonium removal over
   nitrite (CANON) process was evaluated for its temperature dependency and
   behaviour under variable inflow. The temperature-dependency of growth
   rates of the involved organisms is described by an Arrhenius-type
   equation. If temperature decreases, the activities of the involved
   organisms decrease. This means that thicker biofilms are needed or the
   ammonium surface load (ASL) to the biofilm should be decreased to
   maintain full N-removal at lower temperatures. Although the growth rate
   of nitrite oxidisers is higher than that of ammonium oxidisers at lower
   temperatures, these organisms can be effectively competed out due to a
   lower oxygen affinity. Variable inflow or dissolved oxygen (DO)
   concentration negatively affect the N-removal efficiency due to an
   unbalance between applied ASL load and required oxygen concentration. A
   variation of the dissolved oxygen concentration in a small range (
   +/-0.2g O-2/m(3)) has no significant influence on the process
   performance, which means that requirements on electrode sensitivity and
   a DO control scheme are not too stringent. A variable ASL has obvious
   influence on the process performance, at both constant and variable DO.
   A good adjustment of DO in accordance with the variable ASL is needed to
   optimise the N-removal efficiency. At T = 20degreesC, an N-removal
   efficiency of 88\% is possible at ASL = 0.5 g NH4+ - N/m(2) d, in a
   biofilm of at least 0.7 mm. thickness and a DO level of 3 4 0.3 g
   O-2/m(3) in the bulk liquid. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Growth and delta-endotoxin yield of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) subsp
   kurstaki in tryptic soy yeast extract (TSY) medium, soybean meal based
   commercial medium and wastewater sludge medium were studied. The viable
   spores (VS) count in sludge medium was comparable to that obtained in
   laboratory and commercial media. The entomotoxicity of the fermentation
   liquid (Bt grown sludge) against Choristoneura fumiferana was comparable
   to the concentrated commercial Bt formulation available in the market
   (Foray 48B). A higher entomotoxicity was observed in a sludge medium
   than in the TSY or soybean meal media. The secondary and mixed (mixture
   of primary and secondary) sludges from various wastewater treatment
   plants were also evaluated for spore formation and entomotoxicity yield.
   The VS count was higher in a mixed sludge compared to the secondary
   sludge at a similar sludge solids concentration. Both VS count and
   entomotoxicity yield was found to be a function of sludge solids
   concentration in the medium. The optimum value of solids concentration
   for Biota production was found to be 25 g 1(-1) (dry weight basis).
   Beyond this concentration, a drop in VS count and entomotoxicity yield
   was observed. A low C:N ratio in the secondary sludge and a high C:N
   ratio in the mixed sludge resulted in a higher entomotoxicity. The
   optimum value of C:N ratio in combined sludge for Bt production was
   found to be 7.9-9.9. Relationships between entomotoxicity and maximum
   specific growth as well as with specific sporulation rate were
   developed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and
   coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (Co-PCBs) analyses in raw and treated
   water throughout Japan were implemented to identify the concentration
   and homologue patterns of dioxins before and after the water treatment
   process. In 40 surface water and 5 ground water treatment plants, the
   removal efficiency of dioxins and the influence of extent chlorination
   on dioxins increase in drinking water were also studied. Raw water and
   treated water were sampled twice, summer and winter. The mean
   concentration in raw water and treated water of dioxins was 56.45 pg/L
   (0.15 pg WHO-TEQ/L) and 4.24pg/L (0.019pg WHO-TEQ/L), respectively.
   Location of water treatment plants not only significantly influenced the
   concentration level of dioxins but also resulted in different homologue
   patterns of dioxins. Levels of dioxins in ground water were much less
   than that of surface water in both raw and treated water. This study
   shows most dioxin congeners are well removed (87\% removal efficiency)
   by water treatment. However, in some water treatment plants, the level
   of TeCDFs (pg WHO-TEQ/L) increased as a result of chlorination. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The transport through polymer inclusion membranes (PIMs) was found as
   the effective and selective method of chromium(VI) anions removal from
   chloride acidic aqueous solutions. The optimal PIMs content was as
   follows: 41 wt\% of cellulose triacetate as the support, 23 wt\% of
   tri-n-octylamine as the ionic carrier, and 36 wt\% of o-nitrophenyl
   pentyl ether as the plasticizer. The results obtained show a linear
   decrease of permeability coefficient and initial flux values with source
   phase pH increase. Also linear decrease of initial flux in log log scale
   with chromium(VI) concentration increase was observed. Value of slope of
   this relationship was found to be 0.96 which indicates a first order of
   chromium(VI) reaction with tri-n-octylamine at membrane/aqueous source
   interface. Transport of chromium(VI) through PIMs reduces the
   concentration of chromium(VI) in source aqueous phase from 1.0 to 0.0028
   ppm, which is below permissible limit in drinking water in Poland.
   Competitive transport of chromium(VI), cadmium(II), zinc(II), and
   iron(III) from acidic aqueous solution across PIMs was found to be
   efficient for chromium(VI) (99\%), and cadmium(II) (99\%). (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Blast furnace sludge is a waste originating from pig iron production and
   contains small amounts of iron-cyanide complexes. Leaching of
   iron-cyanide complexes from deposited blast furnace sludge into the
   ground water seems to be possible in principle. We investigated the
   sorption of the iron-cyanide complexes ferrocyanide,
   {[}Fe-II(CN)(6)](4-), and ferricyanide, {[}Fe-III(CN)(6)](3-), in 22
   samples of deposited blast furnace sludge in batch experiments.
   Subsequently, desorption of iron-cyanide complexes was investigated
   using 1 M NaCl. Sorption in five samples was evaluated with Langmuir
   isotherms. The blast furnace sludge samples were neutral to slightly
   alkaline (pH 7.6-9) and consisted of X-ray amorphous compounds and
   crystalline Fe oxides primarily. X-ray amorphous compounds are assumed
   to comprise coke-bound C and amorphous Fe, Zn, and Al oxides. The
   experiments that were evaluated with Langmuir isotherms indicated that
   the extent of ferricyanide sorption was higher than that of ferrocyanide
   sorption. Saturation of blast furnace sludge with iron-cyanide complexes
   was achieved. Sorption of iron-cyanide complexes in 22 blast furnace
   sludge samples at one initial concentration showed that 12 samples
   sorbed more ferrocyanide than ferricyanide. The extent of sorption
   largely differed between 0.07 and 2.76 mumol {[}Fe(CN)6(]) m(-2) and was
   governed by coke-bound C. Ferricyanide sorption was negatively
   influenced by crystalline Fe oxides additionally. Only small amounts of
   iron-cyanide complexes sorbed in blast furnace sludge were desorbed by 1
   M NaCl (ferrocyanide, 3.2\%; ferricyanide, 1.1\%, given as median). This
   indicated strong interactions of iron-cyanide complexes in blast furnace
   sludge. The mobility of iron-cyanide complexes in deposited blast
   furnace sludge and consequently contamination of the seepage and ground
   water was designated as low, because (i) deposited blast furnace sludge
   is able to sorb iron-cyanide complexes strongly, (ii) the. solubility of
   the iron-cyanide-containing phase, K2Zn3{[}Fe-II(CN)(6)].9H(2)O, is
   known to be low, and (iii) a worst case scenario of the transport of
   iron-cyanide complexes within the blast furnace sludge deposit indicated
   strong retardation of the complexes within the next 100 years. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Waters from five reservoirs and ``synthetic waters{''}, prepared using
   terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) extracted from
   vegetation and reservoir catchment soils, were studied for their
   treatability with alum using ajar test procedure. DOM in drinking water
   is a precursor for the formation of trihalomethanes (THM) following
   chlorine disinfection and can also be a substrate for microbial growth
   in the drinking water distribution system. The trihalomethane formation
   potential (THMFP) represents an upper concentration limit on THMs formed
   by chlorination, while bacterial regrowth potential (BRP) is an
   indicator of the bioavailability of DOM. BRP and THMFP were measured
   before and after alum treatment and the results were related to the
   source of the DOM. It was found that freshly derived terrestrial DOM in
   synthetic water resulted in higher THMFP and BRP than DOM in reservoir
   waters. For the samples investigated, conventional alum treatment did
   not always reduce the THM precursor levels formed in laboratory tests
   below the NH\&MRC (1996) guideline level of 250 mug/L nor produce
   microbially stable waters. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Trihalomethanes (THMs), a by-product of the chlorination of natural

   considerable public health concern and regulation due to their potential

   treatment process that lowers the concentration of bromide in drinking
   water and thus, lowers the THM formation potential. Bromide is oxidized
   by electrolysis to bromine and then the bromine apparently volatilized.
   The electrolyzed water, when chlorinated, produces measurably lower
   amounts of THMs and proportionately fewer brominated THMs, which are of
   greater public health concern than the chlorinated THMs. Removing
   bromide should also reduce the formation of other disinfection

   broad-spectrum fungicide, did not show any transformation when incubated
   alone with a laccase from Trametes villosa. It was transformed to a
   significant extent, however, when a mediator was present. All of the 13
   tested mediators belonged to the group of naturally occurring phenols.
   With some exceptions (2,6-dimethoxyphenol, syringic acid, and ferulic
   acid), phenols substituted with one or two methoxy groups were very
   effective mediators. In experiments with C-14-labeled cyprodinil, the
   radioactive label was largely associated with brown transformation
   products that precipitated out of the aqueous solution. As determined by
   mass spectrometry, the products were mixed oligomers resulting from
   cross-coupling between cyprodinil and a mediator. The addition of large
   amounts of humic acid (HA) (400 mg/L) to the reaction mixtures involving
   the most effective mediators reduced cyprodinil transformation
   (42.6-68.6\%) by 12-48\%, probably due to an inhibitory effect. The
   inhibition decreased with decreasing concentration of HA. The addition
   of HA (400 mg/L) to the reaction mixtures involving the least effective
   mediators or no mediators (control) enhanced cyprodinil transformation
   (0.3-17.6\%) by 2.9-17.1\%, probably as a result of binding to HA. (C)

Abstract = {{Widespread arsenic contamination of groundwater has been reported of
   late in Bangladesh and West Bengal state of India. On the basis of
   arsenic geochemistry, three probable mechanisms have been cited for
   arsenic mobility in aquifers of West Bengal and Bangladesh. First,
   mobilization of arsenic due to the oxidation of arsenic-bearing pyrite
   minerals. Second, dissolution of arsenic-contaminated iron
   oxy-hydroxides (FeOOH) due to onset of reducing conditions in the
   subsurface. Third, due to the release of arsenic sorbed to aquifer
   minerals by competitive exchange with phosphate ions, that migrates into
   aquifers due to application of fertilizer to surface soil. Based on the
   review of field data from the affected region, it appears that the
   second mechanism described above is the most probable. Two reduction
   processes associated with this mechanism were investigated, viz.,
   reduction of iron oxy-hydroxide to iron (II), which results in the
   mobilization of arsenic, and reduction of arsenic (V) to arsenic (III),
   which may enhance mobility of arsenic under certain conditions. These
   reactions, in the opinion of some researchers, are possible in
   subsurface environments mainly through microbial intervention. However,
   through the data presented in this paper, it has been demonstrated that
   above red-ox reactions involving iron and arsenic are also possible
   through predominantly abiotic pathways. While these results do not
   necessarily imply that abiotic red-ox processes are dominant in all
   subsurface environments containing iron and arsenic, it is entirely
   possible that abiotic interactions as described here may be responsible
   for a substantial amount of transformations involving iron and arsenic
   in anoxic subsurface environments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Title = {{Anoxic growth of phosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs) in biological

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2002}},

Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{4927-4937}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, research on the growth performance of
   phosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs) was conducted based on
   literature and experimental investigations on biological nutrient
   removal (BNR) activated sludge (BNRAS) systems. The research aims at
   presenting the occurrence of denitrifying PAOs (DPAOs), abstracting
   information on the kinetics and stoichiometry of PAOs under anoxic
   conditions and determining the conditions that stimulate the PAO growth
   under anoxic conditions. The research results indicate that the PAOs are
   capable of utilizing nitrate as electron acceptor instead of oxygen in
   BNRAS systems, particularly in external, nitrification BNRAS (ENBNRAS)
   systems. However, the growth yield of PAOs under anoxic conditions
   should be reduced to about 70\% of that under aerobic conditions, and
   further the stoichiometric coefficient for anoxic P uptake per PHB COD
   utilized should be reduced to about 80\% of that under aerobic
   conditions as the DPAOs show a significantly lower BEPR performance and
   use the influent RBCOD less ``efficiently{''} compared with aerobic PAOs
   (APAOs). The research results also indicate that the major factor
   influencing the occurrence of DPAOs and associated anoxic P uptake is
   the nitrate load into the anoxic reactor, i.e. the nitrate load should
   be large enough or exceeds the denitrification potential of ordinary
   heterotrophic organisms (OHOs), i.e. non-PAO organisms in the anoxic
   reactor to stimulate DPAOs in the system as the specific denitrification
   rate of OHOs (K-2(OHO)') is significantly larger than that of PAOs
   (K-2(PAO)') In terms of this competition, if the nitrate load into the
   main anoxic reactor is less than the denitrification potential of OHOs,
   then the OHOs will outcompete PAOs for using the limited nitrate, while
   if the nitrate load in the main anoxic reactor exceeds the
   denitrification potential of OHOs, then the PAOs would have
   opportunities to use the ``excess{''} nitrate and so develop in the
   system. The other factors that influence DPAOs include the system
   aerobic mass fraction, sequence of reactors and frequency of sludge
   alternation between the aerobic and anoxic states. Although it does
   appear that these factors above may significantly influence the fraction
   of DPAOs (eta(G)), the quantitative relationship between these factors
   and eta(G) is not known, and the experimental observations indicate that
   this will be system-specific, and require calibration for each
   situation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{(T)he purpose of this research was to present engineering properties of
   modified sludge from water/wastewater treatment by modifiers such as
   hydrated lime, loess, and fly ash. The proper mixing ratio was
   determined to hold the pH of the modified sludge above 12.0 for 2 h.
   Laboratory tests carried out in this research included particle
   analysis, compaction and CBR, SEM and X-ray diffraction, unconfined
   compression test, permeability test, and TCLP test. The main role of
   lime was to sterilize microorganisms in the sludge. The unconfined
   strength of the modified sludge by fly ash and loess satisfied the
   criteria for construction materials, which was above 100 kPa. The
   permeability of all the mixtures was around 1.0x10(-7) cm/s. Extraction
   tests for hazardous components in modified sludge revealed below the
   regulated criteria, especially for cadmium, copper, and lead. The
   present study suggested that the use of lime, fly ash, and loess be an
   another alternative to modify or stabilize water/wastewater treatment
   sludge as construction materials in civil engineering. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Laboratory-scale experiments were performed to develop a procedure for
   biological treatment of recalcitrant anaerobic industrial effluent (from
   ethanol and citric acid production) using first the microalga Chlorella
   vulgaris followed by the macrophyte Lemna minuscula. This recalcitrant
   dark-colored wastewater, containing high levels of organic matter and
   low pH, prevents the growth of microalgae and macrophytes, and
   therefore, could not be treated by them. Therefore, the wastewater was
   diluted to 10\% of the original concentration with wash water from the
   production line. Within 4 days of incubation in the wastewater, C
   vulgaris population grew from 5 x 10(5) to 2 x 10(6) cells/mL. This
   culture reduced ammonium ion (71.6\%), phosphorus (28\%), and chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) (61\%), and dissolved a floating microbial biofilm
   after 5 days of incubation. Consequently, L. minuscule was able to grow
   in the treated wastewater (from 7 to 14g/bioreactor after 6 days),
   precipitated the microalgal cells (by shading the culture), and reduced
   other organic matter and color (up to 52\%) after an additional 6 days
   of incubation. However, L. minuscula did not improve removal of
   nutrients. This study demonstrates the feasibility of combining
   microalgae and macrophytes for bioremediation of recalcitrant industrial
   wastewater. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An anaerobic mixed microbial culture was enriched from soil and
   groundwater taken from a site contaminated with trichloroethene (TCE).
   This enrichment culture was divided into four subcultures amended
   separately with either perchloroethene (PCE), TCE, cis-dichloroethene
   (cDCE) or vinyl chloride (VC). In each of the four subcultures, the
   chlorinated ethenes were rapidly, consistently, and completely converted
   to ethene at rates of 30-50 mumol/l of culture per day, or an average
   160 mu-electron equivalents/l of culture per day. These cultures were
   capable of sustained and rapid dechlorination of VC, and could not
   dechlorinate 1,2-dichloroethane, differentiating them from
   Dehalococcoides ethenogenes, the only known isolate capable of complete
   dechlorination of PCE to ethene. Chloroform (CF) and
   1,1,1-trichloroethane, frequent groundwater co-contaminants with TCE and
   PCE, inhibited chlorinated ethene dechlorination. Most strongly
   inhibited was the final conversion of VC to ethene, with complete
   inhibition occurring at an aqueous CIF concentration of 2.5 muM.
   Differences in rates and community composition developed between the
   different subcultures, including the loss of the VC enrichment culture's
   ability to dechlorinate PCE. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of
   amplified bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments identified three different
   DNA sequences in the enrichment cultures, all phylogenetically related
   to D. ethenogenes. Based on the PCR-DGGE results and substrate
   utilization patterns, it is apparent that significant mechanistic
   differences exist between each step of dechlorination from TCE to
   ethene, especially for the last important dechlorination step from VC to
   ethene. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last two decades, the application of photodegradation for the
   destruction of a wide spectrum of organic compounds in air has gained
   considerable interest in abating environmental pollution. This paper
   presents the results of a fundamental study conducted to evaluate the
   gas phase oxidation kinetics of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with
   respect to different parameters pertinent to the operating conditions of
   air stripping and soil vapor extraction processes. Photodegradations of
   three chlorinated VOCs: chloroform, carbon tetrachloride (CTC) and
   trichloroethylene (TCE), were investigated in a semi-batch reactor using
   a low-pressure mercury UV lamp. The effects of different experimental
   parameters, such as the initial concentrations of the VOCs, the reaction
   medium, relative humidity, light intensity, temperature and the effect
   of mixture that may influence the kinetics of the gas phase
   photodegradation were evaluated. Mechanisms of photodegradation as
   supported by the experimental data are also proposed. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The study of Al speciation is of interest for the assessment of soil and
   water quality. For the measurement of ``free{''} aluminum (Al3+), a
   recently developed Donnan membrane technique was tested by measuring
   Al3+ in aluminium-fluoride solutions and gibbsite suspensions. It shows
   that the Donnan membrane technique can measure free Al3+ reliably up to
   10(-9) M and the equilibration takes 3-4 days. Next, Al binding to humic
   acid (HA) purified from a forest soil was measured using either the
   Donnan membrane technique or gibbsite suspension. Results were compared
   with those predicted with the non-ideal consistent competitive
   adsorption (NICA)-Donnan model. The predictions using the generic
   parameters without fitting were in reasonable agreement with the
   measured data. Finally, the Donnan membrane technique was used to
   determine Al binding to dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the solutions
   of 24 soil samples at pH interval of 3-7. Measurements agree well with
   the predictions using the NICA-Donnan model assuming 30\% of DOM is HA
   and 30\% is fulvic acid. With this model, the effects of pH and DOM
   changes on the concentration of Al in 81 soil solutions were predicted
   reasonably without adjustment of model parameters. The comparison
   between the results of analysis and the modeling provides a mutual
   validation for the two methods. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A new method for the study of pathogen transport in porous media is
   presented. The method is based on conjugation of fluorescent dyes to
   target bacteriophages and application of the modified bacteriophages for
   tracer studies. We demonstrate that the relevant transport determining
   properties of Rhodamine and several fluorescein-labeled phages are
   practically identical to those of the native bacteriophages.
   The advantages of the proposed method relative to direct enumeration of
   bacteriophages by plaque forming unit method, turbidity, fluorescent
   microspheres, and other alternative tracers are discussed. Notable
   advantages include simple quantitation by optical methods, unbiased
   signals even when virus aggregates are formed, and the ability to
   decouple inactivation kinetics from transport phenomena. Additionally,
   the signal reflects the removal and transport of the studied
   microorganism and not a surrogate. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Viral transport in deep-bed sand filters was studied by a new method
   that enables rapid and simple quantitation of labeled viruses. The
   residence time distribution (RTD) of viruses in the bed was compared to
   the RTD of a fluorescein dye under conditions that simulate a filter
   run.
   The characteristics of the RTD curves for the free dye and the labeled
   bacteriophages followed very different trends during the filter run.
   While the retention time of free dye was practically independent of the
   filtration stage, the average retention time of the labeled
   bacteriophage depended in a non-linear way on filtration time. Average
   virus retention time as well as virus-removal efficiency were minimal at
   the ripening stage, increased during the operational stage and then
   decreased again towards the turbidity breakthrough stage. This complex
   trend reflects two opposing mechanisms that dominate the behavior of the
   filter. During the ripening stage the accumulation of the kaolin-alum
   material in the filter increases the adsorption surface area and retards
   virus mobility. After sufficient kaolin-alum deposit is accumulated in
   the filter, aging and densification of the alum deposit induces size
   exclusion phenomenon giving faster apparent mobility of viruses in the
   filter bed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation pathway of pentachlorophenol (PCP) under ozonation and
   the biodegradability of the resulting intermediates were investigated.
   The objectives were to: (1) provide mechanistic details in the
   ozone-mediated degradation, (2) evaluate the biodegradability of
   resultant intermediates at various progressive stages of ozonation, and
   (3) thereby, assess the feasibility for a coupled chemical-biological
   treatment scheme for PCP. Tests of BOD5, COD, and E. coli toxicity along
   with qualitative and quantitative GC analyses were performed for
   aliquots withdrawn before and after various stages of ozonation and
   biological incubation. Ozonated PCP decomposed under the direct
   nucleophilic attack of ozone through an addition-elimination mechanism,
   resulting in tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone and tetrachloro-p-hydroquinone
   intermediates that were further degraded by O-3 and OH to other
   open-ring products including ketones and acids that eventually led to
   simple oxalic acid and quantitative release of chloride ion. As
   ozonation progressed toward but prior to complete mineralization,
   reaction intermediates became increasingly. more biodegradable prior to
   complete degradation, which suggested the potential of using ozonation
   in conjunction with biological treatment for the effective control of
   chlorinated aromatics. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The technical feasibility and performance of photocatalytic degradation
   of aqueous methomyl (50 mg/L) have been studied at pilot scale in two
   well-defined systems of special interest because natural-solar UV light
   can be used: heterogeneous photocatalysis with titanium dioxide and
   homogeneous photocatalysis by photo-Fenton. The pilot plant is made up
   of compound parabolic collectors specially designed for solar
   photocatalytic applications. Experimental conditions allowed pesticide
   disappearance, degree of mineralisation and toxicity achieved in the two
   photocatalytic systems to be compared. Total disappearance of methomyl
   is attained by photo-Fenton in 60 min and by TiO(2) in 100 min. Hundred
   percent of nitrogen and sulphur are recovered as ammonium and sulphate.
   By contrast, complete mineralisation of total organic carbon (TOC) is
   not achieved even after quite a long time (more than 300 min). Three
   different bioassays (Vibrio fischeri, Daphnia magna and a Microalga)
   have been used for testing the progress of toxicity during treatment.
   All remained toxic down to very low-pesticide concentrations and in some
   bioassays were still toxic after total disappearance of the pesticide.
   Only if treatment is maintained throughout enough mineralisation (i.e.
   TOC disappearance), the toxicity is reduced to below the threshold
   (EC50\%). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Solid-phase micro-extraction has been used for identifying, quantifying
   and following the evolution of intermediate products of octanol
   degradation by two advanced oxidation treatments (AOTs), photocatalytic
   and ultrasound processes, inducing mainly the same active species.
   Headspace extraction enabled direct extraction of the organic compounds
   in a heterogeneous process like photocatalysis. The presence of a solid
   does not affect the extraction percentage of alkanes, alkenes and
   aldehydes while alcohols and carboxylic acids are not completely
   extracted if the extraction time is too short.
   To extract C-3-C-8 alkanes, alkenes and aldehydes a Carboxen/PDMS fiber
   and an extraction time of 25 min are used. The presence of alcohol and
   carboxylic acids requires the use of the presence of salt under acidic
   conditions, a longer extraction time and a polyacrylate fiber (PA),
   having a polar fiber. The in situ derivatization-pyrenyldiazomethane on
   a PA fiber-increases the carboxylic acid extraction containing smaller
   hydrocarboned chain while diazomethane derivatization is not as
   efficient due to its volatility.
   Whatever be the treatment, photocatalysis or ultrasound processes,
   aldehydes are the main intermediate products, which is not surprising
   since the same oxidation species (HO2circle, O-2(circle-), OHcircle) are
   formed. Alkanes and alkenes are also detected in both processes;
   however, alkane formation is more important in photocatalysis while
   alkenes are formed in higher amounts by ultrasound. Moreover, the
   presence of carboxylic acids in more important amounts by ultrasound
   than by photocatalysis is attributed to the presence of holes (h(+)) in
   photocatalysis which induces photo-Kolbe degradation. The sonochemical
   formation of small-chained dienes and alkynes is probably due to
   pyrolysis of hydrophobic compounds in cavitation bubbles. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Bacteria such as fecal coliforms are used as indicators of fecal
   pollution in natural waters. These bacteria are found in the feces of
   most wild and domestic animals and thus provide no information as to the
   source of fecal contamination, yet identification of indicator bacteria
   sources allows improved risk assessment, remediation, and total daily
   maximum load (TDML) assessment of environmental waters. This bacterial
   source tracking study was initiated in order to identify the dominant
   source(s) of fecal contamination in the urban watershed of Stevenson
   Creek in Clearwater, Florida. Five sites that represent areas where
   routine monitoring has previously shown high levels of fecal coliforms
   were sampled over 7 months. Fecal coliforms were enumerated by membrane
   filtration, and antibiotic resistance analysis was used to
   ``fingerprint{''} a subset of randomly selected isolates and
   statistically match them to fingerprints of fecal coliforms from known
   sources (the library). A field test of the classification accuracy of
   the library was carried out by isolating fecal coliforms from the soil
   and waters surrounding a failing onsite wastewater treatment and
   disposal system (OSTDS). The vast majority of the isolates were
   classified into the human category. The major sources of fecal pollution
   in Stevenson Creek over the course of the study were wild animal, human,
   and, to a lesser extent, dog. Overall, wild animal feces were identified
   as the dominant source when fecal coliform levels were high, but when
   fecal coliform levels were low, the dominant source was identified as
   human. The results of this study demonstrate that the sources of fecal
   indicator bacteria within one urban watershed can vary substantially
   over temporal and spatial distances. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) catalyzed by soluble iron or naturally
   occurring soil minerals, (i.e., modified Fenton's reagent) was
   investigated as a basis for mineralizing sorbed and NAPL-phase
   benzo{[}a]pyrene (BaP), a hydrophobic and toxic polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbon, in two soils of different complexity. C-14-Benzo{[}a]pyrene
   was added to silica sand and a silt loam soil, and mineralization was
   investigated using three-level central composite rotatable experimental
   designs. The effects of H2O2 concentration, slurry volume, and iron(II)
   amendment were investigated in the silica sand systems. In a Palouse
   loess silt loam soil, the variables included H2O2 concentration, slurry
   volume, and pH, with H2O2 catalyzed by naturally occurring iron
   oxyhydroxides. Regression equations generated from the data were used to
   develop three-dimensional response surfaces describing BaP
   mineralization. Based on the recovery of C-14-CO2, 70\% BaP
   mineralization was achieved in the sand within 24 h using 15 M H2O2 and
   an iron(II) concentration of 6.6 mM with a slurry volume of 0.3 x the
   field capacity of the sand. For the silt loam soil, 85\% mineralization
   of BaP was observed using 15 M H2O2, no iron amendment, and a slurry
   volume of 20 x the soil field capacity. The balance of the radiolabeled
   carbon remained as unreacted BaP in the soil fraction. Gas-purge
   measurements over 5 d confirmed negligible desorption under nontreatment
   conditions. However, oxidation reactions were complete within 24 h and
   promoted up to 85\% BaP mineralization, documenting that the natural
   rate of desorption/dissolution did not control the rate of oxidation and
   mineralization of the BaP. The results show that catalyzed H2O2 has the
   ability to rapidly mineralize sorbed/NAPL-phase BaP and that
   partitioning, which is often the rate-limiting factor in soil
   remediation, does not appear to limit the rate of vigorous Fenton-like
   treatment. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of the particle boundary layer in the Boadella reservoir
   was studied using an in situ laser optical particle-sizing instrument.
   This layer was found at the bottom of the reservoir from summer until
   the end of the year, when the reservoir was fully mixed. Most of the
   particles in this layer are remnants of the summer algae bloom and are
   trapped in the boundary layer due to the thermal stratification. The
   phytoplankton bloom is mainly composed of diatoms, with diameter d
   similar to 5 mum and green algae with diameter d similar to 15 mum.
   Inorganic particles and decomposed organic particles with d < 3 mum are
   also encountered in the boundary layer. On the other hand, particles
   with diameter between 30 and 100 mum are mostly found in the epilimnion
   of the reservoir. These are a mixture of aggregates of inorganic
   particles, colonies of phytoplankton, zooplankton, detritus, etc.
   Different mixing events occurring during autumn resuspended the small
   particles in the boundary layer, while the greater particles settled
   down. The extent of the resuspension has been parameterized with a
   non-dimensional number that balances the stress across the interface and
   the strength of the stratification. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Complexation properties of two phosphonic acids: nitrilotris
   (methylenephosphonic acid) and 1-hydroxyethane-1,1'-diphosphonic acid,
   with Cu(II) and Ca(II) have been previously determined by pH and ionic
   selective electrode titrations. These phosphonic acids are commonly
   added to washing powders as polyphosphate substitutes and are here
   studied in the presence of another detergent compound:
   tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED), a bleaching activator. Product
   concentrations were chosen in order to correspond to component
   concentration ratios encountered in washing powders. Potentiometric
   titrations were carried out to determine the possible TAED
   interferences; they indicate that TAED and its by-products have no
   action on phosphonic acid complexing behaviour. Under our experimental
   conditions, the action of TAED was modelled with acetic acid and
   ethylenediamine, the final by-products of TAED hydrolysis. If we take
   into account both phosphonic and acetic acids, speciation diagrams
   corresponding to representative fresh water systems showed that the
   acetic acid does not influence cation speciation. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The goal of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of innovative
   drinking-water treatments designed to remove toxic and mutagenic organic
   micropollutants from lake waters used for human consumption. The widely
   used adsorption on granular activated carbon (GAC) filter technique was
   compared with the more innovative resin column techniques (XAD-4 and
   Ambersorb-563) and with the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) with
   UV/O-3 and UV/O-3/H2O2. The water samples, collected from lake Como,
   treated with these techniques were analysed for mutagenic activity using
   Ames assay, toxicity using bioluminescent bacteria and organic compound
   were characterized using the GC-MS technique. The results found a
   decrease of the mutagenic and toxic activities of the lake water after
   adsorption on GAC and resins, while the AOP process generally increased
   these parameters. The absence of mutagenic activity was found only when
   a GAC adsorption step was performed in addition to the AOP process.
   Similar results were obtained by the toxicological and chemical
   analyses. In addition, the GC-MS analysis identified some possible
   mutagenic agents. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microbiological nitrification process may lead to chemical,
   microbiological and technical problems in drinking water distribution
   systems. Nitrification activity is regulated by several physical, and
   chemical, and operational factors. However, the factors affecting
   nitrification in the distribution systems in boreal region, having its
   specific environmental characteristics, are poorly known. We studied the
   occurrence and activity of nitrifying bacteria in 15 drinking water
   networks distributing water with very different origin and treatment
   practices. The waters included chloraminated surface water, chlorinated
   surface water, and non-disinfected groundwater. The networks were
   located in eight towns in different parts of Finland. Our results showed
   that nitrifying bacteria are common in boreal drinking water
   distribution systems despite their low temperature. Surprisingly high
   numbers and activities of nitrifiers were detected in pipeline sediment
   samples. The numbers of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and their oxidation
   potentials were highest in chloraminated drinking water delivering
   networks, whereas the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria were present in the
   greatest numbers in those networks that used non-disinfected
   groundwater. The occurrence of nitrifying bacteria in drinking water
   samples correlated positively with the numbers of heterotrophic bacteria
   and turbidity, and negatively with the content of total chlorine.
   Although nitrifying bacteria grew well in drinking water distribution
   systems, the problems with nitrite accumulation are rare in Finland. (C)

Abstract = {{A procedure that uses Landsat imagery to estimate Secchi disk
   transparency (SDT) of lakes was developed and applied to similar to 500
   lakes with surface areas > 10ha in the seven-county metropolitan area of
   Minneapolis and St. Paul, MN, USA, to assess spatial patterns and
   temporal trends in lake clarity. Thirteen Landsat MSS and TM images over
   the period 1973-1998 were used for the analysis. Satellite brightness
   values from lake surfaces were calibrated against available historical
   data on SDT (n = similar to 20-40) measured nearly contemporaneously
   with the acquisition date of each image. Calibration regression
   equations for the late-summer TM images had a range of r(2) from 0.72 to
   0.93. Regression analysis for three late-summer MSS images yielded r(2)
   values ranging from 0.60 to 0.79. Results indicate that a single
   late-summer image yields a reliable estimate of regional lake clarity
   and reasonably accurate estimates of SDT for individual lakes. An
   analysis of seasonal patterns on a large lake water-quality database was
   used to develop a model that adjusts synoptic satellite SDT estimates
   from different dates to a common reference, making them more comparable
   from year-to-year. Analysis of long-term trends shows that in spite of
   the large land-use changes within the region over the study period, only
   49 (about 10\%) of assessed lakes in the region showed significant
   temporal trends in SDT over the period, and more lakes had increasing
   SDT (34) than decreasing SDT (15). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The fugacity-based quantitative water-air-sediment interaction (QWASI)
   model is described which can be used to establish a mass balance for an
   organic or metallic contaminant in a lake ecosystem consisting of water,
   suspended matter, bottom sediments and the atmosphere. A suite of such
   models is described and discussed with various degrees of complexity
   including versions treating equilibrium and non-equilibrium situations,
   steady-state and dynamic conditions with either single or multiple
   segments. It is suggested that when seeking to apply a mass balance
   model to a specific lake and contaminant situation, it is desirable to
   start with a simple model and increase the complexity as circumstances
   dictate. This approach is illustrated by application of QWASI models to
   the Rihand Reservoir in India for lindane and benzo(a)pyrene. The roles
   are discussed by which such models can contribute to improved management
   of chemicals that may adversely affect aquatic systems, especially in
   developing regions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Potential control of soluble aluminum in drinking water by formation of
   solids other than Al(OH)(3) was examined. At pHs below 6.0, Al+3 solids
   containing sulfate, silica or potassium are thermodynamically favored
   versus amorphous Al(OH)(3); however, in this work no evidence could be
   obtained that solids other than Al(OH)(3) would form in practice. At pHs
   above 9, aluminum and magnesium were discovered to form complex solid
   phases of approximate composition AlMg2(OH)(7), AlMg2SiO2(OH)(7) or
   Al(SiO2)(2)(OH)(3) dependent on circumstance. Formation of these solids
   provide a mechanistic explanation for enhancements to precipitative
   softening obtained in practice by dosing Al+3 salts; that is, improved
   flocculation/settling and removal of silica from water that interferes
   with calcium precipitation. The solids also maintain residual aluminum
   below regulatory guidelines at high pH > 9.5. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The comparative process stability and efficiency of mesophilic
   (35degreesC) and thermophilic anaerobic digestion (55degreesC) has been
   evaluated for four different reactor configurations, which are: daily
   batch-fed single-stage continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR),
   continuously fed single-stage CSTR, daily batch-fed two-phase CSTR, and
   daily batch-fed non-mixed single-stage reactor. The results are
   discussed for three periods: (1) start-up, (2) steady state, and (3)
   organic loading rate (OLR) increase until reactor failure (pH below
   5.5). During the start-up, the single-stage CSTRs at both temperatures
   showed the least stability, while the non-mixed single-stage reactors
   reached steady state in the shortest time with relatively stable pH and
   low volatile fatty acid (VFA). In the case of the thermophilic non-mixed
   reactor, efficient removal of propionate occurred but supplementation of
   nutrients (Ca, Fe, Ni, and Co) was required when VFA increased. The
   results imply the importance of inorganic nutrients bioavailability. The
   comparative results of the reactor performance at steady state clearly
   showed the superior performance of the thermophilic non-mixed reactor
   with respect to lower VFA, higher gas production and volatile solids
   removal implying that microbial consortia proximity can alleviate the
   problem of poor effluent quality in thermophilic system. During the OLR
   increase until reactor failure, all thermophilic reactors except the
   thermophilic non-mixed reactor showed increases in propionate
   concentrations as the OLR increased, while all mesophilic reactors
   except the mesophilic two-phase system showed little increase in VFA
   concentrations. When all reactors had the same conditions with OLR
   increase, the continuously fed reactors showed the lowest gas
   production, while the non-mixed reactors showed the highest gas
   production at both temperatures. It is hypothesized that the non-mixing
   reactor configuration has closer microbial consortia proximity than
   others. Therefore, the results in this study indicated the importance of
   microbial consortia proximity. A proposed model for the effect of the
   distance between two syntrophic bacteria reasonably matched the data in
   this study. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The electrochemical treatability of wastewater from the cigarette
   industry has been investigated in this paper using cast iron electrode.
   The treatment efficiency was monitored in terms of COD, BOD and
   suspended solids concentration. The cast iron anode was found effective
   in treatment of the above-mentioned wastewater. About 56\% of COD and
   84\% of BOD removal was observed at 3.5 A current for 5 h of
   electrolysis. The effect of increase in surface area of anode reduces
   electrolysis time and also energy consumption per kg of COD removal. The
   treated effluent was subjected to chemical coagulation studies using
   Ca(OH)(2) as coagulant. The final treated effluent was found to confirm
   the stipulated standards for safe disposal into surface water bodies
   (Indian Standards). It was concluded that the electrochemical treatment
   followed by chemical coagulation could be opted as an alternate
   treatment scheme for the present industry. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The influence of chlorine on biofilm in low organic carbon environments
   typical of drinking water or industrial process water was examined by
   comparing biomass and kinetic parameters for biofilm growth in a
   chlorinated reactor to those in a non-chlorinated control.
   Mixed-population heterotrophic biofilms were developed in rotating
   annular reactors under low concentration, carbon-limited conditions
   (<2mg/L as carbon) using three substrate groups (amino acids,
   carbohydrates and humic substances). Reactors were operated in parallel
   under identical conditions with the exception that chlorine was added to
   one reactor at a dose sufficient to maintain a free chlorine residual of
   0.09-0.15 mg/L in the effluent. The presence of free chlorine resulted
   in development of less biofilm biomass compared to the control for all
   substrates investigated. However, specific growth and organic carbon
   removal rates were on the average five times greater for chlorinated
   biofilm compared to the control. Observed yield values were less for
   chlorinated biofilm. Although chlorinated biofilm's specific organic
   carbon removal rate was high, the low observed yield indicated organic
   carbon was being utilized for purposes other than creating new cell
   biomass. The impacts of free chlorine on mixed-population biofilms in
   low-nutrient environments were different depending upon the available
   substrate. Biofilms grown using amino acids exhibited the least
   difference between control and chlorinated kinetic parameters; biofilm
   grown using carbohydrates had the greatest differences. These findings
   are particularly relevant to the fundamental kinetic parameters used in
   models of biofilm growth in piping systems that distribute chlorinated,
   low-carbon-concentration water. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Toxicity assays based on bioluminescent bacteria have several advantages
   including a quick response and an easily measured signal. The Shk1 assay
   is a procedure for wastewater toxicity testing based on the
   bioluminescent bacterium Shk1. Using the Shk1 assay, the toxicity of 98
   organic chemicals were measured and EC(50) values were obtained.
   Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models based on the
   logarithm of the octanol-water partition coefficient (log(K(ow))) were
   developed for individual groups of organic chemicals with different
   functional groups. The correlation coefficients for different groups of
   organic compounds varied between 0.69 and 0.99. An overall QSAR model
   without discriminating the functional groups, which can be used for a
   quick estimate of the toxicities of organic chemicals, was also
   developed and model predictions were compared to experimental data. The
   model accuracy was found to be one order of magnitude from the observed
   values. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the factors controlling organic carbon (C) cycling and its
   control of nitrogen (N) removal via denitrification in an aerated
   artificial wetland treating highly concentrated wastewater to
   nutrient-removal standards. Processing of organic material by the
   septage-treating wetland affected the biological reactivity (half-life,
   or t(1/2)) Of organic C pools through microbial degradation and gravity
   fractionation of the influent septage. Primary sedimentation
   fractionated the initial septage material (t(1/2) = 8.4d) into
   recalcitrant waste solids (t1/2 = 16.7d) and highly labile supernatant
   (t(1/2) = 5.0d), allowing this reactive fraction to be further degraded
   during treatment in aerobic wetland tanks until a less labile material
   (t(1/2) = 7.3d) remained. Organic C contributions from in situ fixation
   by nitrifying bacteria or algae in these tanks were small, about 1\% of
   the C degradation rate.
   In the aerated tanks, denitrification was correlated with particulate
   organic C loading rates, although the average C required (0.35 mg C L-1
   h(-1)) to support denitrification was only 12\% of the total C
   respiration rate (2.9 mg C L-1 h(-1)). Additions of plant litter (2.5 g
   C L-1) to the aerated tanks under normal operating conditions doubled
   denitrification rates to 0.58 mg N L-1 h(-1), and reduced effluent
   nitrate levels by half, from 12.7 to 6.4 mg N L-1. However, C
   degradation within the plant litter (0.15 mg C L-1 h(-1)) was sufficient
   to have accounted for only 35\% of the additional denitrification.
   Evidence from laboratory and full-scale plant litter additions as well
   as process monitoring indicates that the stimulation of denitrification
   is due to the respiration-driven formation of anaerobic microsites
   within particulate organic C. In this aerated highly C-loaded
   septage-treating wetland, anaerobic microsite, rather than C substrate
   availability limits denitrification. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A new and simple electrochemical (corrosion) method for recess creation
   for the fabrication of metal and metal-metal oxide microelectrodes has
   been developed. Controlled recess was created in low melting point alloy
   (LMA)-filled micropipettes using slightly acidic 1-3 M ZnCl(2) as the
   electro-corrosion solution. The current was applied from a 3 V DC
   source. The recess length in the LMA-filled micropipette can be
   manipulated as needed for a specific microelectrode by varying the
   electro-corrosion time. The present method is expected to make
   microelectrode fabrication a less tedious process. Dissolved oxygen,
   oxidation-reduction potential and pH microelectrodes have been made
   using the present method and the microelectrode characteristics were
   found to be in conformity with those reported by other researchers. (C)

Abstract = {{A study of the diffusion of organic additives from four polyethylene
   (PE) materials into drinking water was conducted. Various structures of
   organic chemicals were identified in the water extracts by means of gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Most of them presented a
   basic common structure characterised by a phenolic ring typically
   substituted with hindered alkyl groups in positions 2 and 6 on the
   aromatic ring. The structures attributed to some of the chemicals have
   been confirmed using commercial or purposely synthesised standards.
   Unprocessed granules of raw PE were also analysed, in order to
   investigate the origin of the chemicals detected in the water samples.
   Consequently, the presence of some of the compounds was attributed to
   impurities or by-products of typical phenolic additives used as
   antioxidants in pipeline production. Finally, the occurrence of the
   identified chemicals was tested under field conditions, i.e. in water
   samples from newly installed pipelines in a distribution system. Here,
   the presence of three of the compounds identified in vitro was detected.

Abstract = {{There are regions where microbial growth in drinking water is limited by
   phosphorus instead of organic carbon. In phosphorus limited waters small
   changes in phosphorus concentration significantly affect microbial
   growth. We studied how water treatment processes in waterworks affect
   the availability of microbial nutrients and microbial growth potential
   in drinking water. The nutrients studied were assimilable organic carbon
   (AOC(potential)) and microbially available phosphorus (MAP) which both
   were quantified by bioassays. Chemical coagulation, commonly used in
   surfacewater works, effectively removed AOCpotential and MAP. In
   contrast to activated carbon filtration, ozonation increased the
   concentrations of AOC(potential) and MAP, and also microbial growth
   potential. In most of the drinking waters, microbial growth was limited
   by phosphorus, and microbial growth potential correlated with the MAP
   concentration. Microbial growth potential was lowest in drinking waters
   produced from surface waters with efficient treatment technique and
   highest in less treated ground waters. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper describes an experimental investigation into the factors
   which control clogging phenomenon of the filter medium during alum
   sludge filtration under conditions of excess polymer dosing. Preliminary
   studies showed that the hydraulic resistance of the filter medium was
   associated with the amount of polymer trapped, but was not uniquely
   determined by the quantity of polymer trapped in the filter. Subsequent
   investigations showed that filter blinding can arise from the
   interaction of residual polymer and a colloidal fraction. When either of
   these components was missing, the trapping efficiency of the filter was
   low. In particular, the study demonstrated that polymer coatings on the
   filter did not have any significant impact on the hydraulic resistance.
   Evidence indicated that clogging and polymer trapping was particle size
   driven, the aggregate size being dependent on the polymer dose.
   Diagnosis of trends in the filter resistance suggested that they were
   being influenced by polymer/colloidal solids ratio through its effects
   on particle size. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Modified chitosan gel beads, which had been prepared by the molybdate
   adsorption and coagulation (in the presence of molybdate) methods, were
   tested for As(III) and As(V) removal from dilute solutions (in the range
   5-20 mg As L-1). The sorbent is very efficient at removing As(V) from
   acid solutions (optimum pH close to pH 2-3), whereas the sorption
   capacities are significantly lower for As(III) uptake (230 mg As(V)
   g(-1) Mo, 70 mg As(III) g(-1) Mo, respectively). Since the sorption
   proceeds in acidic solutions with a partial release of molybdate and
   with residual concentrations (ca. 500 mug As L-1) above the regulations
   for drinking water, the process appears to be directed to the treatment
   of industrial effluents or as a pre-concentration process. The mechanism
   of As(V) sorption is related to the ability of molybdate ions to complex
   As(V) ions in acid solutions. The uptake mechanism was confirmed by XPS
   analysis and desorption studies. In the case of As(III) sorption the
   mechanism of uptake is not identified since no complex has been cited in
   the literature regarding As(III) binding to Mo (VI), which was also
   identified by XPS analysis as the sorption site. As(V) sorption is not
   influenced by the presence of co-ions, with the exception of phosphate
   anions at low concentration, and silicate at high relative
   concentration. Arsenic desorption can be performed using phosphoric acid
   solutions. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A macroporous calcium-based sorbent made from bentonite, calcium
   hydroxide and Yalloun coal was prepared and tested for its phosphorus
   removal performance. The coal was added as a solid pore-forming agent.
   Pores sizes as large as a few micron were generated when the Yalloun
   coal was incorporated at a relatively high proportion. These pores were
   formed due to the burning out of the added coal during the thermal
   treatment conducted at 700degreesC. Results of phosphorus removal
   experiments showed that the increase of the amount of phosphorus removed
   could be positively correlated with the increase of the total pore
   volume and the mean pore size. Decreases in pore sizes and total pore
   volume were pronounced in sorbents used to remove phosphorus due to the
   formation of a Ca-phosphate mineral on their surfaces. It was suggested
   that the widely formed pores avoided the rapid plugging and contributed
   to maintain the diffusional transport of the substrate to a certain
   extent. Hydroxyapatite was formed and coated on the surface of the
   sorbent during phosphorus removal. On the basis of these results, it was
   concluded that modification of the physical structure of Ca-based
   sorbents by creating large pore sizes, revealed to be effective for
   increasing their phosphorus uptake. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{During the spring-summer period, vibrios were detected in water and
   mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) collected in 30 sampling sites
   located in the Mar Piccolo of Taranto (Ionian Sea, Italy). In order to
   evaluate the degree of microbial pollution of the investigated area,
   fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli densities were also determined.
   Vibrio alginolyticus constituted the predominant component of the total
   culturable vibrios. Some Vibrio species such as V mediterranei, V
   parahaemolyticus, V. diazotrophicus, V. nereis, and V. splendidus were
   present in water as well as in mussel samples; selective retention in
   mussels, however, was demonstrated for other vibrios (V vulnificus, V.
   cincinnatiensis, V. orientalis, V. anguillarum, V marinus, V. hollisae).
   The isolation of some potential pathogenic vibrio species shows the
   importance of Vibrio research to estimate water quality and to avoid
   transmission of infection to man and to other marine organisms. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Methodology was developed for presenting to fish cells in culture
   whole-water samples without extraction and used to evaluate the toxicity
   to a rainbow trout gill cell line, RTgill-W1, of more than 30
   whole-water samples collected from a paper mill over approximately a
   year of operation. Presentation to cells was achieved by adding to water
   samples the amounts of salts, galactose and sodium pyruvate, as solids,
   that were necessary to give concentrations and osmolality of the basal
   growth medium, Leibovitz's L-15. Cell viability was measured with three
   fluorescent indicator dyes: alamar Blue for metabolism,
   5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate acetoxymethyl ester (CFDA-AM) for
   membrane function, and neutral red for lysosomal activity. Eighteen
   samples were tested with the Daphnia lethality bioassay and 11 of these
   were toxic. None of these were judged cytotoxic to RTgill-W1. Sixteen
   samples were tested with the rainbow trout lethality bioassay and only
   one was toxic. This sample was also the only sample that was cytotoxic
   to RTgill-W1. Therefore, these methods for presenting water samples and
   measuring their cytotoxicity to RTgill-W1 are a promising substitute for
   toxicity tests of industrial effluent with rainbow trout but not with
   Daphnia. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of ethanol as an automotive fuel oxygenate represents potential
   economic and air-quality benefits. However, little is known about how
   ethanol may affect the natural attenuation of petroleum product
   releases. Chemostat experiments were conducted with four pure cultures
   (representing archetypes of the known aerobic toluene degradation
   pathways) to determine how ethanol affects benzene, toluene,
   ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) biodegradation kinetics. In all cases,
   the presence of ethanol decreased the metabolic flux of toluene
   (measured as the rate of toluene degradation per cell). This negative
   effect was counteracted by an ethanol-supported increase in biomass,
   which is conducive to faster degradation rates. When the influent total
   organic carbon (TOC) of the toluene-ethanol mixture was kept constant,
   the metabolic flux of toluene was proportional to its relative
   contribution to the influent TOC. This empirical relationship was used
   to derive a mathematical model that simulated effluent benzene
   concentrations as a function of the influent mixed-substrate
   composition, the dilution rate, and Monod kinetic coefficients. Under
   carbon-limiting conditions (1 mg/L influent benzene), the data and model
   simulations showed an increase in benzene removal efficiency when
   ethanol was fed at low concentrations (ca. 1 mg/L) because its positive
   effect on cell growth outweighed its negative effect on the metabolic
   flux of benzene. High ethanol concentrations, however, had a negative
   effect, causing oxygen limitation and increasing effluent benzene
   concentrations to higher levels than when benzene was fed alone. The
   slower BTEX degradation rates expected at sites with high ethanol
   concentrations (e.g., at gasohol-contaminated sites) could result in
   longer BTEX plumes and a greater risk of exposure. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Studying how and to what extent effluent TSS and COD are related to
   influent TSS, COD, and flow in a primary sedimentation process is the
   objective of this paper. The analysis is based on data collected hourly
   over two periods of sampling, each lasted 1 week at an Edmonton, Alberta
   sewage treatment plant. In order to establish a dynamic model for the
   system, the methodology of Box and Jenkins (Time series Analysis:
   Forecasting and Control, Holden-Day, Oakland, CA, 1976) was utilized.
   With this approach, stochastic and transfer-function components can be
   combined to form a dynamic model and the relative importance of these
   two components can be quantitatively assessed. The models were able to
   explain the data very well. Using the models as parts of a real-time
   control scheme was also discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were successfully applied to data
   observations from a small watershed consisting of commonly measured
   indicator bacteria, weather conditions, and turbidity to distinguish
   between human sewage and animal-impacted runoff, fresh runoff from aged,

   land-use-associated-fresh runoff. The ANNs were applied in a cascading,
   or hierarchical scheme. ANN performance was measured in two ways: (1)
   training and (2) testing. An ANN was able to sort sewage from runoff
   with <1\% error. Turbidity was found to be relatively unimportant for
   sorting sewage from runoff, while gross measurements of gram-negative
   and gram-positive bacteria were required. Predictions clustered tightly
   around the known values. ANN classification of aged suburban runoff from
   fresh, and agricultural runoff from suburban was accomplished with >90\%

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to examine the biological treatment of a
   formaldehyde waste simulating wastewater from a resin production
   facility. An analysis of degradation of a high strength organic waste
   stream containing formaldehyde in an anaerobic fluidized bed granular
   activated carbon bioreactor (AFBGAC) is presented. In the first part of
   this study, the AFBGAC bioreactor was operated for a total of 700 days
   under four different continuous loading rates, to optimize the hydraulic
   retention time, until steady state performance was obtained. In the
   second part, the effect of substrate perturbation on effluent quality
   was examined by periodically loading the reactor using five distinct
   perturbation schemes to simulate different production shifts. The feed
   under the first three perturbation schemes was applied in cycles of 16 h
   on and 8 It off, 12 h on and 12 h off, and 8 h on and 16 h off. The
   fourth scheme applied feed at 8 h on and 16 h off with no feed on
   weekends. The fifth scheme examined the long-term effect of substrate
   limitation using the 8 h on and 16 h off loading cycle with a feed
   interruption of 9 days. The organic loading per day was kept constant
   throughout the feed perturbation study. The reactor removed more than
   95\% of the dissolved organic carbon content of the waste under both
   continuous and cyclic loading. Formaldehyde removal rates of up to
   99.99\% were achieved under continuous loading while removal rates
   ranged from 97.4\% to 99.9\% under cyclic loading. Although the AFBGAC
   failed occasionally due to excessive buildup of attached biomass during
   the phase of continuous loading, it still maintained excellent overall
   removal efficiencies. It also showed resilience to substrate limitations
   and load perturbations under dynamic loadings. The results presented in
   this study provide a promising strategy to treat inhibitory wastes. (C)

Abstract = {{Acetylene (C(2)H(2)) inhibits key enzymes involved in nitrification
   (Ammonium monooxygenase) and denitrification (N(2)O reductases). Thus an
   injection of C(2)H(2) at mid time of a batch type incubation make it
   possible to assess denitrification by measurement of the N(2)O
   accumulation as well as nitrification, calculated from the variations of
   the ammonium flux. As estimated by the ``acetylene block technique{''},
   denitrification is known to be only a measure of the denitrification
   rate supported by nitrate diffusing from the water column (D(w)). This
   paper presents a first application on river epilithic biofilms which
   proved that the simultaneous measurement of D(w) and nitrification
   allows the estimation of the order of magnitude of total denitrification
   (D(t)) when nitrification is detected in the tested sample.
   This approach appears to be an easy tool for determination of
   nitrification and denitrification in natural samples and as thus
   presents an alternative to isotopic (15)N methods. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Water hydraulic systems use water instead of oil as a pressure medium.
   Microbial growth in the system may restrict the applicability this
   technology. The effects of fluid-flow velocity and water quality on
   microbial growth and biofilm formation were studied with a pilot-scale
   water hydraulic system. The fluid-flow velocities were 1.5-5.2 m/s and
   the corresponding shear stresses 9.1-84 N/m(2). The fluid-flow velocity
   had an insignificant effect on the total bacterial numbers and the
   numbers of viable heterotrophic bacteria in the pressure medium.
   Microbial attachment occurred under high shear stresses. The fluid-flow
   velocity did not affect the biofilm formation in the tank. Increase in
   the flow velocity decreased the bacterial densities on the pipe surfaces
   indicating preferable biofilm formation on areas with low flow velocity.
   Using ultrapure water as the pressure medium decreased the total cell
   numbers and resulted in slower growth of bacteria in the pressure
   medium. Lowering the nutrient concentration retarded biofilm formation
   but did not affect the final cell densities. The decreasing pressure
   medium nutrient concentration favoured microbial attachment in the tank
   instead of the pipelines. In conclusion, microbial growth and biofilm
   formation in water hydraulic systems cannot be controlled by the
   fluid-flow velocity or the quality of the pressure medium. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted at a wetland research facility,
   investigating the behavior and effects of chemically dispersed oil (CDO)
   using an oil-spill dispersant. The research site is located on the San
   Jacinto River near Houston, TX The replicated treatments included oiled
   control, ``high-dose{''} CDO (1:10 dispersant-to-oil ratio (DOR)),
   ``low-dose{''} CDO (1:20 DOR), as well as an unoiled control. Known
   amounts of oil or dispersed oil were added to the respective plots.
   Sediment samples were taken over a 99-day period using a 5-cm-diameter
   coring device. The GC/MS results for both ``total target saturate
   hydrocarbons{''} and ``total target aromatic hydrocarbons{''} were
   plotted over time and data were modeled using nonlinear regression. The
   overall (including abiotic and biotic) petroleum loss rates for the
   dispersed-oil treatments were not statistically different when compared
   to the oiled control. However, the initial concentrations for the
   dispersed-oil treatments were statically lower (95\% confidence) than
   for the oiled control. From this, it can be inferred that the dispersed
   oil was more prone to flush off the sediments, as was visually observed.
   Biodegradation rates were also determined for all treatments; it was
   concluded that there were no differences when comparing each
   dispersed-oil treatment to the oiled control. The sediments from each
   plot were also analyzed for microbial population numbers
   (most-probable-number) and acute toxicity (Microtox(R) 100\% Test).
   Statistical analyses for both sets of data found no significant
   differences for the dispersed-oil treatments when compared to the oiled
   control. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The disinfection by-product (DBP) reactivity (yield and speciation upon
   reaction with chlorine) of dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolated from
   two surface waters was investigated. The source waters, each having
   significantly different specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA(254)),
   Molecular weight (MW) distribution and polarity, were fractionated using
   XAD-8 resin adsorption and ultrafiltration (UF), with good DOM mass
   balance closures (based on dissolved organic carbon). It was found that
   such fractionation preserved both the SUVA and the reactivity of the
   source waters, as demonstrated by statistically similar DBP formation
   and speciation from chlorinated source water and source waters
   reconstituted from XAD-8 or UF fractions. In addition, there was no
   evidence of synergistic effects among DOM components when reacting with
   chlorine.
   Consistent trends between DBP yields and MW were not found. Hydrophobic
   fractions of DOM (isolated by XAD-8) were the most reactive DOM
   components; however, hydrophilic components also showed appreciable DBP
   yields, contributing up to 50\% of total DBP formation. In contrast,
   strong and unique correlations were observed between the SUVA of
   individual fractions and their trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid
   (HAA(9)) yields, confirming that the aromaticity of DOM components is
   more directly related to reactivity than other physicochemical
   properties. The finding of a single correlation independent of the
   fractionation process employed is notable because XAD-8 adsorption and
   UF fractionate DOM by significantly different mechanisms. These results
   confirm that SUVA is a distributed parameter that reflects DOM
   heterogeneity. Therefore, the SUVA distribution within natural water
   represents an important property that can be used as a reliable
   predictor of DBP formation. Finally, bromine appears to be more
   effectively incorporated into low UV-absorbing (i.e., low SUVA), low MW
   and hydrophilic DOM fractions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   describing flow field properties were obtained from a k - epsilon

Abstract = {{Since there are very limited numbers of thermophilic anaerobic digesters
   being operated, it is often difficult to start up a new one using sludge
   from an existing reactor as a seed. However, for obvious reasons it
   seems few attempts have been made to compare the start-up performance of
   thermophilic anaerobic digestion using different sources of seed
   sludges. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the start-up
   performance of anaerobic digestion using aerobic waste activated sludge
   (WAS) from a plant which has no anaerobic digesters and mesophilic
   anaerobic digested sludge (ADS) as the seed source at both mesophilic
   (35degreesC) and thermophilic (55degreesC) temperatures. In this study,
   two experiments were conducted. First, thermophilic anaerobic reactors
   were seeded with WAS (VSS = 4400 mg/L) and ADS (VSS = 14,500 mg/L) to
   investigate start-up performance with a feed of acetate as well as
   propionate. The results show that WAS started to produce CH4 soon after
   acetate feeding without a lag time, while ADS had a lag time of 10 days.
   When the feed was changed to propionate, WAS removed propionate down to
   below the detection limit of 10 mg/L, while ADS removed little
   propionate and produced little CH4. Second, in order to further compare
   the methanogenic activity of WAS and ADS, both mesophilic and
   thermophilic reactors were operated. WAS acclimated to anaerobic
   conditions shortly (<5 days at both mesophilic and thermophilic) and
   after acclimating it produced more CH4 per unit amount of seeded VSS
   than ADS. WAS at mesophilic temperature biodegraded acetate at the same
   rate as for thermophilic. However WAS at mesophilic temperature
   biodegraded propionate at a much faster rate than at thermophilic. WAS
   as the seed source of anaerobic digestion resulted in much better
   performance than ADS at both mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures
   for both acetate and propionate metabolism. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Transmission of pathogens with drinking water is a widespread problem,
   which affects not only the countries with low hygienic standards but the
   industrialized countries as well. The pathogens are excreted by man or
   animals and are picked up orally. Chlorination of drinking water has
   been introduced to the water supply in the beginning of the 19th century
   in order to stop the spreading of pathogens especially typhoid fever by
   drinking water. Despite the worldwide use of chlorine for disinfection
   of drinking water, water-mediated disease outbreaks occur again and
   again. Disinfection of drinking water with chlorine has undoubtedly
   contributed to the reduction of typhoid fever mortality. However, it
   must be clear that other factors play an important role in the mortality
   drop. Filtration of water is a long-known and very effective process for
   eliminating pathogens from the drinking water. Pathogens in particles
   cannot be killed sufficiently by a chemical disinfectant. Even small
   fecal particles have to be eliminated reliably from the water by
   filtration. Disinfection of drinking water cannot replace filtration.
   The disinfection should be used to minimize the residual risk due to the
   presence of pathogens in the water but cannot be used for bringing
   fecally contaminated water into a hygienically sound condition. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Using membrane processes we studied the improvement of the treatment of
   waste emulsified by mineral oils and alkylphenolethoxylate (APE) and
   investigated diatomaceous earth processing for comparison. A
   quantitative analysis of the mineral oils and APE using column
   chromatography was applied to assess these processes. Despite
   substantial rejection of the turbidity values of emulsified model waste,
   the percentages of mineral oil and APE rejections using microfiltration
   (MF) processes were 39-61\% and 16-19\%, respectively. In contrast, the
   ultrafiltration (UF) process could reject 97\% for the mineral oils and
   90\% for APE. The diatomaceous earth adsorption processes reduced the
   mineral oils 40-49\% and the APE, 8-14\%, and therefore were inferior to
   the UF process for waste treatment. The average fluxes of both the MF
   and UF membranes until the volume reduction factor (VRF) reached a value
   of 5 were almost the same in the range of 8 x 10(-6)-14 x 10(-6) m(3)

Abstract = {{Based upon circumstantial evidence linking elevated coliform bacteria
   counts in drinking water distribution systems with unlined cast iron
   pipe, it was hypothesized that adsorption of humic substances by iron
   oxide containing corrosion products (CPs) can stimulate and/or support
   biofilm development. Using porous media consisting of iron-oxide-coated
   glass beads (IOCBs) or actual iron CPs, experiments were performed to
   evaluate the effectiveness of different corrosion control and
   disinfection treatments in reducing biofilm when humic substances were
   the carbon source. Free chlorine was the most effective treatment in
   minimizing biofilm. Addition of phosphate alone did not significantly
   reduce biofilm using the CPs, but there was weak evidence it did using
   the IOCBs. The combination of free chlorine and phosphate was more
   effective at minimizing biofilm than free chlorine alone when Cps were
   the media. The presence of humic substances was a major factor when
   considering biofilm minimization based on results of experiments using
   both types of iron oxide media. The combination of humic substances and
   CPs led to an increase in biofilm biomass when free chlorine was not
   present, similar to conditions that could occur at distribution system
   dead-ends. Treatment to raise the pH to 9 did not reduce biofilm in
   experiments using both media, and actually increased biofilm in the
   experiment using CPs under the conditions tested. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An experimental mass transfer correlation was developed for
   trichloroethylene (TCE) pools dissolving in water-saturated porous
   media. A three-dimensional, bench-scale model aquifer previously
   designed by Chrysikopoulos et al. (Water Resour. Res. 36(7) (2000) 1687)
   was employed for collection of the experimental dissolution data. The
   unique aspect of the model aquifer design is the formation of a
   well-defined, circular TCE pool at the bottom of the model aquifer.
   Steady-state dissolved TCE concentrations at specific downstream
   locations within the aquifer were collected for each of the seven
   interstitial velocities considered in this study. For each interstitial
   velocity, a corresponding time invariant overall mass transfer
   coefficient was determined by fitting the experimental data to an
   analytical solution applicable to nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) pools
   (Water Resour. Res. 31(4) (1995) 1137). Subsequently, a correlation
   relating the time invariant overall Sherwood number to appropriate
   overall Peclet numbers was developed. Relatively good agreement between
   the newly developed correlation and experimental data was observed. (C)

Abstract = {{Sewers are typically a means of transporting wastewater to a treatment
   facility, with little biotransformation of the soluble polymeric organic
   matter by suspended biomass. In the interest of providing an effective
   pretreatment of wastewater in a sewer network, it is necessary to design
   an accurate tool simulating sewer conditions and introduce an
   appropriate biomass for macromolecular pollutant degradation. Such a
   model reactor was built using a tanks-in-series design and the
   degradation of a polysaccharide (starch) by Aspergillus niger MUCL 28817
   was studied. Starch degradation and the accumulation of intermediates
   (hydrolysis fragments) in the individual reactors were quantified under
   transient conditions, at a mean hydraulic residence time of 17h. Starch
   was degraded by 90\% in this reactor system and an accumulation of
   oligosaccharides with molecular weight lower than 1000 Da was observed.
   These results may be helpful in the development of wastewater treatment
   in sewers and in the alleviation of the burden on undersized wastewater
   treatment systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal coherence was assessed for 11 limnological variables-water
   temperature, oxygen, conductivity, alkalinity, pH, colour, calcium (Ca),
   iron, aluminium, total phosphorus and total nitrogen-between 28 boreal
   lakes in southern Finland for the winter ice-covered period, The lakes
   were mainly small (< 0.2 km(2)) and brown-coloured, and located within a
   circle of 10-km radius, A mean Pearson correlation coefficient for all
   lake pairs and variables averaged 0.37. Temporal coherence of variables
   across lake pairs was highest for conductivity, Ca, water temperature
   and alkalinity. The lake pairs with a direct surface water channel
   connection had a higher coherence than the lake pairs not connected by a
   stream. The size of the lake or catchment area had little effect on the
   coherence between the lakes. Temporal coherence was not strongly related
   to the difference in water colour (dystrophy) between the lakes.
   However, between polyhumic lakes (colour > 100 g Pt m(-3)) the coherence
   was generally higher than between less coloured lakes. Year-to-year
   variation in limnological characteristics could be partly explained by
   the variation in local weather. In March, water temperature and
   chemistry were infrequently related to winter weather, rather they
   correlated with the weather conditions of the previous autumn, while the
   ambient late winter weather seemed to have a stronger influence on lake
   conditions in April. Temporal variation in some variables was related to
   the atmospheric pressure changes over the North Atlantic (the North
   Atlantic Oscillation, NAO). Our results suggest that the potential
   effects of climatic change on lakes can be generalised regionally for
   brown-coloured dystrophic lakes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Systematic adsorption tests were carried out to determine the uptake of
   typical quaternary amines, dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide and
   hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide and a primary amine, dodecylamine
   hydrochloride by sepiolite. Bottle adsorption tests conducted with
   untreated, acid- and heat-activated sepiolites exhibit two distinct
   regions. The first stage is characterized by low rate and governed
   through an ion exchange process between ammonium ions and magnesium ions
   in the octahedral sheet. The second stage is ascribed to a combination
   of chain-chain interactions through Van der Waals forces and ion
   exchange process, Despite several-fold increases in surface areas upon
   activation, surprisingly no improvement in adsorption is observed. The
   observed differences are explained on the basis of partial collapse of
   the sepiolite crystal structure, the removal of zeolitic and bound
   waters and modification of the pore size distribution of sepiolite upon
   treatments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Raw wastewater is a potential carrier of pathogenic microorganisms and
   may pose a health risk when pathogenic microorganisms become aerosolized
   during aeration. Two different types of wastewater treatment plants were
   investigated. and the amounts of cultivable bacteria and fungi were
   measured in the emitted aerosols, Average concentrations of 17000 CFU
   m(-3) of mesophilic. 2100 CFU m(-3) of TSA-SB bacteria (bacteria
   associated with certain waterborne virulence factors), 1700 CFU m(-3) of
   mesophilic and 45 CFU m(-3) of thermotolerant fungi, were found in the
   aerosol emitted by the aeration tank of the activated sludge plant. In
   the aerosol of the fixed-film reactor 3000 CFU m(-3) mesophilic and 730
   CFU m(-3) TSA-SB bacteria, and 180 CFU m(-3) mesophilic and 14 CFU m(-3)
   thermotolerant fungi' were measured, The specific emissions per
   population equivalent between the two types of treatment plants differed
   by two orders of magnitude. The microbial flux based on the open water
   surface area of the two treatment plants was similar. The aerosolization
   ratios of cultivable bacteria (expressed as CFU m(-3) aerosol/m(-3)
   wastewater) ranged between 8.4 x 10(-11) and 4.9 x 10(-9). The
   aerosolization ratio of fungi was one to three orders of magnitude
   higher and a significant difference between the two types of treatment
   plants could be observed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Struvite (MgNH4PO4 . 6H(2)O) fouling was investigated to identify the
   impact supersaturation and material had on scaling rates. Tests were
   undertaken at three supersaturation ratios and with three different
   materials: stainless steel, teflon and acrylic, Impellers consisting of
   a clasp unit and two corrosion coupons that could be attached were used
   to mix centrate liquor and precipitation was initiated by the change in
   pH caused by degassing.
   Increasing the supersaturation ratio from 1.7 to 5.3 led to a doubling
   in the scaling rate of stainless-steel coupons. Experiments with acrylic
   and teflon coupons showed the influence of surface roughness upon
   scaling propensity. Coarsely roughened coupons following 40 h of mixing
   had a mass of 413 mg of struvite attached compared to smooth coupons
   that had a mass of 240 mg attached. Material did have an influence upon
   struvite fouling but this influence diminished with increasing surface
   roughness. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of pilot scale combined process of fluidized biofilm
   process, chemical coagulation and electrochemical oxidation for textile
   waste ater treatment was studied. In order to enhance biological
   treatment efficiency, two species of microbes, which can degrade textile
   wastewater pollutants efficiently, were isolated and applied to the
   system with supporting media. FeCl3 . 6H(2)O, pH 6 and 3.25 x 10(-3)
   mol/l were determined as optimal chemical coagulation condition and 25
   mM NaCl of electrolyte concentration, 2.1 mA/cm(2) of current density
   and 0.71/min of flow rate were chosen for the most efficient
   electrochemical oxidation at pilot scale treatment. The fluidized
   biofilm process showed 68.81 of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 54.5\%
   of color removal efficiency, even though using relatively low MLSS
   concentration and short sludge retention time. COD and color removals of
   95.4\% and 98.5\% were achieved by overall combined process. The
   contribution of fluidized biofilm process to the overall combined
   process was increased over 25.7\% of COD reduction and 20.5\% of color
   reduction by adopting support media in biological treatment, It can be
   thought that the fluidized biofilm process was effective, and pollutant
   loading on post-treatment was pretty much decreased by this system.
   This combined process was highly competitive in comparison to the other
   similar combined systems. It was concluded that this combined process
   was successfully employed and much effectively decreased pollutant
   loading on post-treatment for textile wastewater treatment at pilot
   scale. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional chemical data for spring and river waters are presented
   together with sulphur isotopic data for dissolved sulphate to elucidate
   the source of water salinisation in the middle section of the Llobregat
   River, As dilution processes do not affect sulphur isotopic composition,
   the analysis of delta(34)S of dissolved sulphate in waters provides an
   excellent tool for quantifying the environmental impact caused by the
   mining activity existing in the area.
   The delta(34)S of dissolved sulphate from mining effluents and saline
   springs unrelated to mining activity was analysed. The results obtained
   range from + 18parts per thousand to +20parts per thousand (VCDT) for
   mining effluents and from + 10parts per thousand to + 14parts per
   thousand (VCDT) for natural saline springs. These values are in
   accordance with the pattern of sulphur isotopic composition of sulphates
   from the evaporite materials of this area. This distinctive isotopic
   composition has allowed us to determine the origin of salinity in those
   cases in which chemical features are not conclusive. In addition, two
   fertilisers widely used in the studied area are chemically and
   isotopically characterised and their contribution to groundwater
   salinisation is assessed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The use of granular blast furnace slag (GBFS)-packed columns to treat
   lead-containing solutions has been investigated. The results obtained
   indicated that the slag usage rate decreased with increasing flow
   velocity, particle size, initial lead concentration and decreasing with
   bed height, Lead removed selectively in the presence of other heavy
   metal ions. High concentrations of sodium and especially calcium in the
   solutions impeded the uptake of lead. For 20 mg l(-1) lead concentration
   an empty bed contact time greater of 4 min provided to efficient use of
   the slag bed. Column pH was an important parameter to lead removal under
   dynamic conditions and reflected the influence of the investigated
   factors. During all runs lead breakthrough coincided with an abrupt drop
   in effluent pH. The apparent mechanisms of lead removal in GBFS column
   are sorption (ion exchange and adsorption) on the slag surface and
   precipitation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this investigation was to examine the effectiveness of
   a magnetic ion exchange resin (MIEX(R)) to enhance the coagulation of
   disinfection by-product precursors in nine surface waters, each
   representing a different element of the USEPA's 3 x 3 enhanced
   coagulation matrix. The effect of MIEX-pretreatment on the requisite
   alum dose needed for subsequent coagulation of turbidity was also
   evaluated.
   Enhanced coagulation with MIEX was found to be very effective for
   removing trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid (HAA) precursors from
   the nine waters examined. THM and HAA formation potential was reduced by
   more than 60\% in all of the waters studied; reductions approaching 90\%
   were seen in the waters with the highest specific ultraviolet absorbance
   values. The residual total organic carbon concentration, ultraviolet
   absorbance, and THM and HAA formation potential were all substantially
   lower as a result of MIEX and alum treatment compared to alum
   coagulation alone. MIEX pre-treatment also lowered the coagulant demand
   of each of the waters substantially. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Humic and fulvic acids extracted from landfill leachates were
   characterized using elemental analysis and various spectroscopic
   methods. Molecular size distribution of the humic substances (HS) was
   also determined using batch ultrafiltration technique and permeation
   coefficient model. The element analysis and spectral features obtained
   from UV/visible. IR, and H-1 and C-13 NMR showed that the aromatic
   character in the leachate HS was relatively lower than that of
   commercial humic acid (Aldrich Co.), and higher in the HS of older
   landfill leachate. Fluorescence spectra indicated that humic acids had a
   relatively higher content of condensed aromatic compounds than the
   fulvic acids obtained from the same Sources, and the spectrum of
   commercial humic acid showed that aromatic compounds may be present in a
   much more condensed and complex form. Molecular size distribution data
   revealed that the leachate humic acids contained a higher percentage of
   smaller molecules of < 10.000 D, compared with that of the commercial
   humic acid (45 similar to 49\% vs. 33\%), and molecular size of the
   leachate HS had a tendency to increase as landfill age increased. These
   results indicate that the HS from landfill leachates were in an early
   stage of humification, and the degree of humification increased as the
   landfilling age increased, which implies important information on
   various related researches, such as interactions of HA with pollutants
   in terrestrial environments, and optimization of leachate treatment
   processes with respect to landfill age. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Two invertebrate species (Hyalella curvispina and Palaemonetes
   argentinus) and one macrophyte (Egeria densa) from a naturally high
   nutrient content system (Pampean rivers of La Plata, Argentina) were
   evaluated for their potential use in situ assays aiming to assess
   changes in water quality, Invertebrates were individually placed in
   cylindrical chambers in polluted sections of rivers and in reference
   upstream sites. Mortality after 48 h was high in polluted and reduced in
   control sites. Mortality was also higher in situ assays than in
   laboratory static tests, Standard sections of the macrophyte were also
   deployed at the reference and control sites. Growth (7 days) in terms of
   mass increment (but not in length) was consistently reduced in polluted
   sites. Results of benthic invertebrate and periphitic algae survey's
   were consistent with the in situ tests: pollution resulted in a decrease
   in the number of taxa, taxa replacement and in changes in the value of
   the biotic indices Indice Biotico PAMPeano and Indice de Diatomeas
   Pampeano, indicating deterioration of water quality. In situ assays have
   a high potential as environmental tools in integrated approaches of

Abstract = {{Phenolic solutions were treated with hydrogen peroxide and horseradish
   peroxidase (HRP) resulting in more than 95\% removal of phenols within 3
   h. Toxic compounds were formed during the treatment of aqueous solutions
   of phenol, 2-chlorophenol, 4-chlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol and
   2-methylphenol. However, the toxicities of HRP-treated solutions
   decreased within 21 h after the completion of the enzymatic reaction,
   except in the case of 2-methylphenol. The process of detoxification was
   significantly accelerated upon the addition of hydrogen peroxide to the
   dephenolized solutions. Solutions that were treated in the presence of
   chitosan exhibited lower toxicities than solutions treated in its
   absence if they were allowed to incubate for an extended period of time.
   Treatment in the presence of polyethylene glycol resulted in
   significantly higher toxicities. The toxicity of treated solutions was
   dependent on the addition mode of HRP and hydrogen peroxide. Treated
   solutions were also completely detoxified following illumination with UV
   light. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to investigate the synergy involved in
   the sequential inactivation of C. parvum oocysts with ozone followed by
   free chlorine at 1-20degreesC. Primary ozone and free chlorine
   inactivation curves are characterized by an initial lag-phase, followed
   by one or two post-lag-phase segments, the first segment at a faster
   rate than the second, of pseudo-first-order inactivation. The kinetics
   of primary inactivation with ozone and free chlorine has a relatively
   strong temperature dependence, and vary both with oocyst lot and oocyst
   age. Synergy is observed for the sequential inactivation of C. parvum
   oocysts with ozone/free chlorine. Ozone pre-treatment results in the
   disappearance of the lag-phase and the occurrence of a secondary free
   chlorine inactivation curve with generally two pseudo-first-order
   segments, the first segment at a faster rate than the second. The
   kinetics of both secondary segments is significantly faster than the
   post-lag-phase rate of inactivation with free chlorine alone, The
   temperature dependence for both phases of the secondary free chlorine
   inactivation kinetics is weaker compared to that for primary
   inactivation with ozone or free chlorine. As a result, the level of
   synergy in sequential disinfection with ozone/free chlorine increases
   with decreasing temperature within the range relevant to drinking water
   utilities. Good agreement is found between the kinetics determined using
   the modified in-vitro excystation method of viability assessment and
   animal infectivity data recently reported in the literature for both
   primary inactivation with ozone, and sequential disinfection with
   ozone/free chlorine. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An electro-coagulation-flotation process has been developed for water
   treatment. This involved an electrolytic reactor with aluminium
   electrodes and a separation/flotation tank. The water to be treated
   passed through the reactor and was subjected to coagulation/flotation,
   by Al(III) ions dissolved from the electrodes, the resulting flocs
   floating after being captured by hydrogen gas bubbles generated at
   cathode surfaces. Apparent current efficiencies for Al dissolution as
   aqueous Al(III) species at pH 6.5 and 7.8 were greater than unity. This
   was due to additional reactions occurring in parallel with Al
   dissolution: oxygen reduction at anodes and cathodes and hydrogen
   evolution at cathodes resulting in net (i.e. oxidation + reduction)
   currents at both anodes and cathodes. The specific electrical energy
   consumption of the reactor for drinking water treatment was as low as 20
   kWh (kg Al)(1) for current densities of 10 20A m(-2). The water
   treatment performance of the electrocoagulation process kas found to be
   superior to that of conventional coagulation with aluminium sulphate for
   treating a model-coloured water, with 20\% more dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) being removed for the same Al(III) dose. However, for a lowland
   surface water sample, the two processes achieved a similar performance
   for DOC and UV-absorbance removal. In addition, an up-flow
   electrocoagulator configuration performed better than a horizontal flow
   configuration, with both bipolar and monopolar electrodes. (C) 2002

   nitrification in biofilters and laboratory scale in-situ denitrification}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{The slow leaching of nitrogen from solid waste in landfills, resulting
   in high concentrations of ammonia in the landfill leachate, may last for
   several decades. The removal of nitrogen from leachate is desirable as
   nitrogen can trigger eutrophication in lakes and rivers. In the present
   study. a low-cost nitrification-denitrification process was developed to
   reduce nitrogen load especially in leachates from small landfills.
   Nitrification was studied in laboratory and on-site pilot aerobic
   biofilters with waste materials as filter media (crushed brick in
   upflow,, filters and bulking agent of compost in a downflow filter)
   while denitrification was studied in a laboratory anoxic/anaerobic
   column filled with landfill waste. In the laboratory nitrification
   filters, start-up of nitrification took less than 3 weeks and over 90\%
   nitrification of leachate (NH4-N between 60 and 170mg N1(-1), COD
   between 230 and 1300 mg l(-1)) was obtained with loading rates between
   100 and 130 mgNH(4)-N l(-1) d at 25degreesC. In an on-site pilot study a
   level of nitrification of leachate (NH4-N between 160 and 270 mg Nl(-1),
   COD between 1300 and 1600 mgl(-1)) above 90\% was achieved in a crushed
   brick biofilter with a loading rate of 50 mg NH4-Nl(-1) d even at
   temperatures as low as 5-10degreesC. Ammonium concentrations in all
   biofilter effluents were usually below the detection limit. In the
   denitrification column, denitrification started within 2 weeks and total
   oxidised nitrogen in nitrified leachate (TON between 50 and 150 trig
   Nl(-1)) usually declined below the detection limit at 25 C, whereas some
   ammonium, probably originating from the landfill waste used in the
   column, was detected in the effluent. No adverse effect was observed on
   the methanation of waste in the denitrification column with a loading
   rate of 3.8 g TON-N/t-TSwaste d. In conclusion, nitrification in a

Abstract = {{The bacterial population in an H-2-dependent denitrification system was
   studied, The laboratory set-up was designed for the treatment of potable
   water and consisted of an electrochemical cell, where the water to be
   treated as enriched with H-2 prior to entering a bioreactor. Bioreactors
   (columns packed with granulated active carbon) were inoculated with
   denitrifying bacterial strains isolated from a previous reactor then
   sampled immediate after inoculation or after 1 or 3 months of continuous
   operation. Total number of the bacteria and numbers of each different
   strain were determined at various levels of the bioreactor. The strains
   present in the were identified as Ochrobactrum anthropi. Pseudomonas
   stutzeri, Paracoccus panthotrophus and Paracoccus denitrificans. Numbers
   of the latter declined markedly with time with the other three strains
   being responsible for nitrate removal. A correlation was found between
   the relative abundance of each strain and its specific denitrification
   activity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   each binary system the biomass affinity follows the acidic properties of

Abstract = {{In the presence of polymeric M {[}meso-tetra (4,4'-biphenybisulfony)
   phenlporphyrin] (PMTBPBSOPP, M = Co, Mn. Cu, Zn, Fe), the photocatalytic
   oxidative degradation of acridine orange (AO) was investigated under
   conditions of irradiation with high-pressure mercury lamp (HPML), iodine
   tungsten lamp (ITL) and natural sunlight (NSL). respectively, The
   results indicated that PCoTBPBSOPP had remarkable effects on
   photodegradation of AO under NSL irradiation. The experiments also
   proved that the photocatalytic degradation of AO in aqueous solutions
   could be enhanced when hydrogen peroxide 0.4 g/L was added. When the
   initial concentration of AO was 43.8 mg/L. the degradation and the
   decolorization rates of AO under HPML irradiation were LIP to 98\% and
   97\%, respectively. A number of factors affecting photocatalytic
   degradation effects, such as the initial concentration of AO, light
   sources, pH etc., were studied in detail. The experimental results
   confirmed that polymeric metalloporphyrins could fully decompose AO by
   using artificial light source such as HPML and ITL. moreover Could
   degrade AO rapidly under NSL in 3 h. Definitely. polymer of
   metalloporphyrins in the heterogeneous photocatalysis phase had a
   potential application in wastewater treatment by using NSL. (C) 2002

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Number = {{16}},

Abstract = {{In many applications, some parameters of the Activated Sludge Model No.
   2d (ASM2d) need calibration. Since ASM2d usually is overparameterized
   with respect to the available data, the subset of calibration parameters
   is not unique. In practice, calibration of ASM2d (and other ASMs) is
   often addressed by ad hoc selecting and tuning procedures. In this
   paper. a more systematic approach based on parameter identifiability
   analysis of parameter subsets is applied. The approach consists of a
   preliminary prior parameter analysis and a subsequent iterative
   parameter subset selection and tuning procedure. The former includes the
   choice of suitable prior parameter values and uncertainties and a
   pre-selection of parameters which are reasonably estimated from the data
   available. The latter is based on three diagnostic measures which are
   simple to calculate and easy to interpret. It is demonstrated as to how
   these measures can be used to identify the most important model
   parameters and to analyze their interdependencies. In addition. it is
   shown how these measures facilitate the analysis of the influence of
   fixed parameter values on parameter estimates. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Fly larva shells (FLS) are formed as a side product in the biological
   treatment of organic wastes. and chitin and chitosan produced from the
   FLS have been used as sorbents for heavy-metal ions, Sorbents are
   characterised by FT-IR measurements and pH-potentiometric titration and
   by determination of their surface area, and the content of main elements
   (C, N, P, S) and ashes. Free metal ions are sorbed best (up to 0.5 0.8
   mmol g(-1)) onto chitin and chitosan. The sorption ability for free
   metal ions of chitin decreases in the order Fe(III) > Cu(II) (Pb(II) >
   Zn(II), > Ni(II) > Mn(II) and that of chitosan decreases in the order
   Cu(II) > Mn(II) > Ni(II) > Zn(II) > Pb(II) > Fe(III). The complexed
   metal ions are sorbed by, the FLS up to 0.2-0.4 mmol g(-1). The sorption
   ability for metal ions and ligands depends on pH, concentration of
   complexed metal ions and the ligand species in the solution. Glycine has
   the retarding effect on the sorption of Ni(II) and Cu(II) ions, and EDTA
   enhances the Cu(II) ion sorption. Ni(II) and glycine sorption obeyed the
   Langmuir isotherm. The observed sorption data show the promising
   potentialities of the FLS for the heavy-metal removal from the
   solutions, containing strong complexing agents. Mechanisms for the
   removal of free and complexed metal ions by chitin. chitosan and the FLS
   have been discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The laboratory-scale ultrafiltration (UF) experiments were conducted to
   determine the effect of the presence of powdered activated carbon (PAC)
   on the UF process performance, in terms of flux decline and the
   possibilities of membranes cleaning during backwashing. Poly(vinylidene
   fluoride) membranes formed by the phase inversion technique were used in
   the UF experiments. A model solution was prepared as a mixture of humic
   acids (HA) and phenol in concentration of 10 and 1 mg l(-1),
   respectively. Commercial powdered activated carbons CWZ 11 and CWZ 30
   (Gryfskand Sp. z o. o., Hajnowka, Poland) were used as the adsorbents.
   PAC dosage was in the range of 10-100 mg PACl(-1). The process was
   carried out in the cross-flow system. It was found that PAC addition to
   the distilled water leads to a small drop in the permeate flux,
   regardless of PAC dose and its type. Although PAC particles are too
   large to block the membrane pores inside, they deposit on the membrane
   surface and partially can plug the surface pores. The experimental
   results demonstrate that the backwashing process applied in combined
   PAC/UF system was especially effective when PAC dosages were <22mg
   PACl(-1). However. a similar permeate flux was maintained for all carbon
   dosages used and reached the value of about 1 m(3) m(-2) d(-1).
   Moreover. no further drop in the permeate flux for PAC addition to the
   solution containing foulants (HA) was observed. Effectiveness of the
   removal of HA and phenol from the model solutions was also investigated.
   In the PAC/UF system HA were removed in about 90\%, whereas the complete
   removal of phenol was achieved for PAC dosage equal to 100 mg l(-1). (C)

Abstract = {{This study investigates the ozonation of 2-naphthalenesulfonate (2-NS)
   combined With ultraviolet (UV) radiation, Naphthalenesulfonic acids are
   of importance as dye intermediates for the dye and textile auxiliary
   industries. Its derivatives, such as 2-NS. have been found in rivers and
   tannery effluents causing Pollution problems. Thus, the 2-NS is of
   concern for the aquatic pollution control especially in the surface and
   waste waters. Ozonation combined with UV radiation is employed for the
   removal of 2-NS in the aqueous solution. Semibatch ozonation experiments
   were proceeded under different reaction conditions to studs the effects
   of ozone dosage and UV radiation on the oxidation of 2-NS. The
   concentrations of 2-NS and sulfate are analyzed at specified time
   internals to elucidate the decomposition of 2-NS. In addition, values of
   pH and oxidation reduction potential are continuously Measured in the
   course of experiments. Total organic carbon is chosen as a
   mineralization index of the ozonation of 2-NS, The mineralization of
   2-NS via the ozonation is remarkably enhanced by the UV radiation. These
   results can provide useful information for the proper removal of 2-NS in
   the aqueous solution by the ozonation with UV radiation. (C) 2002

   degradation and migration of different herbicides at trace levels in an
   aerobic aquifer at Vejen, Denmark. Mecoprop (MCPP) and dichlorprop
   monitored in a dense network of multilevel samplers were both degraded
   within a distance of I in after a period of 120 days, The study showed
   that no preferential degradation of the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of MCPP

Abstract = {{Oocysts of C. parvum have been associated with several waterborne
   outbreaks of gastro-enteric disease. Currently, one of the main barriers
   to oocyst contamination of drinking waters is provided by sand-bed
   filtration. In this study an atomic force microscope (AFM) has been used
   to measure the force of interaction between oocysts of C. parvum and a
   model sand surface (silicate glass). The AFM force curves have been
   compared and contrasted with the corresponding electrical potentials
   obtained from electrophoretic measurements (). It has been found that
   the surface of C. parvum oocysts possesses a hairy layer, most likely a
   result of surface proteins extending into solution. The hairy layer
   imposes a steric repulsion between the oocyst and sand surface, in
   addition to any electrostatic repulsion. The hairy layer collapsed to
   varying extents in the presence of dissolved calcium and dissolved
   organic carbon, indicating that the oocysts may be more readily adsorbed
   onto the model sand surface under these conditions. Conversely, as the
   two surfaces are pulled apart, the occasional attachment of oocyst
   surface proteins to the model sand surface can result in adhesion. The
   AFM results offer new insights into the oocyst surface of C. parvum, and
   the mechanism of interaction with model sand surfaces under conditions
   relevant to sand-bed filtration. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study investigates the effects of pulsed electric fields on the
   inactivation of trophozoite form of Naegleria lovaniensis Ar9M-1 in
   batch and flow processes, systematically examining the lethal effect of
   field strength, pulse duration, number of pulses, and pulse frequency.
   Our results show that amoebae eradication is modulated by pulse
   parameters, composition of the pulsing medium, and physiological state
   of the cells. Cell survival is not related to the energy delivered to
   the cell suspension during the electrical treatment. For a given energy
   a strong field applied for a short cumulative pulse duration affects
   viability more than a weak field with a long cumulative pulsation. We
   also determine the optimal electrical conditions to obtain an
   inactivation rate higher than 95\% while using the least energy. Flow
   processes allow to treat large-scale volumes. Our results show that the
   most efficient flow process for amoeba eradication requires a field
   parallel to the flow. Pulsed electric fields are a new and attractive
   method for inactivating amoebae in large volumes of fresh water. (C)

Abstract = {{A field-scale no-till corn plot (120 m x 90 m) located on a tile drained
   silt loam soil near Kintore, Ontario was irrigated with 2.5 cm of water
   over a 3 h period to examine the effects of irrigation on tile sediment
   transport in a headwater stream. Flow characteristics and the
   composition, concentration and size distribution of suspended solids
   were measured at the tile outlet, an upstream reference site and three
   sites located downstream of the tile drain. Results show that tile
   sediments at the study site are fine-grained (D-50 approximate to
   5.0mum) and consist primarily of quartz, anorthite/ albite, dolomite and
   calcite. Sediment concentrations in tile effluent increased from 8 to 57
   mg L-1 after 1.5h of irrigation and reached a maximum of 72mgL(-1). The
   sediment yield from the tile drain for the irrigation event was 4.6kg
   ha(-1). An unsteady, mobile boundary flow model (MOBED) was used to
   predict flow characteristics in the stream. According to the MOBED
   model, bed shear stress in the stream was approximately 6 N m(-2). This
   value is significantly greater than the critical shear stress for
   complete suspension of 1 N m-2 for tile sediments as determined from
   laboratory experiments using a rotating circular flume. Grain size
   distributions of suspended solids in the stream,were close to the
   dispersed size distribution because of the high shear stress in the
   receiving stream. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{The PCB contamination in lower Fox River sediments was investigated in
   order to identify possible PCB sources, contributions, and
   transformations, using two receptor models. Congener specific sediment
   PCB data from sites immediately upstream of DePere dam to Green Bay that
   had been gathered for the Green Bay/Fox River Mass Balance Study, were
   used in this analysis. The first receptor model is a self training
   factor analysis (FA) model with non-negative constraints that was
   applied to identify the PCB sources and significant congener patterns.
   The second is a chemical mass balance model (CMB) in which published
   Aroclor sources, inferred from our FA model, were used to apportion
   these Aroclors to each sample. The FA model indicated two significant
   factors, the major one being Aroclor 1242 and the other, a profile
   dominated by low chlorinated congeners, indicating a possible PCB
   alteration profile. This profile had significant contributions to
   samples at or around sites with total PCB concentrations higher than 50
   ppm, indicating a potential anaerobic dechlorination activity. It was
   also deduced from the FA model that very small contributions of more
   highly chlorinated Aroclors may be present in the system. The results
   from the CMB model confirmed that the system is dominated by Aroclor
   1242. Its average contribution was 95\%, with small amounts of Aroclor
   1254 (2\%) and 1260 (1\%). Two of the samples, located in the vicinity
   of point sources, showed high contributions of Aroclor 1016 by the CMB
   model. This is interpreted as an altered Aroclor profile resembling the
   less chlorinated Aroclor 1016. Contributions obtained. form the CMB and
   FA models show similar patterns. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study sought to examine the solubilization of mixtures of the
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in solutions of the nonionic
   surfactants: Tween 20, Tween 80, Triton X 100, Brij 35, and Brij 58.
   When pyrene (PYR), fluoranthene (FLA), and phenanthrene (PHE) were
   solubilized from two-PAH mixtures, the PAH concentrations and molar
   solubilization ratios deviated very little from those as found in the
   single-PAH systems. When these PAHs were solubilized from the three-PAH
   mixtures, however, not all three PAHs reached their single-PAH
   solubilities. When the PAHs were added sequentially to surfactant
   solution, the PAH added last reached its single-PAH solubility, while
   the concentration of other two PAHs were lowered by 14-45\%. When the
   PAHs were added simultaneously to the surfactant solution, the
   composition of the solid phase influenced which PAH reached its
   single-PAH solubility. For solids containing equal mole fractions of all
   three PAHs, FLA and PHE dissolved in surfactant solution to a lesser
   extent than the single-PAH systems. In similar systems containing no
   surfactant, only FLA solubility decreased. As the mole fraction of a PAH
   in the solid phase increased, its solubility in the micelle phase (and
   in the aqueous phase) increased up to the solubility limit. Based on
   these studies, both PAH-PAH interactions and micelle-PAH interactions
   should be taken into account when predicting the concentrations of PAH
   mixtures in micellar surfactant solutions. This should be done because
   PAH-PAH interactions can influence aqueous solubility, while micelle-PAH
   interactions can affect the distribution of PAHs in the micellar phase,
   which may change as the mixture composition changes. Published by

Abstract = {{Eighteen anaerobic/aerobic batch experiments were conducted with a
   variety of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) on a sequencing batch reactor
   (SBR) population displaying enhanced biological phosphorus removal
   (EBPR). A statistically significant (P<0.01 for all variables)
   correlation between aerobic phosphorus uptake and polyhydroxyalkanoates
   (PHAs) quantity and form was observed. The results suggest that
   poly-3-hydroxy-butyrate (3HB) results in significantly higher aerobic
   phosphorus (P) uptake per unit mmoles as carbon (mmoles-C) than
   poly-3-hydroxy-valerate (3HV). The results showed that acetic and
   isovaleric acids resulted in higher P removals (relative to propionic
   and valeric acids) during EBPR batch experiments not because of higher
   PHAs quantity, but largely because the predominant type was 3HB rather
   than 3HV. In contrast propionic and valeric acids resulted in 3HV, and
   showed much lower aerobic P uptake per unit PHAs. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Free chlorine decay rates in water distribution systems for bulk and
   wall demands should be modelled separately as they have different
   functional dependencies. Few good quality determinations of in situ wall
   demand have been made due to the difficulty of monitoring live systems
   and due to their complexity. Wall demands have been calculated from
   field measurements at 11 locations in a distribution system fed from a
   single source. A methodology for the laboratory determination has been
   evolved and shown to give results that are similar to the in situ
   results. Pipe materials were classified as either having high reactivity
   (unlined iron mains) or low reactivity (PVC, MDPE and cement-lined
   ductile iron). The results indicate that wall decay rates for the former
   are limited by chlorine transport and for the latter by pipe material
   characteristics. The wall decay rate is inversely related to initial
   chlorine concentration for low reactivity pipes. In general, water
   velocity increases wall decay rates though the statistical confidence is
   low for low reactivity pipes. A moderate biofilm coating did not
   influence the wall decay rate for low reactivity pipes. (C) 2002

Title = {{Treatment of domestic wastewater using the nutrient film technique (NFT)
   to produce horticultural roses}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{3489-3496}},

Abstract = {{Removal of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus was investigated in a
   pilot based on the nutrient film technique system used for horticultural
   production. Rosebushes producing commercial roses were set on an
   inclined impermeable surface over which a thin film of domestic
   wastewater flowed directly through the root matrix. The roses produced
   with wastewater as nutrient solution were qualitatively and
   quantitatively similar to those produced traditionally and can be
   marketable.
   In the presence of the rosebushes, the lowering of chemical oxygen
   demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD5) and suspended solids (SS)
   increased with their influent strengths in a linear fashion correlation.
   Whatever the pollutant load of the influent, within the range studied,
   the level of organic pollution required to allow the discharge of the
   effluent into water courses was reached after 24 h of treatment. At this
   time, the COD reached 39 +/- 13 mg L-1, the BOD5 7 +/- 4 mg L-1 and the
   SS 8 +/- 6mg L-1. The removal percentages were 89, 95 and 94,
   respectively, whereas without plants they were 55, 33 and 53,
   respectively. The rosebushes had a beneficial effect on the removal of
   phosphorus from 20\% to 23\% greater in their presence than without. In
   presence of plants, the nitrate was the principal form of nitrogen from
   48 h of treatment whereas without rosebushes, nitrite represent more
   than 20\% of initial nitrogen whatever the treatment duration. The root
   matrix served not only as a filter for the organic matter, but also
   provided a microhabitat suitable for nitrifying bacteria and
   heterotrophic micro-organisms, which responded rapidly to the pollutant
   load. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel in situ membrane technology was developed to remove nitrate

   electron donor to stimulate denitrification. A flow-through reactor fit
   with six hollow-fiber membranes (surface area= 93cm(2)) was designed, to
   simulate groundwater flowing through an aquifer with a velocity of 0.3
   m/day. This membrane technology supported excellent NO3- and nitrite
   (NO2-) removal once H-2 and carbon limitations were corrected. The
   membrane module achieved a maximum H-2 flux of 1.79 x 10(-2) mg H-2/m(2)
   s, which was sufficient to completely remove 16.4 mg/L NO3--N from a
   synthetic groundwater with no NO2- accumulation. In addition, this model
   in situ treatment process produced a high quality water containing < 0.5
   mg/L total organic carbon. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Removal of fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci was monitored over a
   period of 13 months in 14 buried pilot scale filters, treating septic
   tank effluent. The effects of grain size, hydraulic dosing rate and
   distribution method were investigated. Two different natural sands
   (sorted sand and unsorted sand) and three different types of light
   weight aggregates (LWA 0-4 mm, LWA 2-4 mm and crushed LWA 0-3 mm) were
   used. Intermittent dosing rates from 20 to 80 mm/day in 12 doses per day
   were applied to the filters by uniform pressure distribution or point
   application by gravity dosing. Removal of fecal coliforms was more than
   three orders of magnitude higher in the media with the finest grain
   sizes (unsorted sand) as compared to the coarsest media (LWA 0-1 mm and
   LWA 2-4 mm) operated under same conditions. Fecal streptococci were
   determined only in effluent from filters with LWA 0-4 mm and LWA 2-4 mm.
   Higher removal of fecal coliforms was observed in pressure dosed filters
   compared to gravity dosed filters. A lower removal was observed by
   increasing the hydraulic dosing rate. Minimum retention time was found
   to be a key parameter for predicting removal of bacteria in unsaturated,
   aerobic filters. At minimum retention times lower than about 50h, there
   was a correlation of 0.96 between retention time and removal of fecal
   coliforms. Retention times longer than 50 h gave almost complete removal
   of fecal coliforms. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation of refractory chemicals in water requires chemical
   oxidation by hydroxyl radicals. Among the systems that may be used to
   generate OHdegrees, the Fenton's reagent consists of the mixing of
   ferrous iron and hydrogen peroxide. Even though this system is very
   simple, the oxidation of an organic compound is difficult to control and
   the ferrous iron regeneration is limited. Very recently, electrochemical
   systems have merged that allow the electrochemical production of ferrous
   iron and/or hydrogen peroxide, thereby allowing the generation of
   OHdegrees. So a simple electro-Fenton system has been used and tested
   for its efficiency in producing hydroxyl radicals. Atrazine was chosen
   as a model organic compound as its reaction with OHdegrees has been
   extensively studied. Comparison with the classical Fenton system gives
   advantage to the electrochemical system, due to a more thorough
   oxidation of atrazine. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of biofilm
   and natural organic matter (NOM) on removal of Cryptosporidium parvum
   oocysts from water by filtration. The bench-scale rapid filters
   consisted of 2.54 cm ID x 30.5 cm polycarbonate. plastic columns packed
   with 0.55 mm spherical glass beads to a depth of 25 cm and a porosity of
   40\%. Calcium chloride (0.01 M) served as the coagulant in most of the
   experiments. The oocyst removal efficiency decreased from 51 +/- 6\% for
   a clean bed to 23 +/- 3\% for the biofilm-coated bed and to 14 +/- 1 \%
   in the presence of 5 ppm of NOM. The oocyst removal for an experiment
   with a combination of biofilm-coated filter media and NOM was similar to
   that for the experiment with NOM alone (15 +/- 1\%). The zeta potential
   values for the oocysts pre-equilibrated with NOM were significantly more
   negative than those obtained for untreated oocysts. This suggests that
   NOM enhanced the electrostatic repulsion between the oocysts and the
   negatively charged glass beads. Fortunately, use of alum as coagulant at
   a dosage sufficient to neutralize the surface charge of the NOM-coated
   oocysts resulted in a high removal efficiency (73 6\%).
   Pre-equilibration of the oocysts with NOM also increased the
   hydrophobicity of the oocysts, but this was deemed to have a negligible
   effect on deposition onto the glass beads. The results of these
   experiments suggest that water treatment facilities treating source
   waters with moderate organic matter concentrations and/or employing
   biologically active filters have a greater potential for oocyst
   breakthrough and proper coagulation is critical for effective removal of
   oocysts in the filters. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A new hollow-fiber membrane remediation system has recently been
   developed to passively supply groundwater with dissolved hydrogen (H-2)
   to stimulate the biodegradation of chlorinated solvents. Understanding
   the mass transfer behavior of membranes under conditions of creeping
   flow is critical for the design of such systems. Therefore, the
   objectives of this research were to evaluate the gas transfer behavior
   of hollow-fiber membranes under conditions typical of groundwater flow
   and to assess the effect of membrane configuration on gas transfer
   performance. Membrane gas transfer was evaluated using laboratory-scale
   glass columns operated at low flow velocities (8.6-12,973 cm/d). H-2 was
   supplied to the inside of the membrane fibers while water flowed on the
   outside and normal to the fibers (i.e. crossflow). Membrane
   configuration (single fiber and fabric) and membrane spacing for the
   fabric modules did not affect gas transfer performance. Therefore, the
   results from all of the experiments were combined to obtain the
   following dimensionless Sherwood number (Sh) correlation expressed as a
   function of Reynolds number (Re) and Schmidt number (Sc): Sh =
   0.824Re(0.39) SC0.33 (0.0004 < Re < 0.6). This correlation is useful for
   predicting the rate of transfer of any gas from clean membranes to
   flowing water at low Re. This correlation provides a basis for
   estimating the membrane surface area requirements for groundwater
   remediation as illustrated by a simple example. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The temperature-dependent aqueous solubilities of 12 non-ortho and
   mono-ortho coplanar PCBs (IUPAC Nos. 77, 81, 105, 114, 118, 123, 126,
   156, 157, 167, 169, and 189) were determined at 5 C, 15 C, 25 C, and 35
   C. A generatorcolumn/extractor-column technique was used, followed by
   off-line GC/ECD analysis. The relative standard deviations for the
   measurements were less than or equal to 7.4\%. The determined
   solubilities increase exponentially with temperature from 5 C to 35 C
   for all 12 tested PCBs, and their enthalpies of solution were determined
   to range from 22.3 to 45.0 kJ/mol. The determined solubilities of PCB 77
   at 25degreesC were further compared with the results reported previously
   and with the calculated data. Within homolog groups, congeners with more
   ortho-substitution generally have greater aqueous solubilities. The
   measured aqueous solubilities of 58 congeners compiled from the
   literature and from this study were used for evaluation of quantitative
   structure-property relationships relating chlorine substitution pattern
   to the aqueous solubilities. A useful equation by which to estimate
   aqueous solubilities was derived on the basis of multi-regression
   analysis, which employs easily calculable molecular descriptors. The
   validity of this equation is demonstrated by comparison of the estimated
   values with experimental values. This newly developed model agrees well
   with log K-ow(-); based model predictions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The complete mineralization of concentrated solutions of Diclofenac
   (2-{[}(2,6-dichlorophenyl) amino] benzene-acetic acid) sodium salt
   C14H10Cl2NO2Na was carried out in a concentric cylindrical immersion
   photoreactor in batch mode operation. Irradiation with a lamp emitting
   light at 254 nn (400 W) achieved total mineralization of Diclofenac
   solutions (0.062 mM or TOC 20 mgCl(-1)) in times under an hour. The
   mineralization was carried out via Fenton photo-assisted treatment. A
   determination of the solution parameters was carried out to optimize the
   time of the Diclofenac pretreatment, the type and intensity of the light
   source, the effect of the concentrations of Fe-ions and the oxidant
   added in solution and the reactor recirculation rate. Diclofenac
   disappearance was monitored by high liquid pressure chromatography
   (HPLC). Concomitantly, the aromatic and aliphatic intermediates were
   also monitored under low-energy (36 W) light irradiation at 366 nm in
   order to be able to detect the intermediates by HPLC in the minute time
   scale. The decrease of the chemical oxygen demand was followed during
   Diclofenac degradation. The activation energy for the mineralization of
   Diclofenac was determined to be 4.02 Kcal mol(-1). (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In the present paper, a systematic study of the influence of raw water
   quality and operating conditions on the effectiveness of the
   coagulation-flocculation process using aluminium sulphate (AS) is
   presented. The influence of raw water composition is studied at two
   levels, fractional factorial designs and a Doehlert uniform shell design
   to determine the influence of the operating conditions. The analysis of
   the experimental responses (residual turbidity and minimally AS dose are
   denoted as (Tu(m)) and (AS(m)), respectively) shows that the parameters
   which have the greatest influence change depending on the response. It
   is not always possible, for a given water composition, to obtain
   simultaneously low residual turbidity and minimally AS dose. However,
   under the conditions of this study, the search for a criterion of
   optimisation must bear the minimisatiori of residual turbidity, because
   it remains the principal criterion of effectiveness of the process,
   even, if in a few cases, it results in an increase in the cost of
   treatment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum-silicate polymer composite (PASiC), a new kind of inorganic
   coagulant, was produced by two approaches: (1) hydroxylation of the
   mixture of AlCl3 and fresh polysilicate (PASiCc); (2) hydroxylated
   polyaluminum-chloride (PAC) combined with fresh polysilicate (PASiCm).
   The PASiC products had the following properties: Al2O3 content =
   6.40-7.30\%, SiO2 content = 0.40-0.82\%, Al/Si ratios =10-20, basicity
   (OH/Al molar ratio, denoted B) = 1.2-2.0. The coagulation behaviour of
   PASiC and PAC under conditions typical for coagulation and flocculation
   in water treatment were investigated by studying the rate of floc size
   development, the variety of streaming current value, the efficiency of
   turbidity removal and the effect of pH on the turbidity removal
   efficiency, and the stability of PASiC. The results detailed in this
   study suggest that, compared with PAC, PASiC may enhance aggregating
   efficiency and give better coagulating effects, but weaken charge
   effectiveness in coagulation process or become unstable when stored for
   longer time, especially at higher B value and lower Al/Si ratio. The
   coagulating effect of PASiC is closely linked to the preparation
   procedure. With the increase of B value and the decrease of Al/Si ratio,
   the coagulation efficiency of PASiC increases, and at the same B value
   and Al/Si ratio, PASiCc seems to give a little better coagulation effect
   than PASiCm but less stability. The Al/Si ratio should not be too low or
   the B value should not be too high, otherwise, the PASiC products tend
   to become cloudy or partly gelatinous, which will make them loss some
   coagulation efficiency. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The applicability of H2O2 to increase the efficiency of TiO2
   photocatalytic degradations was investigated. The photographic developer
   metol {[}N-methyl p-aminophenol] that does not adsorb on the surface of
   TiO2 particulates was used as a model for this purpose. It was proved
   that metol was mineralised under oxidation with H2O2/TiO2/UV through
   different thermal and photochemical reactions. Identification of
   intermediates by both HPLC-electron impactMS and HPLC-electrospray
   ionisation-MS helped to elucidate the role of H2O2 and
   TiO2\textbackslash{},! in the degradation process and to establish
   degradation pathways. Intermediates yielded were partially oxygenated
   aromatic species and dimers, which were amenable to oxidation. The
   optimal degradation conditions found for mineralisation were 0.4 M H2O2,
   5 mg/ml TiO2, pH 9 and irradiation centred at 360 nm (4.9 mW/cm(2)). The
   use of oxidants opens an interesting medium to the treatment of
   effluents containing a diversity of organics since they increase
   substantially the efficiency of TiO2 photocatalytic degradations. (C)

Abstract = {{The ability of submerged macrophytes to moderate the structure of food
   webs with respect to lake eutrophication management has been intensively
   studied in recent years. Many lake managers have adopted the option of
   increasing macrophyte abundance in order to restore eutrophic waters,
   with a view to improve water quality, increase water transparency and
   reduce phytoplankton biomass. These studies are mostly based upon the
   comparison of macrophyterich and macrophyte-free waters. There is less
   quantitative information on how different levels of macrophyte
   abundance, in particular very low levels, influence ecosystem structure,
   or vice versa, within the same ecosystem. This paper takes a
   multivariate statistical approach to examine ecosystem function with low
   macrophyte abundance (ca. 5\%) in the context of
   nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton interaction in a eutrophic shallow
   lake. It shows that with low levels of macrophyte coverage,
   phytoplankton biomass was only limited by nutrient (TP and Si)
   availability, whilst nutrient (Si) as well as grazing (zooplankton and
   Daphnia) factors were both limiting phytoplankton levels in
   macrophyte-free waters. With respect to interactions between Daphnia and
   chlorophyll-a, the results suggest that low macrophyte cover does not
   result in a reduction of phytoplankton biomass due to the presence of
   Daphnia. Rather, low macrophyte cover provides a refuge that maintains
   constant Daphnia predation, so reducing chlorophyll-a fluctuation. These
   results add credence to the causal interpretation of different
   interactions amongst nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton at very
   low macrophyte densities. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Diversity and trophic indices based on macrophyte communities were
   calculated to test their pertinence to monitoring water quality in the

   and abundance and richness. Trophic indices and McIntosh's index
   appeared to be more effective in predicting water quality than diversity

   feed (1.4-4.3 cm(3)/s), organic (1.24.1 cm(3)/s), and stripping phases
   (1.4-4.3 cm(3)/s), and temperatures (298-318K). It was shown that the
   extraction rate increased with decreasing feed phase flow rate, but the
   effect of flow rates of organic and stripping phases was not pronounced
   under the ranges studied. Mechanism of the mass transfer at each step
   was discussed and the effect of mutual interaction of the two
   extractants in the organic phase was also examined. The application

Abstract = {{The organic composition of the feed sludge to six laboratory-scale
   anaerobic digesters was adjusted by substituting a proportion of the
   primary sludge for glucose or propionic acid solution. Substitution with
   glucose caused an increase in the microbial extracellular polymer (ECP)
   content of the digested sludge, which altered the particle size
   distribution of the sludge and made the sludge more difficult to
   dewater. Substitution with propionic acid gave similar results to the
   control. The relationship between the digested sludge extracted ECP
   yield and sludge filtrability determined using the capillary suction
   time test was significant at the P = 0.01 level. The level of ECP for
   optimum sludge dewaterability was calculated as 17.2 mg g(-1) SS. The
   protein and carbohydrate composition of the extracted polymer did not
   appear to affect the sludge dewaterability. Results present will allow
   predictions to be made into the effect that changes in the influent
   sewage composition has on essential downstream processes. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that bacteriophages can provide useful information
   about the pathogenic microorganisms, particularly enteric viruses,
   present in water. This information is complementary to that obtained
   from bacterial indicators of faecal contamination, which would be of
   great value for evaluating the risks associated with the use of certain
   types of water. Before bacteriophages can be used as indicators of
   faecal contamination, we need to confirm that bacteriophages give a
   different response to that given by the well-known bacteria indicators
   and to determine what happens to bacteriophages in river water. Indeed,
   drinking water is often produced from river water, either by natural
   filtration through the soil or after undergoing various treatments. We
   collected 96 river water samples from six different sites between
   February and November 2000. The samples were analysed for three faecal
   indicator bacteria (thermotolerant coliforms, enterococci and spores of
   sulphite-reducing anaerobes) and three types of bacteriophages (somatic
   coliphages, F-specific phages and Bacteroides fragilis phages). The
   densities of thermotolerant coliforms and enterococci depended mainly on
   physical factors such as flow rate and water temperature. High
   temperature and low flow rate led to a decrease in the density of these
   microorganisms, especially in the absence of a major input of faecal
   pollution. Conversely, the densities of somatic coliphages, F-specific
   phages and spores of sulphite-reducing anaerobes remained constant
   regardless of the flow rate and temperature. The density of Bacteroides
   fragilis phages was too low for unambiguous determination of their fate
   in river water. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of the fuel oxygenate methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in
   the environment has received considerable scientific attention. The
   pollutant is frequently found in the groundwater due to leaking of
   underground storage tanks or pipelines. Concentrations of more than
   several mg/L MTBE were detected in groundwater at several places in the
   US and Germany in the last few years. In situ chemical oxidation is a
   promising treatment method for MTBE-contaminated plumes. This research
   investigated the reaction kinetics for the oxidation of MTBE by
   permanganate. Batch tests demonstrated that the oxidation of MTBE by
   permanganate is second order overall and first order individually with
   respect to permanganate and MTBE. The second-order rate constant was
   1.426 x 10(-6) L/mg/h. The influence of pH on the reaction rate was
   demonstrated to have no significant effect. However, the rate of MTBE
   oxidation by potassium permanganate is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower
   than of other advanced oxidation processes. The slower rates of MTBE
   oxidation by permanganate limit the applicability of this process for
   rapid MTBE cleanup strategies. However, permanganate oxidation of MTBE
   has potential for passive oxidation risk management strategies. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The biological degradation of perchlorate was examined using a

   was operated in unsaturated-flow mode and continuously fed water
   containing perchlorate (ClO4-) (as an electron acceptor), and a gas
   mixture of hydrogen (5\%) and carbon dioxide at a retention time of 1.5
   min. In the absence of nitrate, perchlorate removal rate (r(P), ppb/min)
   in the reactor was found to be first order with respect to perchlorate
   concentration (c, ppb) according to r(P) = 0.16 +/- 0.06c(0.97 +/- 0.12)
   (n = 11, R-2 = 0.97, p < 10(-5)). Perchlorate removal rates in the
   hydrogen feed were found to be comparable to rates found by others for
   fixed film bioreactors using either hydrogen gas or organic electron
   donors such as acetate, although the rate coefficient was reduced to
   slightly less than unity (r(P) = 0.22 +/- 0.08c(0.91 +/- 0-08) ; n = 19,
   R-2 = 0.89, p < 10(-5)). When nitrate was present in the water, similar
   perchlorate removals were achieved despite nitrate concentrations three
   orders of magnitude higher than perchlorate concentrations. Perchlorate
   was removed by an average of 25 + 5\% from a perchlorate-contaminated
   groundwater containing 73 +/- 2ppb of perchlorate and 21 +/- 2 ppm of
   nitrate. This removal was slightly higher than the removal of 17 +/- 3\%
   measured for a synthetic groundwater containing 79 + 3 ppb of
   perchlorate and 22 +/- 2ppm of nitrate. In both cases, there was an
   average of 10\% nitrate removal. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Short-term effects of metal pollution were assessed by transferring
   periphytic diatom communities developed on artificial substrates from a
   reference site to a site polluted by heavy metals (around 15 mug Cd L-1
   and 800 ug Zn L-1), located in neighbouring streams. Metal sensitivity
   of mature assemblages (aged 1 month;) was evaluated by studying changes
   in diatom density and taxonomic composition 2 and 4 weeks after the
   transfer. Resident communities of both sites were simultaneously
   collected on similar artificial substrates, in order to compare
   short-term effects of metals within transferred communities with
   long-term effects observed at the polluted site. Field transfer induced
   a marked shift of community structure towards that of the resident
   community of the polluted site: diatom density rapidly decreased after
   the transfer, from 35,000 +/- 4000 to 15,000 +/- 300 cells cm(-2) after
   2 weeks, and taxonomic composition changed. Relative abundances of
   species characteristic of the reference site rapidly decreased, e.g.
   Nitzschia dissipata and Gomphoneis minuta, whereas species
   characteristic of the polluted site progressively increased within
   transferred communities, e.g. Gomphonema parvulum, Pinnularia sp. or
   Fragilaria crotonensis. The structure of periphytic diatom communities
   could therefore be an indicator of metal pollution, with marked
   taxonomic changes being identified within reference assemblages after
   only 2 weeks under relatively low metal exposure. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The decomposition of trihaloacetic acids {[}bromodichloroacetic acid
   (BDCAA), dibromochloroacetic acid (DBCAA), tribromoacetic acid (TBAA)],
   and the formation of the corresponding trihalomethanes
   {[}bromodichloromethane (BDCM), dibromochloromethane (DBCM),
   tribromomethane (TBM)] were studied. Like TBAA, the two mixed
   chlorobromo-species, BDCAA and DBCAA, were found to decompose to form
   BDCM and DBCM, respectively, via a decarboxylation pathway. The
   decomposition of BDCAA, DBCAA and TBAA in water at neutral pH follows a
   first order reaction, with rate constants of 0.0011, 0.0062 and 0.040
   day(-1) at 23degreesC, respectively; and 0.000028, 0.00014 and 0.0016
   day(-1) at 4degreesC, respectively. The activation energies for the
   decomposition reaction of BDCAA, DBCAA and TBAA in water at neutral pH
   were found to be 35.0, 34.5 and 29.2 kcal/mol, respectively. The effect
   of pH in the range of 6-9 and the effect of a drinking water matrix on
   the decomposition of BDCAA, DBCAA, and TBAA in water were found to be
   insignificant. Measurement and health implications due to decomposition
   of trihaloacetic acids and formation of the corresponding
   trihalomethanes were discussed. By applying the technique of
   quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), the decomposition
   rate constants of six iodinated trihaloacetic acids were estimated. (C)

Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2931-2940}},

Abstract = {{The presence of micron-sized primary particles is critical in many
   solid/liquid separation processes, and characterisation of stability
   with respect to the degree of dispersion is therefore relevant.
   Characterisation of floc strength so far has mainly dealt with the size
   of floes and not addressed quantification with respect to primary
   particles. In the present work floc strength was quantified in terms of
   the shear sensitivity (k(SS)) as a standardised parameter based on the
   recent adhesion-erosion model (AE-model). The shear sensitivity
   quantifies the degree of dispersion for low total solids contents and
   intermediate turbulent shear rates. It reflects the affinity of
   adhesion/erosion of primary particles to and from floes and thus
   provides a means of characterising the interaction energy between the
   sludge colloids. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Coimmobilization of the freshwater microalga Chlorella vulgaris in
   alginate beads with the microalgae growth-promoting bacterium
   Azospirillum brasilense under semi-continuous synthetic wastewater
   culture conditions significantly increased the removal of ammonium and
   soluble phosphorus ions compared to immobilization of the microalgae
   alone. In continuous or batch cultures removal of these ions followed a
   similar trend but was less efficient than in semi-continuous culture. It
   is proposed that coimmobilization of a microalgae with microalgae

Abstract = {{One-dimensional settling models based on the conservation law calculate
   the flux of particles via discrete horizontal layers. Commonly at least
   10 of these spatial elements with constant volume are considered in
   order to achieve a satisfying fit with data. This paper deals with a
   conceptual approach of a simplified layer model, its theoretical
   confirmation and its applicability. The model differs three layers with
   variable volume-clarification-, hindered settling- and compression
   zone-which are not derived from numerical requirements but from the
   basic principles of solids flux theory for batch sedimentation. In
   accordance to the three types of propagation velocities of solids flux
   theory-hindered settling, signal speed and propagation of concentration
   discontinuities-three density layers of settling particles of a
   suspension have been defined. Model development has focused on a
   reduction of model complexity for on-line control purpose and for
   coupling with a biokinetic model. Another intention was the model's
   universal applicability to both batch and continuous settling in order
   to compare different types of activated sludge strategies. The model has
   been evaluated against the analytical solution of the flux function and
   against data from full-scale SBR experiments and from a secondary
   clarifier under hydraulic overload. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The degradation of methamidophos in pure bi-distilled water (with
   initial concentration 5 mg L-1, pH = 7 at the beginning) was studied.
   For the first time, 2 ionised air water treatment pilot systems (IAPS-1,
   -2, no additives) were set up (Figs. I and 2). The degradation of
   methamidophos was carried out with only the IAPS-2 and with two
   different ultraviolet (UV) lamps: high- and low-pressure mercury lamps
   (HP and LP, with or without H2O2). The kinetics of these oxidative
   processes was investigated. The highest rate constant was reached by the
   LP, 0.2\% H2O2 (k = 0.7524 min(-1), t(1/2) = 0.9 min), followed closely
   by both treatments with the HP, 0.2\% H2O2 (k = 0.6328 min(-1), t(1/2) =
   1.1 min) and LP, 0\% H2O2 (k = 0.4749 min(-1), t(1/2) = 1.5 min). The
   lowest rate constants were achieved from the HP, 0\% H2O2 process (k =
   0.0303 min(-1), t(1/2) = 22.9 min) and from the IAPS-2 (k = 0.0117
   min(-1), t(1/2) = 59.2 min). The mineralisation of methamidophos was
   confirmed by the determination of the anions produced including NO3-,
   PO43- and SO42- during and at the end of each experiment. The toxicity
   of water samples before, during and after the experiments was tested
   with Daphnia test. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Five bottled mineral waters from the Radenska and the Rogaska springs
   (Slovenia) were analyzed for their inorganic arsenic species As(III) and
   As(V) using existing speciation procedures. Both a hyphenated technique
   (HPLC-HGAFS) and a more conventional technique based on selective
   coprecipitation of As(III) with dibenzyldithiocarbamate prior to arsenic
   analysis (FI-HGAFS) were used. The techniques yielded data which were
   not significantly different on the 5\% level, with HPLC-HGAFS to be the
   least sensitive (DL 1 mug l(-1)) and the selective coprecipitation
   technique to be suitable for sub mug l(-1) levels (DL 0.05 mug l(-1)).
   The latter technique showed recoveries of 96.4 +/- 0.4\%. In none of the
   mineral waters As(III) was found whereas the Radenska minerals waters
   (vrelec Radin, vrelec Miral, Kraljevi Vrelec) contained little As(V)
   (only detectable with the selective coprecipitation technique) and the
   Rogaska mineral waters (Tempel, Donat Mg) (very) high As(V)
   concentrations. Rogaska, Donat Mg even had an average As(V)
   concentration around the permittable level of 50 mug l(-1) for arsenic
   in minerals waters, viz. 47.8 mug l(-1). Speciation calculations based
   on pH and E-h and taking into account the ionic strength gave a similar
   speciation pattern then speciation analysis with additional information
   about the degree of protonation of As(III) and As(V). (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR) were developed
   using a genetic algorithm (GA)-based variable-selection approach with
   quantum chemical descriptors derived from AM1-based calculations
   (MOPAC7.0). With the QSPR models, the aqueous solubility of 71 aromatic
   sulfur-containing carboxylates, including phenylthio, and phenylsulfonyl
   carboxylates were efficiently estimated and predicted. Using GA-based
   multivariate linear regression (NILR) with cross-validation procedure,
   the most important descriptors were selected from a pool of 28 quantum
   chemical semi-empirical descriptors, including steric and electronic
   types, to build QSPR models. The molecular descriptors included
   molecular surface (SA), charges on carboxyl group (Q(OC)), the magnitude
   of the difference between E-HOMO of the solute and E-LUMO of water,
   divided by 100 (E-B), which were main factors affecting the aqueous
   solubility of the compounds of interest. The resulted coefficients R and
   R-2 of 0.9571 and 0.9161 and the prediction residual error sum of
   squares (PRESS) of 13.1768, revealed that it was accurate and reliable
   for the model to predict the aqueous solubility of the investigated
   organic compounds. If two outliers were omitted from the dataset, the
   resulted coefficients R = 0.9619, R-2 = 0.9253, and PRESS = 10.3875 were
   significantly improved. Compared with stepwise regression analysis, the
   results obtained in this work were better and more reasonable. The best
   QSPR model were obtained by GA-based MLR. Reasonable mechanisms for
   aqueous solubility of the sulfur-containing carboxylates were
   investigated and interpreted. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Not much is known about sedimentation of organic particles in rivers.
   Plate sediment traps deployed in fast flowing River Spree and in a
   slowly flowing side arm yielded trapping rates between 0.7 and 52 gDW
   m(-2) d(-1). A linear regression between flow velocity and trapping
   rates was used to extrapolate from point measurements to areal average
   trapping rates, which were 11 gDW m(-2) d(-1) in the side arm and 1.4
   gDW m(-2) d(-1) in the free flowing river section. These rates are
   typical for the River Spree, but different from other rivers. The plate
   trap measurements provide the basic variables for the sedimentation rate

Abstract = {{In order to confirm the possibility of removing PO4-P, Mg and Ca from
   swine wastewater through artificial crystallization by aeration,
   laboratory and pilot scale experiments were carried out using actual
   swine wastewater. The pH of swine wastewater increased up to
   approximately 8.5 with continuous aeration, and a large part of the
   soluble PO4-P, Mg and Ca was crystallized. The ingredients of the
   crystals were estimated as MAP and HAP according to their mole ratio of
   NH4-N, PO4-P, Mg and Ca. The sedimentation speed of crystals in swine
   wastewater was about 3 m h(-1), and over 90\% of them had settled after
   standing I h. A pilot scale reactor with the dual functions of
   crystallization by aeration and settling was operated continuously using
   actual swine wastewater, with aeration conditions of HRT 4.1 h and 26
   m(3) air h(-1) m(-2) cross section (18 m(3) air h(-1) m(-3) volume).
   During 50 days of operation, pH at the aeration column held stable at
   8.0, and 65\% Of PO4-P, 51\% of Mg, and 34\% of Ca were removed. (C)

Abstract = {{The amounts of sorption of Cu2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+ from water on
   cross-linked chitosan were measured. Experiments were performed as a
   function of initial pH (2-5), total metal concentration (0.77-17
   mol/m(3)), and metal concentration ratio (0.25-4) at 25degreesC in
   single- and binary-metal systems. The sorption was so highly pH
   dependent that the isotherm could not be described by one specific
   equation. A simplified equilibrium model was thus proposed considering
   competitive sorption of proton and metal ions. The number of active
   sites on chitosan bound with one metal ion was adjustable and model
   parameters could be graphically determined. Given initial metal
   concentrations and solution pH, the proposed model could predict the
   amounts of sorption of proton and metals as well as the equilibrium pH.
   In general, application of the model parameters calculated in
   single-metal systems to the prediction of sorption in binary-metal
   systems was not satisfactory due to a remarkable effect of competitive
   sorption. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Investigations of various CeO2 catalysts using XRD, O-2-TPD, H-2-TPR and
   catalytic wet air oxidation of phenol showed that CeO2 calcined under
   higher thermal impact (designated as type A) displayed excellent
   catalytic ability for the redox reaction of organics. Results of the
   investigations mentioned above showed that type A CeO2 has a less stable
   structure, more structure oxygen exchangeable and more oxidizing ability
   for the consumption of H-2 and conversion of phenol. At phenol
   concentrations between 400 and 2500 mg/L, oxygen pressure in the range
   of 0.5-1.0 MPa, and temperatures above 160degreesC phenol conversion
   stood at greater than or equal to90\% after 4 It. Total organic carbon
   removal increased with the reaction temperature. Under the reaction
   conditions, CO2 selectivity was about 80\% or more after 4 It reaction.
   The reduced catalytic ability of regenerated CeO2 was caused either by
   stabilization of CeO2 during the process of regeneration or by the
   deposition of some reaction residues. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Some biotic and abiotic soil components are able to catalyze phenol
   oxidation, producing water-insoluble polymers. In phenol-polluted water
   bodies, this phenomenon could be exploited to prevent phenol dispersion.
   The reaction kinetics of phenol polymerization catalyzed by soil samples
   drawn from unsaturated and aquifer layers was measured in slurry,
   aerated,batch reactors. Catechol was used as a model phenol. The
   observed catalytic activity is essentially abiotic and can be attributed
   to inorganic soil components. The rate of phenol removal is first-order
   with respect to both catechol and soil, concentration. Soil activity
   towards other phenolic compounds was tested, as well. Diphenols show the
   highest reactivity. Comparisons were performed with the enzymatic
   activity of phenol oxidases-containing mushroom tissues whose use has
   been envisaged in the treatment of phenol-polluted waters. The use of
   phenol oxidases can complement the intrinsic activity of soil for the
   removal of recalcitrant phenols. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Title = {{Regrowth and survival of indicator microorganisms on the surfaces of

Abstract = {{The present study covered two rural communities of South Africa: Ncera
   and Ntselamanzi villages. Raw water from Ncera river is used by the
   community of Ncera village for drinking, while the community of
   Ntselamanzi receives their drinking water from Alice purification
   system. Treated water is supplied to the community by a public standpipe
   system. In rural communities of South Africa, many households use
   polyethylene (PE) and galvanized steel (GS) containers for the storage
   of their drinking water. To investigate the regrowth and survival of
   indicator microorganisms on the surface of household containers during
   the storage of drinking water, PE and GS slides were suspended in the
   appropriate household containers for a period of 48 h. This period of 48
   h was chosen as the study period because results from the questionnaire
   indicated that the largest percentage (62\%) of households store their
   water for that length of time. The experiment was performed to test
   drinking water as it is collected and stored by rural communities. No
   disinfection of household containers or slides was done during the study
   period. Attached coliphages (F-RNA (FP) and somatic phage (SP), coliform
   bacteria (total coliform (TC), presumptive Escherichia coli (EC),
   Salmonella (Sal) and Clostridium perfringens (CP) were measured during
   the study period. With the exception of CP, attached indicator
   microorganisms consisted of TC, presumptive E. coli and Salmonella,
   somatic and F-RNA coliphages, although the yield (average count) for the
   last four groups (EC: < 1-3 cfu cm(-2), Sal: < 1-15 cfu cm(-2), FP: <
   1-7 pfu cm(-2), Sp: < 1-7 pfu cm(-2)) was lower than that of TC (3-183
   cfu cm(-2)). However, the lowest yield of indicator microorganisms was
   noted for presumptive E coli. Whereas the occurrence and survival of TC
   was noted on the surface of household containers during the entire
   period of the experimental study, other indicator microorganisms
   occurred from time to time. The regrowth of indicator microorganisms
   occurred 48 h after the exposure of slides to both types of test waters.
   This length of time mostly resulted in the regrowth of TC (with an
   increase in bacterial counts) while the persistence of other indicator
   organism groups on the surface of the slides was apparent. A comparison
   between PE and GS containers showed that more TC (average count) regrew
   on PE than on GS containers (for river water, PE: from 36 to 55 cfu
   cm(-2), GS: from 25 to 26 cfu cm(-2); for standpipe water, PE: from 147
   to 183 cfu cm(-2), GS from 3 to 4 cfu cm(-2)). This study revealed that
   both types of household containers supported the growth and survival of
   indicator microorganisms due to the bad quality of the intake water
   before storage. The storage of drinking water for 48 h mainly resulted
   in the regrowth of TC. Nevertheless, the persistence of other indicator
   microorganisms was observed on the surface of household containers. (C)

Abstract = {{Mortality pattern of different size groups (5-20 mm shell lengths) of
   the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas), was studied in the
   laboratory under different chlorine concentrations (0.25-3.0 mg l(-1)).
   Results showed that exposure time for 100\% mortality of mussels
   significantly decreased with increasing chlorine concentration. For
   example, mussels in the 10 mm size group exposed to 0.25 mg l(-1)
   chlorine residual took 1080 h to reach 100\% mortality whereas those
   exposed to 3 mg l(-1) chlorine took 252 h. All size groups (between 5
   and 20 mm shell length) took identical exposure time to reach 100\%
   mortality at given chlorine concentration (between I and 3 mg l(-1)).
   The effect of acclimation temperature on D. polymorpha mortality in the
   presence of chlorine was significant. For example, 1026 h is required to
   reach 95\% mortality using 0.5 mg l(-1) residual chlorine at 10degreesC,
   compared to 456 h at 0.50 mg l(-1) chlorine and 25degreesC. Resistance
   of D. polymorpha to chlorine appeared to be lower than that for other
   mussel species in The Netherlands viz., Mytilus edulis L. and Mytilopsis
   leucophaeata (Conrad). The present study also suggests that 100\%
   mortality data for European populations of D. polymorpha at different
   chlorine concentrations are similar to those for the North American
   populations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   solutions were ozonated at low and high pH, so as to compare both

   identified aromatic by-products were nitrobenzene and azobenzene when
   the experiment was carried out at acid pH. Formation of nitrobenzene,
   azobenzene, azoxybenzene and 2-pyridine-carboxylic was observed when the
   ozonation was carried out at basic pH. p-Chloroaniline was treated with
   ozone only at high pH and the identified by-products were in accordance
   with those obtained in the ozonation of aniline: p-chloronitrobenzene,
   4,4'-dichloroazobenzene and 4-chloro-2-pyridine-carboxylic acid. All the
   aromatic by-products found were less toxic than the raw materials. The
   pseudo-first-order constants in aniline concentration were calculated,

Abstract = {{The effects of ozone, chlorine, hydrogen peroxide, and permanganate on
   the aquatic humic matter with different molecular size fractions and the
   organic acid formation in drinking water treatment were studied. Aquatic
   humus in lake water (LW), artificially recharged groundwater (AW), and
   purified artificially recharged groundwater (PW) were fractionated by
   high-pressure size-exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC) with UV-254 nm
   detection before and after oxidation, a technique which resulted
   generally in seven peaks. The sum of the molecular size fractions (SMSF)
   of the LW was reduced by 47\% during the bank filtration process, and
   the SMSF of the AW was reduced by 55\% during the process in the water
   treatment plant. The oxidation of the AW resulted in reductions in the
   range of 18-35\% of the SMSF; the respective range of the PW was
   15-69\%. However, the content of the total organic carbon (TOC) reduced
   only slightly, and a high correlation between the TOC and the SMSF
   (0.911) was observed in the whole material. The greatest decreases
   appeared in the highest-molecular-weight fractions while the
   low-molecular-weight fractions remained nearly unchanged. The total
   content of the six organic small-molecular-weight acids (sum of the
   organic acids, SOA) (formate, acetate, propionate, pyruvate, oxalate,
   and citrate) varied between 0.1-5.1\% and 0.1-9.7\% of the reduced TOC
   in the AW and the PW, respectively. The formation of the SOA, especially
   of oxalate, was the greatest after hydrogen peroxide combined with
   ozonation (as much as I 100 mug/L), while chlorination resulted in the
   SOA of < 50 mug/L. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The salt dilution (gulp injection) technique is a well established and
   widely used technique to measure stream discharge, flow velocity and
   water residence characteristics in small headwater streams. However, the
   impact of the technique on water quality and instream ecology has been
   largely ignored in field investigations. A series of experiments were
   undertaken in a regulated and groundwater-dominated river to examine the
   effects on aquatic invertebrate drift at high, medium and low
   discharges. In the groundwater-dominated river, drift significantly
   increased as a result of the introduction of the saline solution tinder
   all flows. Drift increased at the regulated site under low and
   intermediate flow but not during high flows, probably due to a natural
   increase in drift associated with spate conditions. Following the
   application of the saline solution several taxa absent or infrequently
   occurring in background samples, such as the cased caddisfly, Agapetus
   fuscipes, were recorded. The wider implications of the technique are
   discussed in relation to short-term pulsed pollution episodes and the
   management of riverine ecosystems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The biosorption of chromium(VI) and nickel(II) ions, both singly and in
   combination, by dried activated sludge was investigated in a batch
   system as a function of initial pH and single- and dual-metal ion
   concentrations. The working initial pH values for single chromium(VI)
   and nickel(II) biosorptions were determined as 1.0 and 4.5,
   respectively. It was observed that the co-ion effect on the equilibrium
   uptake became more pronounced as the co-ion concentration in solution
   increased and pH level increased for chromium(VI) and decreased for
   nickel(II). Adsorption isotherms were developed for both the single- and
   dual-metal ion systems at these two pH values and expressed by the mono-
   and multi-component Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models and model
   parameters were estimated by the non-linear regression. It was seen that
   the mono-component adsorption equilibrium data fitted very well to both
   the monocomponent adsorption models for both the components and the pH
   values studied while the multi-component Freundlich adsorption model
   adequately predicted the multi-component adsorption equilibrium data at
   moderate ranges of initial mixture concentrations for both the studied
   pH values. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In Noirmoutier, a French island off the Atlantic coast, secondary
   effluents flow into a series of four lagoons, 1.4-2.8 m deep, and are
   reused for agricultural irrigation. The excess water is disposed of to
   the sea. The aim of this study was to provide a model capable of
   predicting the microbiological quality of the water pumped for
   irrigation or discharged to the sea. Meteorological variables, flow
   rates, physical-chemical characteristics and faecal coliform (FC)
   contents were monitored for a year and a half. The hydraulic pattern of
   each lagoon was assumed to be that of completely mixed reactor because
   of the calculated dispersion numbers and the wind mixing effect.
   Coliform decay was assumed to follow first order kinetics in each
   lagoon. Die-off coefficients were calculated in each lagoon using a
   nonsteady-state model. The main bacterial removal mechanism was shown to
   be solar irradiation. Empirical equations were established to calculate
   die-off coefficients as a function of received solar energy and
   temperature. FC die-off rates were higher in the first lagoon and then
   decreased successively in those following. FC numbers in the different
   lagoons were predicted with reasonable accuracy in spite of high
   variation in inlet water quality. The model will facilitate the
   prediction of water quality under various climatic conditions and
   different water reuse scenarios and will help to optimise reclamation
   and storage facilities. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Bacterial biofilm growth on a pilot lab scale anaerobic fluidized bed
   bioreactor under mesophilic conditions is analyzed in this paper.
   Biolite was used as substratum and the system was fed with acetic acid
   as sole carbon source. Bed expansion was maintained around 40\%. It was
   observed that the decrease of the expansion provoked a biomass increase
   in the reactor and the decrease of the removal rate of organic matter.
   This can be explained by a mass transfer limitation phenomenon. Volatile
   fatty acids accumulated within the system when the expansion of the
   fluidized bed was lower than 10\%.
   An initial bed segregation was observed. Biomass adhesion and growth
   influenced bioparticle size and density, which contributed to further
   bed segregation. Biomass concentration in the bottom part of the bed
   showed higher values than in the upper levels. On the other hand,
   biofilm density increased towards the reactor bottom, wherein it showed
   the highest values. Methanogenic tests were conducted using acetic,
   propionic and butyric acids. These assays indicated that total activity
   was higher in bioparticle sampled from upper reactor levels. This was
   explained by the lower biofilm density values in this zone and mass
   transfer limitation phenomena. Moreover, biomass was unable to degrade
   acids different from acetic while performing the activity tests. This
   was probably due to the fact that acetic acid was the sole carbon source
   fed to the reactor. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the treatment characteristics of nitrate and toxic
   pesticide by a combined bioelectrochemical reactor (BER)/adsorption
   process was investigated. Experimental results showed that the
   disappearance of NO3- in BER was in accordance with the applied current.
   NO2- was not detected in the effluent, but the production of NO was
   increased with increasing IPT loading. In the presence of IPT, up to
   30\% of the nitrate nitrogen consumed was converted to N2O, while more
   than 95\% converted to N-2 in the absence of IPT. In adsorption column,
   IPT was efficiently removed onto either granular activated carbon or
   silicone resin so as to meet the guideline value (40 mug/l) and to
   reduce the N2O accumulation. A simplified kinetic model that considers
   the sequential reduction of nitrate and inhibition of the N2O reduction
   step by pesticide as well as Langmuir adsorption isotherm was developed
   and used to evaluate the process performance. Theoretically predicted
   effluent concentrations were in good agreement with the observed results
   for nitrate, nitrite, N2O, N-2 and IPT. It was considered that high
   removal performance of nitrate and pesticide by the combined process is
   attributable to high affinity of adsorbates for IPT in comparison with
   relatively large inhibition constant (K-i). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{We investigated three small streams in the New Territories of Hong Kong,
   China. In each stream, we compared the benthic macroinvertebrate fauna
   of one site immediately upstream of an area of agricultural land (market
   gardening) with a second site immediately downstream. Each pair of sites
   was <300 m apart. Samples were taken at the end of the dry season (March
   2000) and again (April 2000) just after heavy rainfall had caused runoff
   from the fields. The total number of taxa at the downstream sites was
   the same as that in the upstream sites in March. In April, the total
   taxon richness was lower at the downstream localities although this
   difference was statistically significant in only one stream. The acute
   toxic effect of runoff became clearer when focusing on the group of
   sensitive benthic fauna. The grouping was done by ranking the relatively
   physiological tolerance to organotoxins following the relevant
   literature (Bull. Environ. Contam. Toxicol. 67 (2001) 360). All streams
   showed a significant downstream decrease in the number of sensitive taxa
   in April, while in two of three streams the number of relatively
   tolerant taxa increased. Ordination (by n-MDS) confirmed this pattern.
   It revealed a marked temporal trend in all streams resulting from a
   decrease of sensitive taxa downstream that was not apparent at the
   upstream sites. The size of the observed effects varied among streams,
   and may have reflected differences in the composition of the
   agricultural runoff. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrodynamics of microbial aggregates, including settling velocity
   and permeability features, were investigated through detailed settling
   experiments. Microbial aggregates ranging from 1.0 to 2.5 mm were
   generated in a lab-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) and also
   collected from a full-scale activated sludge (AS) treatment process. An
   apparatus of vertically connected double settling columns, filled with
   solutions of different densities, was used to measure the settling
   velocities and thus to characterise the internal permeation of
   individual microbial aggregates. It was demonstrated that the microbial
   aggregates were highly porous and fractal. However, their settling
   velocities observed in deionised water, EDTA and NaCl solutions were
   only slightly faster than predicted by Stokes' law for identical but
   impermeable particles. The fluid collection efficiencies calculated from
   measured settling velocities were less than 0.10 for most microbial
   aggregates, which was much lower than those previously determined for
   nonbiological aggregates of latex microspheres. It is suggested that
   microbial aggregates could have a largely reduced permeability, as the
   pores between the microorganisms in the aggregates may be clogged by the
   cell's exopolymeric material with the water retained. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Title = {{A new rechargeable dialysis pore water sampler for monitoring
   sub-aqueous in-situ sediment caps}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{36}},

Pages = {{3121-3129}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A new rechargeable dialysis pore water sampler is proposed that is
   adapted to the requirements of monitoring in-situ sediment remediation
   techniques, in particular in-situ capping. Sampling and recharging of
   the sampler can be carried out from a boat or a pontoon by means of
   separate tubing and a peristaltic pump. The possibility of repeated
   sampling permits a temporal as well as a spatial resolution of pore
   water geochemistry. This aims to facilitate a monitoring of temporal
   variations in contaminant profiles within a cap matrix. To meet these
   particular requirements the basic peeper design is modified. In this
   manuscript constructive details and materials used are discussed as well
   as the feasibility and reliability of the sampling and recharging
   process. The peeper is designed for 1 m depth profile with spatial
   resolution of 1/5.5 cm and the practical temporal resolution, that
   chiefly depends on sediment characteristics, is 1/3 weeks. Results from
   laboratory and field testing show that sample volumes of 20 cm 3 can be
   obtained from a depth of 8 m without mixing of sample and recharge
   water. The field test results with an exposure time of 8 months indicate
   that no clogging of neither the membranes nor the sample tubing
   occurred. The temporal development of the concentration-vs. -depth
   profiles of sodium, iron, and nickle, chosen as examples from the
   investigated metals in the pore water, document the stability of the
   monitoring system. The results thus corroborate that this new type of
   sampler can be employed as a tool for monitoring contaminants at the
   sediment-to-water interface and particularly within an in-situ cap. (C)

Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3130-3140}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Sandy soil, which was highly contaminated with alkyllead compounds, was
   taken from bore cores from a site of a former tetraalkyllead producing
   company. It was analyzed for its capacity to chemically and/or
   biologically degrade alkyllead contaminants. For this purpose, soil
   samples were supplied with oxygen or oxygen + minerals at different
   water saturation. For long-term elution, contaminated soil was packed
   into glass columns of 1.5 m length and 10 cm diameter. Oxygen-saturated
   water was recirculated in an upflow mode. Within a time span of 260 days
   tetraethyllead was completely eluted from the sandy soil and was
   apparently converted to triethyllead by chemical or microbiological
   reaction. The triethyllead concentration in the circulating water
   accounted for 60-80\% of the maximal amount, that could be formed from
   tetraethyllead by a single dealkylation. This indicated that between
   20-40\% of the triethyllead were apparently further degraded. Only very
   little diethyllead accumulated in the water. The triethyllead
   concentration in the circulating water was highly toxic for non-adapted
   microorganisms. However, if a readily degradable carbon source was
   added, fast growth of indigenous soil bacteria was observed, but only
   little alkyllead degradation occurred. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Cryptosporidium parvum, a protozoan parasite, has been implicated in a
   number of waterborne disease outbreaks. It is difficult to inactivate
   using free chlorine, but appears to be easily inactivated by ozone.
   Therefore, the US EPA has promulgated the Interim Enhanced Surface Water
   Treatment Rule, which for the first time, addresses the control of C
   parvum in drinking water. The use of Ct (concentration of disinfectant
   in mg/L times, time in minutes) values is being considered as one of the
   options for controlling this organism. This paper proposes a Ct
   equation, based on first order kinetics, to provide guidance to drinking
   water utilities for the application of ozone for controlling C parvum
   oocysts in drinking water. The equation, which provides mean estimates
   of inactivation, was developed using standard statistical techniques and
   currently available field and bench scale data. In addition, the
   possibility of using a statistically conservative upper bound Ct value
   in order to insure an appropriate safety factor is explored. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The Integrated on-Farm Drainage Management (IFDM) system was designed to
   dispose of selenium (Se)contaminated agricultural irrigation drainage
   water through the sequential reuse of saline drainage water to grow
   crops having different salt tolerance. This study quantified the extent
   of biological volatilization in Se removal from the IFDM system located
   in the western San Joaquin Valley, California. Selenium volatilization
   from selected treatment areas, including pickleweed (Salkornia bigelovii
   Torr.), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata L.), bare soil, and the solar
   evaporator, was monitored biweekly using an open-flow sampling chamber
   system during the pickleweed growing season from February to September
   1997. and monthly from September 1997 to January 1998. Biological
   volatilization from the pickleweed section removed 62.0 +/- 3.6 mg Se
   m(-2) y(-1) to the atmosphere, which was 5.5-fold greater than the Se
   accumulated in pickleweed tissues (i.e., phytoextraction). The total Se
   removed by volatilization from the bare soil, saltgrass, and the solar
   evaporator was 16.7 +/- 1.1, 4,8 +/- 0.3, and 4.3 +/- 0.9 mg Se m(-1)
   y(-1), respectively. Selenium removal by volatilization accounted for
   6.5\% of the annual total Se input (957.7 mg Se m(-2) y(-1)) in the
   pickleweed field, and about 1\% of the total Se input (432.7 mg Se m(-2)
   y(-1)) in the solar evaporator. We concluded that Se volatilization
   under naturally occurring field conditions represented a relatively
   minor, but environmentally important pathway of Se removal from the IFDM
   system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Newly recognized waterborne pathogens such as microsporidia are being
   detected in the world's water supplies with increasing frequency. Many
   of these organisms have been shown to cause negative health impacts for
   both immunocompetent as well as immunocompromised individuals. It is
   imperative that these emerging pathogens be investigated for their
   ability to resist both traditional and novel disinfection technologies
   that are currently in use or under consideration for drinking water
   treatment. Low- and medium pressure UV light is at the cutting edge of
   disinfection technologies for the drinking water industry. While
   previous UV disinfection studies have focused on the inactivation of
   Cryptosporidium and Giardia as well as viruses and common bacteria, this
   research reports the ability of low- and medium pressure UV light to
   inactivate >3.6 log(10) of microsporidia Encephalitozoon intestinalis
   spores at a dose of 6 mJ/cm(2) or higher as determined using a cell

Abstract = {{We studied the effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and loading on
   anaerobic digestion of poultry slaughterhouse wastes, using
   semi-continuously fed, laboratory-scale digesters at 31degreesC. The
   effect on process performance was highly significant: Anaerobic
   digestion appeared feasible with a loading of up to 0.8 kg volatile
   solids (VS)/m(3) d and an HRT of 50-100 days. The specific methane yield
   was high, from 0.52 to 0.55m(3)/kg VSadded. On the other hand, at a
   higher loading, in the range from 1.0 to 2.1 kg VS/m(3) d, and a shorter
   HRT, in the range from 25 to 13 days, the process appeared inhibited
   and/or overloaded, as indicated by the accumulation of volatile fatty
   acids and long-chain fatty acids and the decline in the methane yield.
   However, the inhibition was reversible.
   The nitrogen in the feed, ca. 7.8\% of total solids (TS), was organic
   nitrogen with little ammonia present, whereas in the digested material
   ammonia accounted for 52-67\% (up to 3.8 g/l) of total nitrogen. The TS
   and VS removals amounted to 76\% and 64\%, respectively. Our results
   show that on a continuous basis under the studied conditions and with a
   loading of up to 0.8 kg VS/m(3) d metric ton (wet weight) of the studied
   waste mixture could yield up to 140 m 3 of methane. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, a potentially toxic blooming
   cyanobacterium (blue-green alga), responsible for public health problems
   in Australia, was identified in France in 1994 in a shallow pond south
   of Paris. A program monitoring the occurrence of C raciborskii in this
   pond was conducted from July 1998 to October 1999. The phytoplankton
   assemblages were studied, and limnological parameters (water
   temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, and dissolved inorganic
   nutrients) were measured. By multivariate analysis (principal component
   analysis), we showed that sufficiently high temperatures to allow the
   germination of akinetes, relatively low nutrient concentrations (soluble
   reactive phosphorus with a mean concentration of I muM and nitrate
   between 0 and 5 muM, except in February 1999 (21 muM)) and a
   characteristic high and constant sulfate concentration (8981+/-471 muM)
   seemed to be the main factors involved in the proliferation of C
   raciborskii in the ``Francs-Neheurs{''} (FP) pond, In the light of these
   findings and of bibliographic data, C raciborskii would seem to be
   characterized by good adaptability, but also by low competitiveness with
   other phytoplanktonic species in the temperate study area. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The chemical fractionation and bioleaching of Mn, At, Zn, Cu and Ti in
   municipal sewage sludge were investigated using Thiobacillus
   ferrooxidans as leaching microorganism. As a result of the bacterial
   activity, ORP increase and pH reduction were observed. Metal
   solubilization was accomplished only in experimental systems
   supplemented with energy source (Fe(II)). The solubilization efficiency
   approached similar to80\% for Mn and Zn, 24\% for Cu, 10\% for At and
   0.2\% for Ti. The chemical fractionation of Mn, At, Zn, Cu and Ti was
   investigated using a five-step sequential extraction procedure employing
   KNO3. KF, Na4P2O7, EDTA and HNO3. The results show that the bioleaching
   process affected the partitioning of Mn and Zn, increasing its
   percentage of elution in the KNO3 fraction while reducing it in the KF,
   Na4P2O7 and EDTA fractions. No significant effect was detected on the
   partitioning of Cu and Al. However, quantitatively the metals Mn, Zn, Cu
   and At were extracted with higher efficiency after the bacterial
   activity. Titanium was unaffected by the bioleaching process in both
   qualitative and quantitative aspects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Start-up of two acidogenic reactors under mesophilic (37degreesC) and
   thermophilic (55degreesC) conditions was carried out with methanogenic
   granular sludge as an inoculum and dairy wastewater as feed. During
   these 71 days of the start-up period, microbial community dynamics in
   these two acidogenic reactors, as monitored by denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis (DGGE) and dot-blot hybridization with group-specific
   oligonucleotide probes, was correlated to reactor performance. Due to pH
   drop to 5.5, DGGE community fingerprints for domains Bacteria and
   Archaea populations showed significant shifts after 13 days of
   operation, and this change was accompanied with an increase in volatile
   fatty acid production, a decrease in methane formation, and rapid sludge
   disintegration, Dot-blot hybridization results further indicated that
   the decrease in methane production was related to the decrease in
   Archaea population in particular with methanogens from 34.1\% of total
   16S-rRNA in the seed sludge to 8\% within the first 13 days, and to 25\%
   at day 71. Among the methanogens monitored, the class Methanomicrobiales
   was the most abundant followed up by Methanobacteriales and
   Methanococcales. Due to an elevated temperature, the microbial community
   change was more significant and rapid in the thermophilic reactor than
   in the mesophilic reactor. Significant microbial population changes took
   place at the first 13 days for both reactors, but a longer period up to
   71 days was required to establish a microbial community with a stable
   metabolic activity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was operated in the conventional
   anaerobic-aerobic mode for enhanced biological phosphate removal (EBPR)
   using acetate as the sole substrate. Results showed that, however, the
   reactor was unable to remove phosphate from wastewater. The sludge
   containing 1.65\% of phosphate did not exhibit the typical
   characteristics of polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAO) or
   glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAO). Phylogenetic analysis, based on
   16S rDNA sequences of individual microorganisms, showed that the
   microbial community of this acetate-degrading sludge was closely related
   to Comamonas testosteroni (43.8\% of total population) of
   beta-1-proteobacteria, Zoogloea resiniphila (25.0\%) of
   beta-2-proteobacteria, and Xanthomonas maltophilia (19.8\%) of
   gamma-proteobacteria. Results of this study imply that GAO might not be
   the sole group of bacteria responsible to the deterioration of phosphate
   removal efficiency in an EBPR reactor. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Crushed crab shells were chemically treated to transform the chitin
   present into chitosan. Three particle sizes with average diameters of
   0.65, 1.43 and 3.38 mm, average pore diameters ranging from approximate
   to 300 to 540 Angstrom, and a specific surface area of;:t 30 m(2)/g were
   obtained. Batch experiments were performed to study the uptake
   equilibrium and kinetics of cadmium by chitosan. Adsorption equilibrium
   followed a Freundlich relationship and was found to be independent of
   particle size indicating that adsorption takes place largely in the pore
   space. A high initial rate of cadmium uptake was followed by a slower
   uptake rate suggesting intraparticle diffusion as the rate-limiting
   step. The kinetic uptake data were successfully modeled using a pore
   diffusion model incorporating nonlinear adsorption. The effect of
   boundary layer resistance was modeled through inclusion of a mass
   transfer expression at the outside boundary, Two fitting parameters, the
   tortuosity factor (tau) and the mass transfer coefficient at the outside
   boundary (k(c)) were used. These parameters were unique for all solute
   and sorbent concentrations. The tortuosity factors varied from 1.5 for
   large particles to 5.1 for small particles. The mass transfer
   coefficient varied from 2 x 10(-7) m/s at 50 rpm to 2 x 10(-3) m/s at
   200 rpm. At agitation rates below 100 rpm, boundary layer resistance
   reduced the uptake rate significantly. Its very high sorption capacity
   and relatively low production cost make chitosan an attractive sorbent
   for the removal of heavy metals from waste streams. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We investigated the validity and sensitivity of assessments of the
   induction of atrazine tolerance in freshwater outdoor mesocosmic
   phytoplankton communities, using the in vivo fluorescence of chlorophyll
   a as an endpoint, for monitoring ecotoxicology and for risk assessment
   programs applied to phytoplankton contaminated by photosystem II
   herbicides. Atrazine inhibits the photosynthetic process. and so the
   rise in in-vivo fluorescence could be used as a physiological
   manifestation of acute toxicity. Short-term tests (I h) were used, in
   which increasing concentrations of the herbicide were applied to
   phytoplankton samples taken every two days from the mesocosms, and used
   to plot dose-response curves. The concentration at which atrazine
   increased the fluorescence by 25\% relative to control samples was used
   to demonstrate the sensitivity of the phytoplankton, and the values
   found were compared for samples from different mesocosms (contaminated
   and non-contaminated). The taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton
   was also determined. The data showed that chronic exposure (25 days) to
   30 mug/L of atrazine significantly increased the apparent tolerance of
   the phytoplankton to further contamination by the same compound. The use
   of in vivo fluorescence of chlorophyll a appears to be a reliable and
   effective parameter for monitoring the effects of atrazine pollution,
   and detecting the changes in community tolerance driven by pollution
   selection pressure. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anodic Fenton treatment (AFT) is a new technology that has several
   advantages over classic Fenton treatment and electrochemical Fenton
   treatment. The oxidation of diazinon by AFT using different electrolytes
   has been investigated. NaCl, KCl and Na2SO4 show similar effects on the
   extent and rate of oxidation, and the data can be fitted quite well by
   the AFT kinetics model. Use of NaNO3 as the electrolyte causes
   low-efficiency electrolysis and a subsequent low oxidation rate for
   diazinon. The NaCl concentration level in the anodic half-cell and the
   concentration ratio between the two half-cells is optimized at 0.04 M
   and 4:1 (cathodic/anodic), respectively. The activation energy of
   diazinon oxidation by anodic Fenton treatment is estimated to be 12.6
   +/- 0.6 kJ mol(-1), which is less than half of that for aqueous chlorine
   treatment. Diazoxon is the intermediary oxidation product. The oxidation
   of diazinon as a formulated product has also been investigated. Its
   dissipation kinetics can also be fitted quite well by the AFT model.
   Compared with the oxidation of pure diazinon, the oxidation rate of
   formulated diazinon is much lower, an indication that many formulation
   ingredients compete with diazinon for reaction with the hydroxyl
   radical. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A simple empirical model for the thickening function of the activated
   sludge secondary clarifiers is presented. The proposed approach relies
   on the integration of previous models and it is based on the phenomenon
   of dilution of the incoming activated sludge in the feeding well of the
   settling tanks. The method provides a satisfactory description of sludge
   stratification within the clarifier. The only requirements are limited
   to parameters which are readily incorporated into the routine analysis
   performed in an activated sludge plant, thereby eliminating the need for
   additional experimental or computational effort. The method was tested
   in a full-scale activated sludge plant and it was found that it
   describes fairly well the return sludge concentration, the diluted
   sludge blanket concentration, the sludge blanket solids concentration
   and the sludge blanket height of full-scale secondary clarifiers. (C)

Title = {{Toxicity of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate in anaerobic digestion:
   influence of exposure time}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{3253-3260}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The inhibition of anaerobic digestion by the anionic surfactant linear
   alkylbenzene sulfonate was studied. The development of bacterial
   activity during several weeks was monitored by performing batch
   degradation tests with acetate and propionate. In the first phase the
   decay of activity without surfactant addition was studied. After the
   addition of the surfactant an immediate inhibition was detected.
   Subsequently, the degradation activity continued to decrease with
   increasing exposure time. Both, the immediate inhibition and the rate of
   the subsequent decrease of activity were dependent on the surfactant
   concentration. A kinetic model is presented that describes this
   behavior, A surfactant concentration of 14 mg L-1 causes a 50\%
   immediate inhibition of acetate degradation (27 mg L-1 in the case of
   propionate degradation). Additionally, each 12 mg L-1 of surfactant
   increases the decay rate of acetate degradation activity by a factor 10
   (23 mg L-1 for propionate degradation). A deviation from this model
   occurs at low surfactant concentrations (< 3 mg L-1), where a slight
   stimulation of bacterial activity was observed. The above-mentioned
   concentrations refer to measured surfactant concentrations, These were
   substantially lower than the nominal concentrations (added surfactant
   per volume). This discrepancy is explained by adsorption of the
   surfactant to the biomass. Finally, the importance of the presented
   kinetic model and the significance of surfactant toxicity for anaerobic
   digestion are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   However, if the sludge is mixed with a small amount of a suitable
   microwave absorber (such as the char produced in the pyrolysis itself)
   temperatures of up to 900degreesC can be achieved, so that pyrolysis
   takes place rather than drying. Microwave treatments were also compared
   with those carried out in a conventional electric furnace, as well as

Abstract = {{The change in the absorbance upon chlorination (the differential
   absorbance, DeltaA) of natural organic matter (NOM) that has been
   concentrated, isolated, and/or fractionated from five sources was
   explored as a possible indicator of the formation of total organic
   halogen (TOX) in the samples. The results demonstrate that concentration
   and isolation of NOM using techniques that are currently in widespread
   use does not significantly alter the TOX-DeltaA(272) relationship that
   applies to the unprocessed NOM, However. when such samples are
   fractionated, the TOX-DeltaA(272) relationships for the different
   fractions are not identical. In particular, when the hydrophobic and
   hydrophilic neutral fractions of NOM are chlorinated, the amount of TOX
   formed per unit of A(272) destroyed is significantly larger than the
   corresponding value for other NOM fractions. This observation might
   reflect the relatively high content of proteins and other amino acid
   structures that can be disinfection by-product precursors but that
   absorb little or no light at 272 nm. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study examined correlations between the differential absorbance at
   272nm (DeltaA(272)) and the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs)
   in chlorinated water from the Tolt River, a water source for Seattle,
   WA. The DBPs investigated included chloroform (CHCl3),
   dichlorobromomethane (CHCl2Br), mono-, di- and trichloroacetic acids
   (MCAA, DCAA, and TCAA, respectively), chloral hydrate (CH),
   dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) and 1,1,1-trichloropropanone (TCP). Whereas
   the kinetics of DBP formation are complex and are non-linear, the same
   DBP data represented as a function of DeltaA(272) are quite simple.
   Absorbance decreases when the water is chlorinated, i.e., DeltaA(272) is
   always negative. The DBP vs. -DeltaA(272) correlations can almost always
   be quantified by linear equations, at least above some threshold value
   of -DeltaA(272), with R2 values > 0.95. The only DBP that did not follow
   this trend was CH, for which an exponential relationship better
   described the data. TCP and DCAN were unstable at pH 7 and 8, but at pH
   6 linear correlations between their concentrations and -DeltaA(272) were
   as strong as those for the more stable DBPs. The threshold -DeltaA(272)
   value is approximately the same for many of the DBPs studied, supporting
   the hypothesis that individual DBPs are released following the formation
   of a common intermediate, or at least a small group of similar
   intermediates. The DBP vs. -DeltaA(272) correlations may have practical
   value since they provide an alternative approach for monitoring the
   formation of individual DBP species on-line, but the generality of the
   relationships needs to be further examined. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate an optimised immunofluorescence
   assay in terms of the variability of sets of counts for Cryptosporidium
   parvum oocyst suspensions and data recovery and the reliability of the
   procedure. A coefficient of variation (CV) of 10\% was determined to be
   the maximum value acceptable for count variability. It was found that
   the optimised IFA tested provided a high precision for the sets of
   enumerations for suspensions containing 800-20,000 oocysts/mL. The
   procedure was found to be robust and providing high recovery level
   (96.3\%). In terms of counting precision, the technique described here
   approaches the performance of flow cytometry and surpasses other manual
   techniques with a CV of 10\% for a concentration close to 800
   oocysts/mL. The procedure described is particularly suitable for the
   production of seed doses and for other applications requiring the
   titration of oocyst suspensions with a high degree of precision and

Abstract = {{A bacteriological and chemical study was carried out within I year on
   spring and well water of Yaounde. It assessed the importance of some
   chemical factors on some faecal bacterial communities. The monthly
   average densities of faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci varied,
   respectively, from 1 to 72 x 10(2) CFU 100 ml(-1), and from I to 31 x
   10(2) CFU 100 ml(-1) of water. These bacterial abundances undergo
   spatio-temporal fluctuations. These spring and well waters which are
   slightly bicarbonate, are acidic. soft. with low to average
   mineralisation. Most of the chemical characteristics of these waters are
   relatively stable with time, with respect to apparent spatial
   fluctuations. The degree of correlation between chemical parameters and
   the abundance dynamics of isolated bacteria is heterogeneous. In an
   artificially constituted spring biotope. the increase in pH. electrical
   conductivity, concentration of dissolved oxygen, chloride, sodium,
   potassium. calcium and magnesium favoured (P<0.01) the abundance of
   faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci, The high concentration of
   dissolved CO2 reduces (P<0.001) the abundances of these bacteria. They
   would nevertheless have developed such a mechanism allowing to minimise
   inhibitory effects of some environmental factors. In the well water, the
   ecology of faecal streptococci and faecal coliforms undergoes a relative
   instability, probably due to the variability of the resultant
   interaction network. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd, All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A method has been developed for concentration of enteroviruses from
   untreated and treated domestic wastewater using bituminous coal bed as a
   virus adsorbent. A bed made from 1.5g of 120 mesh coal powder was used
   for concentrating enteroviruses from 100 ml of clarified sewage at
   different pH values with and without addition of AlCl3. To enhance the
   adsorption of viruses, requisite quantities of aluminium chloride were
   added so that a final concentration of 0.0005 M could be achieved. At pH
   3.0 maximum adsorption (82.8\%) of poliovirus type I from artificially
   contaminated clarified sewage was observed without addition of AlCl3.
   However, at pH 5.0 maximum virus adsorption of 98.7\% was achieved after
   addition of aluminium chloride. An average recovery of 86.9\% of
   adsorbed viruses at pH 5.0 was achieved from coal bed with 3\%
   flocculating beef extract at pH 9.5.
   This method for concentration of enteroviruses incorporating use of coal
   was compared with that of Millipore membrane filter method applied to
   raw sewage and clarified sewage. The results obtained from the
   methodology using coal as adsorbent was subjected to Student's ``t{''}
   test and it was observed that its efficiency is confirmed for recovery
   of enteroviruses from raw and nonclarified sewage. These results are
   also comparable with that obtained with MF method. The results presented
   in this paper are indicative of the potential of this method for both
   treated and raw sewage. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effects of linoleic (C18:2), oleic (C18:1), and stearic (C18: 0)
   acids on glucose, butyrate and hydrogen degradation were investigated at
   21degreesC using a culture unacclimated to long-chain fatty acids
   (LCFAs). Diethyl ether was used to facilitate precise addition of LCFAs
   and provide adequate dispersion in cultures, Butyrate degradation was
   affected by diethyl ether but minimal effects were observed on hydrogen
   and glucose consumption, In the presence of oleic and stearic acids, the
   glucose consumption rate was similar but was similar to50\% lower in the
   presence of linoleic acid. The effect of a mixture of 100 mg 1(-1) of
   each individual LCFA (300 rug 1(-1) total LCFA) was approximately the
   same as 100 mg 1(-1) linoleic acid alone, suggesting no synergistic
   inhibition of glucose degradation. Butyric acid degradation was more
   severely inhibited by the LCFAs with inhibition becoming more severe
   with the addition of double bonds to the LCFA. Furthermore, mixtures of
   LCFAs synergistically inhibited butyric acid degradation compared to the
   results with individual LCFAs, In contrast, although lower hydrogen
   consumption rates were observed in cultures receiving oleic and linoleic
   acids compared to cultures receiving stearic acid, inhibition by all
   three acids individually or in mixture was limited. The introduction of
   LCFAs into a system may severly inhibit intermediate acid degradation
   while having little effect on acid production. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Nutrient loads to large, shallow Lake Balaton have been reduced by
   45-50\% since mid-1980s. While a delayed, but still surprisingly fast
   recovery was observed in the hypertrophic western areas of the lake,
   eutrophication followed sewage diversion from the mesotrophic northern
   basins. We assessed factors that could lead to this unusual response.
   The prime reason of the observed biomass increase might be a trend of
   increasing mean water temperature during late summers and the concurrent
   invasion of the subtropical cyanobacterium. Cylindrospermopsis
   raciborskii with superior light and nutrient utilisation capabilities.
   In the mesotrophic areas, the prerequisite of the unforeseen success of
   C raciborskii was the exceptionally high potential of this species to
   generate internal P load. Specific morphometric features of the lake
   rather than nutrient loads might substantiate the increasing dominance
   of the cyanobacterium in these areas, Our results stress the need to
   consider individual characteristics of aquatic ecosystems during
   eutrophication management. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{p-Nonylphenol, which is widely used as raw material in industrial
   activities has been regarded as an environmental endocrine disrupter. In
   an effort to develop a new treatment method for p-nonylphenol, we
   initially investigated the electrochemical behavior of p-nonylphenol by
   voltammetric techniques. The electrochemical oxidation of p-nonylphenol
   led to the formation of electropolymerized film on the glassy carbon
   electrode surface. The fouling on the electrode surface by the
   electropolymerized film was evaluated by monitoring the electrode
   response of ferrocyanide ions as the redox marker. The electrochemical
   removal of p-nonylphenol based on the formation of the
   electropolymerized film on an anode surface was performed using a carbon
   fiber (CF) with a very large surface area. The high removal efficiency
   for p-nonylphenol was obtained by applying a potential at 0.7V. The
   maximum surface coverage of electropolymerized p-nonylphenol on the CF
   was about 5 x 10(-9) Mol/cm(2). The presence of humic acid hardly
   inhibited the removal of p-nonylphenol. Furthermore, the application to
   the removal of phenol, o-chlorophenol, p-chlorophenol,
   2,4-dichlorophenol. and 2,4,5-trichlorophenol was attempted by using
   this method. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ion exchange technology is currently the best for removing nitrate from
   drinking water. However, problems related to the disposal of spent brine
   from regeneration of exhausted resins must be overcome so that ion
   exchange can be applied more widely and economically, especially in
   small communities. For this purpose, a novel spent brine recycling
   system using combined biological denitrification and sulfate reduction
   processes was developed for more efficient reuse of brine. A granular
   activated carbon (GAC) adsorption column was introduced as an additional
   step to prevent contamination of resins by bio-polymers and dissolved
   organics present in the bio-reactor effluent. Two upflow sludge blanket
   reactors (USBRs) were operated in series for 166 days to provide
   denitrification and sulfate reduction. The denitrification reactor
   provided a nitrate removal efficiency of 96\% at a nitrate-N loading
   rate of 5.4gNO(3)(-)-N/ld. The sulfate reduction efficiency of the
   sulfate reduction reactor remained similar to62\% at a sulfate loading
   rate of 1.8 g SO42-/ld.
   Five ion exchange columns containing A520E resins were repeatedly
   operated in up to 25 cycles of service and regeneration using five kinds
   of brine: one virgin 3\% NaCl and four differently recycled spent
   brines. Throughput decreased remarkably when the biologically recycled
   brine was not treated with the GAC column, probably due to the presence
   of bio-polymers and dissolved organic compounds. The sulfate reduction
   reactor placed after the denitrification step increased the bicarbonate
   concentration, which could be used as a co-regenerant with chloride. The
   inclusion of the sulfate reduction reactor into the conventional brine
   recycling system allowed. more efficient reuse of brine, resulting in
   both reduced salt consumption and brine discharge. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI), on the maximum specific
   growth rate, mu(m) and biomass yield, Y-H, of heterotrophic biomass was
   studied in batch tests conducted under high (= 10) and low (= 1.5)
   substrate-to-biomass ratios (S-0/X-0). The effects of sludge age and
   biomass acclimatization to Cr(VI) on the bacterial kinetics were also
   studied. The M. values were determined by measuring oxygen uptake rate
   (OUR) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) increase. Cr(VI)
   concentrations equal or greater than 10 mg 1(-1) inhibited the growth of
   unacclimatized activated sludge and caused a significant decrease in pm
   and YH values. The acclimatization of biomass and the selection of a
   high operating sludge age reduced the inhibitory effect of Cr(VI). At a
   sludge age of 20 days, Cr(VI) concentrations of <10 mg 1(-1) stimulated
   bacterial growth as evidenced by an increase in both the mu(m) and Y-H
   values. Determining mu(m) values by OUR and VSS methods, revealed that
   the presence of Cr(VI) in unacclimatized biomass caused an inhibitory
   effect mostly on substrate oxidation, while in acclimatized biomass,
   anabolic pathways were inhibited more. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The modeling of photodecoloration of a nonbiodegradable azo dye.
   Reactive Red 2 (RR2). in a cocktail mixture of acetone (ACE,) and
   triethylamine (TEA) solution, was investigated, It was found that the
   cocktail photolysis system was capable of completely decolorizing the
   azo dye in a very short treatment time. and the overall dye degradation
   followed pseudo-first-order decay kinetic. Three distinct stages were
   observed in the cocktail photolysis profiles. A lag phase was observed
   at the commencement of the degradation. but its duration was gradually
   reduced with the increment of the TEA concentration and the incident
   light intensity. Subsequently. a fast decay of RR-2 was observed, in
   which over 80\% of the dyes were reduced and it was interesting to find
   a tailing stage after 90-95\% of the color was removed. A quantitative
   estimation of RR2 in the cocktail photolysis system was also Studied.
   The differential equation consisting of two parallel reactions was
   solved to predict the concentration of RR2 at any reaction time with
   very good agreements. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis indicated
   that the photosensitization process (contributed by ACE) was the
   dominant mechanism in the cocktail photolysis system, while the presence
   of a hydrogen source (TEA) did not contribute a major decay pathway but
   promoted the reaction rate of photosensitization by offering an add-on
   effect. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   a peak with g = 2.005. In contrast to anatase, the peak height was
   inversely proportional to the efficiency of hydroxyl radical production,

Abstract = {{In this study, bacteriophages were isolated from activated sludge and
   their host range was studied, Bacterial isolates were obtained from an
   activated sludge process treating urban sewage, and bacteriophages were
   obtained by plaque assay using the bacterial isolates obtained in this
   study as the host. Out of 15 bacteria isolated, 9 supported plaque
   formation. The host range test was conducted with a combination of 8
   bacteriophage isolates and 9 bacterial isolates. All of the 8
   bacteriophages tested were found to form plaques on more than 1 host.
   and 4 of them formed, plaques on both Gram-positive and Gram-negative
   bacterial isolates. Three of the 8 bacteriophages failed to form plaques
   on their original bacterial host. The experimental result indicates that
   bacteriophages are an active part of the activated sludge microbial
   ecosystem, having a very close ecological relationship with their host
   bacteria. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Performance of rapid sand filtration inter-chlorination system was
   compared with nanofiltration (NF) to reduce the arsenic health risk of
   drinking water. It was found that rapid sand filtration with
   inter-chlorination is not effective in removing arsenic, If total
   arsenic concentration in raw water is below 50 mug/L regardless of the
   turbidity of raw water, arsenic can be removed below WHO guideline value
   of 10 mug/L by conventional coagulation (polyaluminum chloride dosage is
   about 1.5 mg Al/L). However, if the raw water arsenic concentration
   exceeds 50 mug/L, more coagulant dosage or enhanced coagulation is
   needed. To adopt optimum coagulant dosage for arsenic removal. it needs
   to monitor raw water arsenic concentration, but it is difficult because
   arsenic measurement is time consuming. In addition, if raw water
   contains As(III), it is difficult for rapid sand filtration
   inter-chlorination system to meet an arsenic maximum contaminant level
   of 2 mug/L, which would achieve reduction of cancer risk below 10(-4).
   On the other hand, the NF membrane (NaCl rejection 99.6\%) could remove
   over 95\% of As(V) under relatively low-applied pressure (<1.1 MPa).
   Furthermore, more than 75\% of As(III) could be removed using this
   membrane without any chemical additives, while trivalent arsenic could
   not be removed by rapid sand filtration system without pre-oxidation of
   As(III) to As(V). Because both As(V) and As(III) removals by NF
   membranes were not affected by source water composition, it is suggested
   that NF membrane can be used in any types of waters. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Biodegradation of two a-methyl branched oxo-alcohol ethoxylates (OAE) of
   different polydispersity: LIAL 125/14 BRD (LIALB) (broad M.W.
   distribution) and LIAL 125/114 NRD (LIALN) (narrow M.W. distribution),
   both having an average of 14 oxyethylene subunits (EO) and a C12-15
   alkyl moiety were tested under the continuous flow activated sludge
   conditions of the classical Husmann plant. Primary biodegradation and
   concentration of metabolites: free oxoalcohol fraction (FOA) and
   poly(ethylene glycols) (PEG), were measured, PEG were divided into two
   fractions: short-chained PEG (PEGshch) (1-4 EO) and long-chained PEG
   (PEGlch)(>4 EO). The indirect tensammetric technique combined with an
   adequate separation was used for analysis.
   Central fission was found to be a highly dominating pathway, as is the
   case with fatty alcohol ethoxylates. OAE are highly primarily
   biodegraded (above 95\%). High concentrations of FOA and PEG are formed,
   Once formed the PEGlch are further fragmented into the PEGshch. Free
   alcohol fraction compounds are biodegraded sooner when alkyl moiety is
   shorter. OAE polydispersity has an influence on the kinetics of
   biodegradation; PEG formed from LIALN are biodegraded slower and to a
   lower degree than those from LIALB. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Pilot studies investigated the fates of color, dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC), and biodegradable organic matter (BOM) by the tandem of ozone
   plus biofiltration for treating a source water having significant color
   (50 cu) and DOC (3.2 mg/l). Transferred ozone doses were from 1.0 to 1.8
   g O-3/g C. Rapid biofilters used sand, anthracite, or granular activated
   carbon as media with empty-bed contact time (EBCT) up to 9 min. The
   pilot studies demonstrated that ozonation plus biofiltration removed
   most color and substantial DOC, and increasing the transferred ozone
   dose enhanced the removals. For the highest ozone dose, removals were as
   high as 90\% for color and 38\% for DOC. While most of the color removal
   took place during ozonation, most DOC removal occurred in the
   biofilters, particularly when the ozone dose was high. Compared to sand
   and anthracite biofilters, the GAC biofilter gave the best performance
   for color and DOC removal, but some of this enhanced performance was
   caused by adsorption, since the GAC was virgin at the beginning of the
   pilot studies. Backwashing events had no noticeable impact of the
   performance of the biofilters, The Transient-State, Multiple-Species
   Biofilm Model (TSMSBM) was used to interpret the experimental results.
   Model simulations show that soluble microbial products, which comprised
   a significant part of the effluent BOM, offset the removal of original
   BOM, a factor that kept the removal of DOC relatively constant over the
   range of EBCTs of 3.5-9 min. Although improved biofilm retention,
   represented by a small detachment rate, allowed more total biofilm
   accumulation and greater removal of original BOM, it also caused more
   release of soluble microbial products and the build up of inert biomass
   in the biofilm. Backwashing had little impact on biofilter performance,
   because it did not remove more than 25\% of the biofilm under any
   condition simulated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Complexation properties of an anthropogenic fulvic acid (FA) extracted
   from a composted sewage sludge (csFA) for Cu(II), Pb(II) and Cd(II) were
   studied at pH=6 and at a concentration of 25 mg L-1. For the case of
   Cu(II), a particular analysis of the complexation phenomena was done at
   pH values of 3, 4, 5 and 6 and at aqueous FA concentrations of 25, 50
   and 100 mg L-1 by synchronous excitation molecular fluorescence
   spectroscopy (SyF). Potentiometric titrimetry with Cu(II). Pb(II),
   Cd(II) and H+ ion-selective electrodes and acid-base conductimetric
   titrations were used to obtain experimental information about the acid
   properties and complexation phenomena. A comparison of the results
   obtained for csFA with a natural soil FA (sFA) was made. Differences
   have been detected in the structural composition of the two samples and
   in the structure of the binding sites. In the csFA, binding site
   structures containing nitrogen probably play an important role in the
   complexation, besides oxygen containing structures. Complexation by sFA
   is mainly due to carboxylic and phenolic structures. Nevertheless, this
   work shows that csFA have macroscopic complexation properties (magnitude
   of the conditional stability constant and binding sites concentration)
   somewhat similar to the natural sFA samples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The survival capacity of an Aeromonas hydrophila strain (named SB14)
   isolated from mineral water was investigated in an artificial mineral
   water microcosm. The bacterial count of this microorganism was compared
   with two strains of other species from aquatic environments (Pseudomonas
   fluorescens SSD and Pseudomonas putida SSC) and a bacterium indicative
   of faecal pollution (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922). Among the strains,
   all added to sterile Pyrex glass flasks (11) to yield a final bacterial
   count of about 5 x 10(6) CFU/ml, A. hydrophila SB14 showed a quite
   strong survival capacity (150 days). even though the Pseudomonas strains
   were better adapted to this habitat (more than 240 days). E. coli ATCC
   25922 was the least well fitted to survive and was no longer detected
   after 70 days. When A. hydrophila SB14 was inoculated together with one
   or two of the above strains, its survival appeared to be dependent on
   interaction with other organisms. A marked decrease in survival by 30
   days, possibly due to antagonistic interaction, was observed when this
   microorganism was associated with E coli ATCC 25922, and an increase by
   30 and 60 days, possibly due to commensalic interaction, was obtained
   when A. hydrophila SB14 was inoculated with P. fluorescens SSD or P.
   putida SSC, respectively. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study examined how ``weak{''} ultrasonic pre-treatment affects
   anaerobic digestion of waste biosolids, treated with a cationic
   polyelectrolyte flocculant. In relation to pre-treatment, the term
   ``weak{''} used refers to the fact that the total ultrasonic energy
   input to biosolids is insufficient to fully disrupt its floc structure
   or the cell walls, as described in the literature, Methane production
   potential, floc characteristics (size, morphology and zeta-potential)
   and process parameters (chemical oxygen demands and oxidative-reductive
   potentials) were monitored, as the digestion was tested. The presence of
   polyelectrolyte flocculants enhanced methane production within 6 days of
   digestion (phase I), but inhibited the digestion thereafter (phase II).
   Following pre-treatment by sonication (0.33 W/mL, 20 min), the methane
   productions of both original and flocculated biosolids significantly
   increased. The underlying mechanisms of weak ultrasonic pre-treatment
   are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The associated decrease of pH in slow sand filters, due to CO2
   conversion and biological activity, may produce effluent that is
   slightly corrosive to downstream distribution pipe material. This pilot
   study examined the use of a 3-cm crushed dolomite limestone media layer
   placed within the filter column of a slow sand filter to enhance
   effluent corrosion control by the introduction of beneficial dolomite
   dissolution products, without impacting turbidity removal efficiencies.
   Turbidity removal, calcium concentration, pH, conductivity, total
   hardness and alkalinity changes were calculated for the filter during a
   60-day pilot study, and water chemistry values were used to estimate the
   changes of the saturation index (SI) throughout the filter run. Total
   hardness change through the filter was compared to change calculated by
   a derived equation for hardness using calcium concentrations to
   determine if the media was dissolving in stoichiometric proportions, and
   mineral service life in the filter was estimated using an assumption of
   stoichiometric dissolution at a constant flow rate. Effluent SI was
   raised an average of 30\%, alkalinity was increased by 19\%, and
   effluent pH averaged 7.7. Filter effluent complied with current
   turbidity regulatory requirements for the provision of potable water,
   and mineral service life was estimated between 7.5 and 9.5 years. (C)

Abstract = {{In order to elucidate the biologically driven pH fluctuation phenomena
   in industrial wastewater treatment, the contrary effects of acetic acid
   (AA) and epichlorohydrin (ECH) on the pH of aeration tank were
   investigated. Two simple equations were derived to estimate optimum
   neutralization pHs for the biological AA/ECH wastewater treatment, and
   the calculated optimum neutralization pHs were compared with
   experimental results. The pH in aeration tank was expected to fluctuate
   sharply with the smallest deviation of neutralization pH from the
   optimum value, However experimental results showed that real pH
   fluctuation is smaller than the theoretical one. It was considered that
   carbonate buffer in aqueous system relieves the pH fluctuation. The
   deviation between experimental and theoretical optimum neutralization pH
   could be mainly caused by volatility of AA and ECH. The deviation was
   larger with ECH wastewater of which volatility is larger than AA.
   Finally, this theory was successfully applied to the real petrochemical
   wastewater treatment. The pH of aeration tank was properly maintained
   when acidified wastewater (pH 3.4) was supplied.) (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The simultaneous use of Fenton reagent and irradiation for the treatment
   of textile wastewaters generated during a hydrogen peroxide bleaching
   process is investigated. The experimental conditions tested during this
   study provide the simultaneous occurrence of Fenton, Fenton-like and
   photo-Fenton reactions. The batch experimental results are assessed in
   terms of total organic carbon reduction. Identification of some of the
   chemical constituents of the effluent was performed by means of GC-MS.
   Other pollution related features of the initial effluent-like COD and
   color were also measured. The main parameters that govern the complex
   reactive system, i.e., light intensity, temperature, pH, Fe(II) and H2O2
   initial concentrations have been studied. Concentrations of Fe(II)
   between 0 and 400 ppm, and H2O2 between 0 and 10,000 ppm were used.
   Temperatures above 25degreesC and up to 70degreesC show a beneficial
   effect on organic load reduction. A set of experiments was conducted
   under different light sources with the aim to ensure the efficiency of
   using solar light irradiation. The combination of Fenton, Fenton-like
   and photon-Fenton reactions has been proved to be highly effective for
   the treatment of such a type of wastewaters, and several advantages for
   the technique application arise from the study. (C) 2002 Published by

Abstract = {{We present a critical review of the relationships among three microbial
   products: extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), soluble microbial
   products (SMP), and inert biomass. Up to now, two different
   ``schools{''} of researchers have treated these products separately. The
   ``EPS school{''} has considered active biomass and EPS, while the ``SMP
   school{''} has considered active biomass, SMP, and inert biomass. Here,
   we provide a critical review of each of the microbial products. Then, we
   develop a unified theory that couples them and reconciles apparent
   contradictions. In our unified theory, cells use electrons from the
   electron-donor substrate to build active biomass, and they also produce
   bound EPS and utilization-associated products (UAP) at the same time and
   in proportion to substrate utilization. Bound EPS are hydrolyzed to
   biomass-associated products (BAP), while active biomass undergoes
   endogenous decay to form residual dead cells. Finally, UAP and BAP,
   being biodegradable, are utilized by active biomass as recycled
   electron-donors substrates. Our unified theory shows that the apparently
   distinct products from the SNIP and EPS schools overlap each other.
   Soluble EPS is actually SMP, or the sum of UAP and BAR Furthermore,
   active biomass, as defined by the SNIP school, includes bound EPS, while
   inert biomass includes bound EPS and the residual dead cells. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The primary goal of this research was to determine the potential for
   denitrification and phosphorus removal of a full-scale sequencing batch
   reactor (SBR), with and without the use of methanol as an external
   carbon source. The control SBR, without methanol addition, achieved
   negligible denitrification. Two denitrification rates were observed in
   the experimental SBR, with methanol addition; an initial fast rate and a
   slower second rate. The denitrification rate during the first rate
   period increased with increasing methanol concentration, until a maximum
   denitrification rate of similar to19 mg NOx-N/g MLVSS/day was attained.
   Following the depletion of the methanol, denitrification reactions
   probably continued by using the available natural carbon in the
   influent, resulting in a slower, second denitrification rate. Biological
   phosphorus uptake and release was significant only in the SBR with
   methanol addition. Methanol was probably not utilized as the carbon
   source for the enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) process.
   However, methanol addition was critical, since it depleted the available
   nitrates and thus allowed EBPR to take place. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

   Determination of the reaction pathway and identification of intermediate

Abstract = {{The light-induced degradation of propachlor
   (2-chloro-N-isopropylacetanilide) under simulated solar irradiation has
   been investigated in aqueous solutions containing TiO2 suspensions as
   photocatalysts. The study focuses on the identification of possible
   intermediate products and the determination of inorganic ions formed
   during the process, using several powerful analytical techniques such as
   gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) and ion chromatography. The
   primary degradation of propachlor has been a fast process with a
   half-live time of 2.3 min and followed pseudo-first-order kinetics
   according to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. The mineralization of the
   organic carbon to CO2 after 240 min of irradiation was found to be
   <63\%. The corresponding stoichiometric transformation of organic
   chlorine into chloride ion was reached in 30 min, whereas oxidation of
   nitrogen to nitrate ions took place at delayed irradiation times.
   Various aromatic intermediates have been identified by GC/MS techniques
   during the treatment, which were involved into three tentative
   degradation routes. One, was based on the dechlorination through
   positive holes or solvated electrons to form the hydroxy or aliphatic
   derivative. The second route consists of the rupture of amide bond or
   the N-C bond via nitrogen ionization by positive holes and through the
   ring hydroxylation, respectively. Finally, the third possible
   degradation route was based on hydrogen abstraction by the hydroxyl
   radicals or positive holes, followed either by the addition of oxygen to
   the alkyl radical or the decomposition of the peroxyl radical formed.
   From the analytical data, a possible multi-step degradation scheme was
   proposed. This work points to the necessity of extended knowledge of the
   successive steps in a solar-assisted detoxification process. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The elemental and isotopic composition of particulate and dissolved
   organic matter was investigated in the Piracicaba River basin, Sao Paulo
   State, Brazil. Comparison of riverine organic matter from the Piracicaba
   River basin, a region where rivers and streams receive urban sewage and
   industrial effluents, with data reported for the pristine Amazon system
   revealed significant differences associated with anthropogenic impacts.
   One important difference was N enrichment in the particulate organic
   material of the Piracicaba basin rivers, due to (a) urban and industrial
   effluents, and (b) enhanced phytoplankton growth, which results from the
   combination of nutrient enrichment and damming of sections of the
   rivers. Radiocarbon concentrations were overall more depleted (older
   C-14 age) in the Piracicaba basin rivers than in the Amazon, which may
   reflect the importance of soil erosion in the former. Analyses of stable
   and radioactive carbon isotopes and lignin-derived compounds indicated
   that coarse particulate organic material is composed of a mixture of
   soil particles and degraded organic matter from C3 and C4 vascular
   plants. Fine particulate organic material was composed mainly of soil
   particles and phytoplankton cell remains, the latter especially during
   low water, Ultrafiltered dissolved organic matter was the most degraded
   fraction according to its lignin oxidation products, and showed the
   greatest influence of C4 plant sources. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Measurements of the suspended particle concentration in a lake
   demonstrate the presence of a turbid hydrothermal plume. The plume,
   generated from a warm source develops upward carrying a suspension of
   particles from the bottom. It is found that the vertical structure of
   the plume depends on the stratification of the water column, which in
   turn depends on the seasonal meteorological conditions. During the
   stratified period of the lake, the plume is constricted to the
   hypolimnion zone. At the beginning of the summer season, the plume
   reaches the bottom of the metalimnion meanwhile at the end of this
   season the plume does not. In the mixed period of the lake, the plume
   develops in the whole water column and reaches the surface of the lake,
   where particles accumulate and spread around the center. Measurements of
   the vertical fish distribution in the stratified period show that the
   plume can constrict the fish habitat due to an increase of suspended
   particles transported by the plume. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{There is an increasing risk of a major oil spill in Australian waters
   over the next 20 years but there have been few studies on the impact of
   oil spills, and subsequent remedial action, on native Australian fauna.
   Octopus pallidus is a native Australian octopus species found in
   south-eastern Australia. The aim of the experiment was to investigate
   the effects of acute exposure to crude and dispersed crude oil and
   4-chlorophenol (a reference toxicant) on recently hatched O. pallidus by
   calculating the 48-h LC50. Water-accommodated fraction (WAF) of Bass
   Strait crude oil was prepared using a ratio of one part crude oil to
   nine parts filtered seawater and mixing for 23 h. Dispersed-WAF was
   prepared using a ratio of one part Corexit 9527 to 50 parts crude oil
   and an oil to water ratio of one to nine and mixing for 23 h. Mean (SE)
   48 h LC50 values were 0.39 (0.04), 1.83 (0.64) and 0.89 (0.08) ppm for
   WAF, dispersed-WAF and 4 chlorophenol, respectively. These results
   demonstrate that addition of the chemical dispersant Corexit 9527 to WAF
   does not increase the toxicity of WAF to O. pallidus hatchlings. (C)

Abstract = {{A Fully automated procedure based on Sequential Injection Analysis (SIA)
   methodology for simultaneous monitoring of nitrate and nitrite in
   surface water samples is described. Nitrite was determined directly
   using the Griess diazo-coupling reaction and the formed azo dye was
   measured at 540 nm in the flow cell of the fibre-optic
   spectrophotometer. Nitrate zone was passed through a reducing
   mini-column containing copperised-cadmium. After the reduction of
   nitrate into nitrite the sample was aspirated by flow reversal to the
   holding coil, treated with the reagent and finally passed through the
   flow cell. The calibration curve was linear over the range 0.05-1.00 mg
   Nl(-1) of nitrite and 0.50-50.00 mg Nl(-1) of nitrate; correlation
   coefficients were 0.9993 and 0.9988 for nitrite and nitrate,
   respectively. Detection limits were 0.015 and 0.10 mg Nl(-1) for nitrite
   and nitrate, respectively. The relative standard deviation (RSD) values
   (n = 3) were 1.10\% and 1.32\% for nitrite and nitrate, respectively.
   The total time of one measuring cycle was 250 s, thus the sample
   throughput was about 14h(-1). Nitrate and nitrite were determined in the
   real samples of surface water, and the results have been compared with
   those obtained by two other flow methods; flow injection analysis based
   on the same reactions and isotachophoretic determination used in a
   routine environmental control laboratory. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{In the present study ion exchange of Pb2+, Cu2+, Fe3+ and Cr3+ on
   natural clinoptilolite is examined at 27 +/- 1degreesC and initial
   concentration of 10 meq/dm(3). Equilibrium is favorable for Pb2+,
   unfavorable for Cu2+ and sigmoid for Cr3+ and Fe3+. Selectivity series
   deduced from equilibrium isotherms is Pb2+ >Cr3+ > Fe3+ > Cu2+ while
   when maximum exchange levels (MELs) are considered, selectivity series
   is Pb2+ > Cr3+ congruent to > F manifests the higher value of diffusion
   coefficient in the clinoptilolite particles among the metals studied,
   equal to 1.40 x 10(-9) cm(2)/s. According to the fixed bed experiments
   the upflow rate (5-15 Bed Volumes (BV)) is influencing the breakthrough
   point for all metals studied. The breakthrough point varies between 12.3
   BV for Pb2+ and 1.18 for Cu2+. Flow rate is also influencing the
   operating capacity, giving values between 0.433 meq/g(chnoptilolite) for
   Pb2+ and 0.053 for Fe3+. Breakthrough point values confirm the
   selectivity order deduced from the equilibrium isotherms, while
   operating capacity values confirm the selectivity order deduced from MEL
   experiments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Bioaugmentation with the resin acid-degrading bacterium Zoogloea

   pulp and paper mill effluent}},

Abstract = {{Efficient and reliable removal of resin acids such as dehydroabietic
   acid (DhA), which are the major toxicants in pulp and paper mill
   effluents and form pitch interfering with papermaking, is critically
   important to prevent toxicity discharge and failure of paper machines.
   Low- and high-pH stresses sometimes occur in effluent treatment systems
   due to the use of large amounts or acids and alkalines in the pulping
   processes. We found that both low- and high-pH stresses (pH 3 and 10,
   respectively) decreased the removal of total organic carbon and
   completely inhibited the removal of DhA by the biomass of an aerated
   lagoon treating pulp mill effluent. The pH stresses caused changes in
   the bacterial community structure as assessed by ribosomal intergenic
   spacer length polymorphism. The pH stresses greatly reduced the
   indigenous DhA-degrading populations in the lagoon community.
   Bioaugmentation with Zoogloea resiniphila DhA-35, a DhA-degrading
   bacterium originally isolated from a pulp mill treatment system,
   restored the DhA removal by both the low- and high-pH-stressed lagoon
   biomass. This bacterium was persistent after introduction into the
   lagoon microbial community, and its cellular rRNA:rDNA ratio increased
   during the period of DhA removal. The introduction of strain DhA-35
   changed the microbial community structure. but did not adversely affect
   the TOC removal by the community. This study suggests that it is
   feasible and potentially useful to use bioaugmentation with
   resin-acid-degrading bacteria such as DhA-35 to restore and enhance
   resin acid removal by aerated lagoon microbial communities. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{A rapid multiplex PCR (m-PCR) method that allows the simultaneous
   detection. in a single tube, of six commonly encountered waterborne
   pathogens is developed. The target genes used were: the aerolysin (aero)
   gene of Aeromonas hydrophila, the invasion plasmid antigen H (ipaH) gene
   of Shigella flexneri, the attachment invasion locus (ail) gene of
   Yersinia enterocolitca, the invasion plasmid antigen B (ipaB) gene of
   Salmonella typhimurium. the enterotoxin extracellular secretion protein
   (epsM) gene of Vibrio cholerae and a species-specific region of the
   16S-23S rDNA (Vpara) gene of Vibrio parahaemolyticus were used as the
   gene targets. Multiplex PCR using the six pairs of primers produced
   specific amplicons of the expected sizes from mixed populations of
   reference bacterial strains in seawater and from pure cultures. The
   m-PCR assay was specific and rapid, with a turnaround time of < 12 h.
   The detection limit of the assay for the bacterial targets was estimated
   at 10(0)-10(2) cfu. Multiplex PCR analysis was performed on 19 seawater
   samples collected around Hong Kong and the results indicated significant
   levels of four bacterial pathogens at several sites where primary sewage
   wastes are discharged, and the levels of which showed no correlation
   with E. coli counts. Overall, both laboratory and field validation
   results demonstrated that the m-PCR assay developed in this study could
   provide a cost-effective and informative supplement to conventional
   microbiological methods for routine monitoring and risk assessment of
   water quality. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The microbial community structure and successive changes in a mesophilic
   ethylbenzene-degrading sulfate-reducing consortium were for the first
   time clarified by the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)
   analysis of the PCR amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments. At least ten
   bands on the DGGE gel were detected in the stationary phase.
   Phylogenetic analysis of the DGGE bands revealed that the consortium
   consisted of different eubacterial phyla including the delta subgroup of
   Proteobacteria, the order Sphingobacteriales, the order Spirochaetales,
   and the unknown bacterium, The most abundant band C was closely related
   to strain mXyS1, an in-xylene-degrading sulfate-reducing bacterium
   (SRB), and occurred as a sole band on DGGE gels in the logarithmic
   growth phase that 40\% ethylbenzene was consumed accompanied by sulfide
   production. During further prolonged incubation, the dominancy of band C
   did not change. These results suggest that SRB corresponds to the most
   abundant band C and contributes mainly to the degradation of
   ethylbenzene coupled with sulfate reduction. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This paper deals with two low-cost, locally available, renewable
   biosorbents: apple pomace and wheat straw for textile dye removal.
   Experiments at total dye concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 150,
   and 200 mg/l were carried out with a synthetic effluent consisting of an
   equal mixture of five textile dyes. The effect of initial dye
   concentration. biosorbent particle size, quantity of biosorbent,
   effective adsorbance, dye removal and the applicability of the Langmuir
   and Freundlich isotherms were examined. One gram apple pomace was found
   to be a better biosorbent. removing 81\% of dyes from the synthetic
   effluent at a particle size of 2 mm x 4 mm and 91\% at 600 mum.
   Adsorption of dyes by apple pomace occurred at a faster rate in
   comparison to wheat straw. Both the isotherms were found to be
   applicable in the case of dye adsorption using apple pomace. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Macroscopic and microscopic in-situ observation of particles and gas
   bubbles are used to get precise impressions of the hydrodynamical
   characteristics of a biologically active suspension. Moreover, values of
   in-situ velocities and particle densities can be gained by using these
   methods. The suspended anaerobic sludge revealed an extensive fibrous
   structure ('fur') on its surface. The observed microfibers have a
   profound influence on the settling, flotation behavior of the particles
   because they increase the effective particle volume, they may trap gas
   bubbles and they favor agglomeration. The biomass particles do not
   appear as single spherical objects but due to its fibrous structure oil
   the outside as strongly interacting mass. The compressibility of the
   bubbles which are entrapped in the sludge agglomerates results in a
   pressure-dependent density of the sludge particles. (C) 2002 Published

Abstract = {{The water produced during the extraction of bitumen from oil sands is
   toxic to aquatic organisms due largely to a group of naturally occurring
   organic acids, naphthenic acids (NAs), that are solubilized from the
   bitumen during processing, NAs are a complex mixture of
   alkyl-substituted acyclic and cycloaliphatic carboxylic acids, with the
   general chemical formula CnH2n+ZO2, where n is the carbon number and Z
   specifies a homologous family. Gas chromatography-electron impact mass
   spectrometry was used to characterize NAs in nine water samples derived
   from oil sands extraction processes. For each sample, the analysis
   provided the relative abundances for up to 156 base peaks, with each
   representing at least one NA structure. Plotting the relative abundances
   of NAs as three-dimensional bar graphs showed differences among samples.
   The relative abundance of NAs with carbon numbers less than or equal
   to21 to those in the ``C22 + cluster{''} (sum of all NAs with carbon
   numbers greater than or equal to 22 in Z families 0 to -12) proved
   useful for comparing the water samples that had a range of toxicities. A
   decrease in toxicity of process-affected waters accompanied an increase
   in the proportion of NAs in the ``C22 + cluster{''}, likely caused by
   biodegradation of NAs with carbon numbers of less than or equal to21. In
   addition, an increase in the proportion of NAs in the ``C22 +
   cluster{''} accompanied a decrease in the total NAs in the
   process-affected waters, again suggesting the selective removal of NAs
   with carbon numbers of less than or equal to21. This is the first
   investigation in which changes in the fingerprint of the NA fraction of
   process-affected waters from the oil sands operations has corresponded
   with measured toxicity in these waters. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{A modelling procedure with a time discretisation of 1 min is developed
   in order to study and simulate the kinetics of formation of total
   trihalomethanes (TTHM) in water treatment plants. This methodology was
   applied on two significant processing units of Athens (Galatsi Treatment
   Plant-GTP, Menidi Treatment Plant-MTP). The fundamental concept of the
   model was based on the representation of the water treatment plant as a
   mixed flow reactor. where the formation of TTHM was predicated on a
   generalised reaction of total halogens with an organic precursor.
   Differential rates of reactants and products were expressed in terms of
   the reaction stoichiometry. Volatilisation, flocculation, coagulation
   and sedimentation processes were also incorporated in the model in order
   to assess their distinct role. The most appropriate coefficient set was
   sought and it was found that a stoichiometric ratio of 0.5 for total
   halogen, 0.6 for organic substrate and 0.2 for TTHM (or 2.5:3:1)
   resulted in the best fit between simulated and experimental data. The
   present modelling approach should be considered as a promising
   methodological basis towards the realistic reproduction of the dynamics
   of water treatment plants and the development of reliable numerical
   tools for the accurate prediction of THM formation. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Profiles of resin and fatty acids (RFAs), COD, and aquatic toxicity were
   measured across the secondary treatment systems of three pulp mills. The
   RFAs sorb to suspended solids, principally fiber, and are partially
   removed through settling. An activated sludge system is more efficient
   in removing RFAs than an aerated stabilization basin (ASB) because of
   its higher solids level. Dehydroabietic acid accounts for a significant
   fraction of the effluent toxicity in the two ASBs studied. The
   microorganisms in an ASB are unable to respond rapidly to an RFA spill,
   and effluent toxicity can be elevated for a prolonged period because of
   hydraulic backmix. The applicability of several laboratory studies to
   field situations is assessed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The occurrence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was studied in river
   water, lake water, seawater and treated wastewater in Greece from
   October 1998 to September 1999. The determination of 41 VOCs was
   performed with a Purge and Trap-Gas Chroniatography-Mass Spectrometry
   method. Samples were collected seasonally from 10 rivers, seven lakes,
   three gulfs and four wastewater treatment plants. In surface water
   samples, 15 VOCs were detected. In wastewater samples, occurrence of 31
   VOCs was observed. The results suggest that not only agricultural and
   industrial activity within the Greek territory, but also transboundary
   pollution deriving from neighbouring countries consist important sources
   of VOCs in surface waters of Greece. However, the measured
   concentrations did not in any case exceed the guideline values proposed

Abstract = {{At the Saint-Caprais reservoir (France), a mono-specific bloom of
   Aphanizomenon flos-aquae occurs every year in the autumn months. Levels
   of microcystin-LR (MCYST-LR) in this reservoir were evaluated by protein
   phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) inhibition test as MCYST-LR equivalents in
   both raw and drinking water.
   Analysis by HPLC of the crude extract of the mono-specific bloom of A.
   flos-aquae revealed the presence of MCYST-LR with a low concentration of
   270.3 +/- 20.4 ng/g wet weight. MCYST-LR equivalent concentrations in
   raw water were correlated with the cyanobacteria biomass and they varied
   between 14 and 74 ng/l. The removal of A. flos-aquae and microcystins
   were evaluated in a small full-scale plant associated with the
   Saint-Caprais reservoir. Total elimination of cyanobacterial cells and
   the low concentration of hepatotoxins was achieved through the combined
   action of pre-ozonation at 0.07 mg/l and adsorption on powdered
   activated carbon at 20 mg/l. However, pre-chlorination at 0.42 mg/l
   followed by 20 mg/l of powdered activated carbon removed only 45\% of
   hepatotoxins. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the work is to study the adsorption of gallium(III) on
   bentonite from aqueous solutions. The important parameters, which affect
   the adsorption, such as pH of solution, mass of bentonite and
   temperature have been investigated. The results of parameters study
   showed that when pH and mass of bentonite increase there was a
   significant increase of Ga(III) at 20degreesC and the optimum conditions
   were as follows: pH of solution (2.50), mass of bentonite (3.50 g) and
   temperature (20degreesC). An experimental test carried out using a
   factorial design 2(3) indicated that pH and mass of bentonite have a
   positive effect, whereas temperature has negative effect. The
   interaction effect between pH and mass of bentonite was an important
   significant factor for gallium adsorption. (C) 2002 Published by

Abstract = {{It is well recognized that soluble ammonia and nitrite in drinking water
   has chronic effects on humans. Ammonia has potential environmental
   health hazards, particularly to young children. European Union Standards
   limit the concentration of ammonia to 0.5 mg/l in drinking water. In
   Eskisehir (Turkey) drinking and tap water are supplied from a water
   treatment plant, consisting mainly of screening, sedimentation,
   filtration and sterilization units and having a capacity of 80.000
   m(3)/d. Depend on the industrial and climatic effects the observed high
   ammonium concentration in treated water causes undesirable effects of
   water quality. Therefore, people in Eskisehir do not want to use tap
   water for drinking. The aim of the study was to evaluate the performance
   of membrane processes, i.e. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis to the
   removal of ammonium and Ca ions from plant effluent and recommend one of

   synthetic polyelectrolytes: cationic polyacrylamide, polyacrilic acid,
   anionic polyacrylamide and polyvinyl alcohol. Performances were measured
   under optimum conditions for the products used. They were found after
   studying the different variables which influence the process. Phosphorus
   removal is very high (approximate to 100\% for the orthophosphate and
   between 98.93\% and 99.90\% for the total phosphorus). Ammonia nitrogen
   removal is very low although appreciable performances are observed for
   albuminoid nitrogen (73.9-88.77\%). The use of coagulant aids reduces
   the volume of the sludge produced up to 41.6\%. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The low biodegradability of many dyes and textile chemicals indicates
   that biological treatment is not always successful in the treatment of
   cotton textile wastewater, in terms of color removal. In this study, a
   specific organic flocculant (Marwichem DEC), powdered activated carbon
   (PAC), bentonite, activated clay and commercial synthetic inorganic clay
   (Macrosorb) were directly added into the activated sludge laboratory
   pilot plant model. Before dosage, the optimum sludge retention time and
   hydraulic retention time were determined as 30 days and 1.6 days,
   respectively. The Monod kinetic constants were determined as Y = 0.76 kg
   MLSS/kg COD, K-d = 0.026 1/day, K-s = 113.3 mg/L, k = 0.42 1/day and
   mu(max) = 0.32 kg MLSS/kg COD day. Under these conditions the average
   COD removal was 94\% and color removal was 36\%. The addition of these
   materials did not change COD removal significantly. The most effective
   materials were found to be DEC and PAC for color removal. While the
   color removal efficiency for 120 mg/L DEC addition was 78\%, it was 65\%
   for 100 mg/L, 77\% for 200 mg/L and 86\% for 400 mg/L PAC addition.
   The advantage of DEC compared to PAC was the lower sludge production.
   Statistical analyses using multiple linear regression indicate that
   there is no relationship between the effluent color with the influent
   color and total suspended solids (TSS) for DEC and PAC addition. On the
   other hand, when only bentonite, activated clay and Macrosorb were
   added, the effluent color was primarily dependent on the influent color
   and the TSS concentration had little effect. When the data is examined
   by using Kruskal-Wallis H and Mann-Whitney U tests and it was found that
   there was a significant difference between the color data groups. (C)

Abstract = {{In order to rise efficiency of the wastewater treatment in a refinery

   wastewater was studied. Oxidation of the total petroleum hydrocarbons
   occurs at relatively low concentrations of H2O2, additional UV
   irradiation slightly accelerates the process due to the increased
   formation of hydroxyl radicals. 1,2-dichloroethane and t-butyl methyl
   ether degrade in the similar manner and except for the lowest H2O2
   concentration used (1.17 mM), the reduction after 24 h is total. The
   degradation rate for dichloromethane is the lowest one, depending both
   on hydrogen peroxide concentration and the presence of UV. Its maximum
   reduction of 83\% was obtained using the highest applied peroxide

Abstract = {{Current algal test protocols do not distinguish between chemical
   toxicity and growth inhibition due to physical shading when coloured
   substances like dyes are evaluated. To eliminate the interfering
   physical effect, we investigated the importance of light intensity and
   culture volume in the algal growth inhibition tests with Desmodesmus
   subspicatus and three selected dyestuffs. A photon flux density above
   light saturation is needed to prevent inhibition of algal growth solely
   due to the light absorption by dyes. Furthermore, a smaller culture
   volume and moderate shaking of the test flasks is advantageous in that
   these conditions decrease the influence of the light absorption. At 120
   muE s(-1) m(-2), the shading effect of three tested dyes could be
   eliminated, up to a concentration of 100 mg l(-1). In a mixture with a
   blue dyestuff, the model toxicant potassium dichromate showed nearly the
   same EC50 as if applied alone, indicating that the impact of the dye was
   negligible. Also a small culture volume decreases the inhibition of the
   average growth rate of Desmodesmus. Thus, by increasing the light
   intensity and optionally also reducing the culture volume, this method
   allows a more direct measure of a potential inherent chemical toxicity
   of coloured substances to algae. Additionally, high light intensities
   and lower culture volumes result in lower coefficients of variation,
   which improves the sensitivity of the test for the statistical
   calculation of toxicity data. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science

   L-1 in such processed drinking water. In the German waterworks already
   the rapid sand filtration diminished the SPC concentration by > 85\%.
   Subsequent subsoil passage resulted only in a slight elimination, but

Abstract = {{Surfactant and organic solvents have individually been shown useful in
   assisting the solubilization of hydrophobic organics out of contaminated
   soil and promoting UV-induced photodecay at a succeeding treatment
   process. A newly proposed process is to use the mixtures of surfactant
   and solvents together in achieving better performance. This study was to
   explore some basic variables and conditions that may be useful in
   optimizing the performance of surfactant/solvent-aided UV systems
   through the selection of surfactant micelles, the adjustment of the
   reaction pH levels, and the addition of photosensitizer and hydrogen
   sources. A PCB monomer 4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl (DCB) was used as the
   target compound for this study; about 1.3 to 2.3 times greater DCB
   photodecay rate enhancements were observed by using surfactant/acetone
   or surfactant/triethylamine (TEA) combinations at their optimal
   conditions. Overdose of these additives (acetone and TEA) will result in
   retardation of the reactions. However, the use of surfactant with a
   multi-solvents system (surfactant/acetone/TEA) shows an add-on effect in
   amplifying the overall decay rate for more than 12\%, suggesting that a
   more complicated mechanism is involved than the simple parallel-reaction
   assumption. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{By using several kinds of surface-active proteins as a chemical agent
   that combined collector with frother, removal of suspended substances by
   coagulation and foam separation with dispersed air was examined. Milk
   casein showed the greatest capability of suspension removal, and
   coagulating flocs formed by clay particles and iron hydroxide were
   almost perfectly recovered in foam generated from the liquid, even in
   the case of freshwater and seawater suspension at neutral pH. In
   contrast, the removal efficiency was extremely low using sodium dodecyl
   sulfate (SDS). Casein had a much greater capability for removing solids
   than SDS as a result of the high adsorptive activity of casein on the
   floc. For municipal wastewater treatment, the removal efficiency of
   turbidity and suspended solids was over 98\% with the condition of iron
   coagulant (FeCl3) 20 mg-Fe/L and casein 3 mg/L and pH 5-6. Moreover,
   this method proved to be an effective treatment for polluted saline
   water (salinity 1.5\%), and the suspended solids were almost perfectly
   recovered in foam. Here, we show a new method for quickly removing
   (within 7 min) suspended solids from polluted wastewater utilizing
   casein and bubbles. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reports on the results of an investigation aimed to evaluate
   the performances of an innovative tannery wastewater process based on
   the combining biological degradation, carried out in a sequencing batch
   biofilm reactor with chemical oxidation, performed by ozone. The
   combined treatment was carried out at the laboratory scale on real
   primary effluent coming from a centralised plant treating the wastewater
   from a large tanning district in Northern Italy. SBBR performances With
   and without ozonation were compared resulting to be very satisfactory
   only in the latter instance where recorded COD, NH4-N and TSS-average
   removals were 97\%, 98\% and 99.9\%, respectively. Such efficiencies
   correspond to specific concentrations in treated effluent well below the
   limit values fixed by the in-force Italian regulations. Furthermore, it
   was proved that the combined process is characterised by a very low
   sludge production. In fact, the measured specific sludge production
   (0.03 kg TSS/kg CODremoved) resulted unexpectedly much more lower than
   the value reported for conventional biological systems (i.e., 0.3-0.5 kg
   TSS/kg CODremoved). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Humic acid (HA) is one of natural organics existing in water supply as a
   precursor of trihalomethanes formation in chlorination. The
   photo-degradation of HA in aqueous solution by photoelectrocatalytic
   (PEC) oxidation using a Ti/TiO2 mesh electrode was investigated in terms
   of UV absorbance at 254 nm, colour and TOC concentration. The key
   factors affecting the PEC oxidation efficiency were studied, including
   the concentration of electrolyte, electrical bias applied, pH value of
   HA solution, the intensity of incident light and the area of Ti/TiO2
   mesh photoelectrodes. The first-order kinetic model was applied to
   describe the PEC oxidation, in which the kinetic constant k was verified
   by the experimental data as a function of the concentration of
   electrolyte, light intensity, the area of Ti/TiO2 mesh electrode and the
   voltage of electrical bias applied. It was found that there was an
   optimal bias voltage of 1.63 V and low pH value was favourable for TOC
   removal in HA solution. Our investigation showed that PEC oxidation was
   a convenient way to mineralise the organic matters with high efficiency.

Abstract = {{The treatment of domestic sewage at low temperature of 13degreesC was
   investigated in a two-step system consisting of an anaerobic filter (AF)
   + an anaerobic hybrid (AH) reactor operated at different hydraulic
   retention times (HRTs). The AF reactor was efficient in the removal of
   suspended COD, viz. 81\%, 58\% and 57\% at an HRT of, respectively, 4, 2
   and 3 h. For optimisation of the removal of suspended COD and dissolved
   COD, an HRT of 4 + 4 h is required for the AF + AH system. For
   additional optimisation of colloidal COD removal, the AH reactor needs
   an HRT of 8 h. The AF + AH system operated at an HRT of 4 + 8 h at
   13degreesC provided a high removal efficiency for all COD fractions. The
   achieved total COD removal was as high as 71\% which is similar to
   values found in tropical areas. Moreover, 60\% of the removed COD was
   converted to methane. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Peat generally has a high adsorption capacity and has been suggested as
   an adsorbent for metals in polluted waters. However, the adsorption
   potential of peat can be expected to be strongly dependent on the
   chemical properties of the water. In this study, the effect of pH, ionic
   strength (CaCl2 and NaCl concentrations), and metal concentration on Cu
   and Zn adsorption onto poorly humified Sphagnum and Carex peat was
   investigated in batch experiments using a fractional factorial
   experimental design. The pH value was varied between 4 and 8, the CaCl2
   and NaCl concentrations between 1.2-6.2 and 0.4-43 mM, respectively, and
   the Cu and Zn concentrations between 0.05 and 0.5 mM. The amount of Zn
   adsorbed increased more with increasing pH than the amount of Cu
   adsorbed. The effect of NaCl/CaCl2 concentration was minor. It was found
   that Zn adsorption in particular, but also Cu adsorption, increased more
   with pH onto Carex peat than onto Sphagnum peat. In the pH interval 4-8,
   the removal of Zn from the solution increased from 0\% to 80\% using
   Carex peat and from 10\% to 65\% using Sphagnum peat as the adsorbent.
   The Carex peat sample decreased the Cu concentration by 80\% at pH 4 and
   by 95\% at pH 8 and for Sphagnum peat a decrease of 85\% was maintained
   in the pH range investigated. The differences between Sphagnum and Carex
   peat were attributed to the habitat conditions at the time of peat
   formation. Carex peat has higher ash, nitrogen and sulphur
   concentrations, while Sphagnum peat contains a higher amount of uronic
   acid.
   In treating polluted waters with peat, a higher degree of metal removal
   can be expected at high pH values than at low. The removal of Cu, which
   has a high affinity to the peat surface, was less dependent on pH than
   Zn removal. Poorly humified Carex peat should be chosen in treating
   wastewaters high in pH. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This research investigated the oxygen-generating characteristics and
   side reactions of an electrolytic cell assembly that could be used to
   remediate sites with contaminants that are amenable to aerobic
   biodegradation. The oxygen-generating capabilities of new electrolytic
   cells and cells with light and heavy calcium carbonate precipitates on
   the cathode were evaluated in the laboratory under current densities
   ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 mA/cm(2). Higher current densities resulted in
   higher mass transfer coefficients (K(L)a) and greater saturation oxygen
   concentrations (C-sat). As the cathodic deposits increased, the K(L)a
   tended to decrease and the C-sat tended to increase. The oxygen transfer
   efficiency (OTE) did not vary as a function of current density or
   cathode coating, while the average OTE for all the tests was 67\%.
   Laboratory column tests showed that chlorine production increased with
   current density and depended on chloride levels in the water. Hydrogen
   peroxide was generated at low concentrations (< 1 mg/L) and at higher
   levels when chloride was absent in the feed solution. Calcium removal
   from Solution increased with current density and resulted in a decrease
   in solution pH. Tests at a field monitoring well showed average C-sat
   levels of 16.9 mg/L after 14 days of operation, no chlorine production
   because of low chloride levels in the well, artificially elevated
   hydrogen peroxide levels because of background interferences, and a pH
   decrease of 2.4 units. With passive venting, the average hydrogen gas
   levels at the headspace of the well were less than 1\%. (C) 2002

Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2255-2264}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Organic polyelectrolytes are utilized extensively in wastewater
   treatment, but their fate after use is poorly understood. Analytical
   methods used for polymer determination in less complex systems appear to
   fail in application to wastewater systems, contributing to the lack of
   knowledge. Thus, the development of H-1 NMR spectroscopy is reported
   here for specifically quantitating certain cationic flocculant polymers
   in environmental samples. Proton observe frequencies of 250 or 400 MHz
   proton were used. A copolymer of acrylamide and
   acryloyloxyethyltrimethylammonium chloride was used, representative of
   cationic flocculant polymers possessing quaternary ammonium groups with
   terminal methyls that provide a sharp singlet at a chemical shift of
   approximate to3.06 ppm. A strong linear relationship was demonstrated
   between polymer concentration and either height or area of this peak.
   Recoveries were up to 96\% at higher concentrations (250 mg/L), and were
   greater than when using viscosity or charge titration methods for
   polymer determination. Lesser recoveries at lower concentrations (70\%
   at 5 mg/L) were attributed to adsorptive losses. The detection limit of
   this method was determined to be <0.5 mg/L. Use of the method was
   exemplified by analysis of anaerobically digested sludges for residual
   polymer following a range of dosages, showing the resulting isotherm.

Abstract = {{Since trophic status assessment of water quality is very important for
   the water resources management, the assessment results obtained from
   using only one parameter may easily mislead or bias the decision makers
   or managers. Even when using a multivariable index, how to determine the
   weights of all factors is debatable. In this research, one complementary
   evaluation method, self-organizing map (SOM), for diagnosing water
   quality has been used to develop a trophic state classifier and is
   illustrated with a case study of trophic status assessment for Fei-Tsui
   Reservoir in Taiwan. The historical database was collected from the
   management agency of Fei-Tsui Reservoir from 1987 to 1995. The results
   of SOM are compared with those of the Carlson index and Fuzzy synthetic
   evaluation, showing that the inconsistent records can be mapped to the
   conflicting data zone of the SOM output map. In addition, SOM creates a
   diagnostic axis on the map to express the trophic status of the water
   body. As long as the SOM model is well-trained, new records can be
   assessed and classified as either one of three trophic levels or special
   cases. If special water quality conditions are expressed on the SOM
   output, those data can reveal that either total phosphorus (TP) or
   chlorophyll A (chl a) is higher than usual. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A quinoline-biodegrading microorganism was isolated from activated
   sludge of coke-oven wastewater treatment plant using quinoline as sole
   carbon and nitrogen source. It is a gram negative, rod-shaped and
   aerobic strain, which was identified as Burkholderia pickettii. The
   biodegradation of quinoline was carried out with this isolated strain.
   Analysis by high performance liquid chromatography and gas
   chromatography/mass spectrum (GC/MS) revealed that 2-hydroxyquinoline
   (2-OH-Q) was the first intermediate in the course of quinoline
   biodegradation. A novel immobilization carrier, that is, polyvinyl
   alcohol (PVA)-gauze hybrid carrier, was developed, The isolated strain
   was immobilized by two different immobilizing techniques and used for
   the quinoline degradation. It was found that biodegradation rate of
   quinoline by the microorganisms immobilized on PVA-gauze hybrid carrier
   was faster than that by the microorganisms immobilized in PVA gel beads.
   Kinetics of quinoline biodegradation by cells of Burkholderia pickettii
   immobilized on PVA-gauze hybrid carrier was investigated. The results
   demonstrate that quinoline degradation could be described by zero-order
   reaction rate equation when the initial quinoline concentration was in
   the range of 50-500 mg l(-1). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The use of low-cost activated carbon derived from bagasse, an
   agricultural waste material, has been investigated as a replacement for
   the current expensive methods of removing heavy metals from wastewater,
   With a view to find a suitable application of the material, activated
   carbon has been derived, characterized and utilized for the removal of
   cadmium and zinc. The uptake of cadmium was found to be slightly greater
   than that of zinc and the sorption capacity increases with increase in
   temperature. The adsorption studies were carried out both in single- and
   multi-component systems. Adsorption data on derived carbon follows both
   the Freundlich and Langinuir models. The data are better fitted by the
   Freundlich isotherm as compared to Langmuir in both the single- and
   multi-component systems. Isotherms have been used to obtain the
   thermodynamic parameters. The kinetics of adsorption depends on the
   adsorbate concentration and the physical and chemical characteristics of
   the adsorbent. Studies were conducted to delineate the effect of
   temperature, initial adsorbate concentration, particle size of the
   adsorbent and solid-to-liquid ratio. On the basis of these studies,
   various parameters such as mass transfer coefficient, effective
   diffusion coefficient, activation energy and entropy of activation were
   evaluated to establish the mechanisms. It was concluded that the
   adsorption occurs through a film diffusion mechanism at low as well as
   at higher concentrations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The antioxidant 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-toluene (BHT) is widely used
   as an additive to increase the tenability of food and plastics. BHT is
   degraded to 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (BHT-CHO) in
   mammals, as well as in the natural environment such as in water and
   soils. BHT-CHO has been studied extensively in terms of their potential
   toxicities. The present investigation was carried out to quantify BHT
   and BHT-CHO in river, ground, rain and drinking water obtained from
   several locations in Germany. Apart from the compounds mentioned above,
   1,2-bis-(3,5-di-tertbutyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane (2-BHT), which is a
   dimer of BHT, was also detected in the extracts of some ground water
   samples. The applied analytical method is based on solid phase
   extraction (SPE) to concentrate trace compounds from water samples
   followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of the
   extracts. A total of 51 of the respective water samples were used for
   extraction purposes and analyte recoveries were all greater than or
   equal to80\%. The determination limit for BHT was 5 ng l(-1) and for
   BHT-CHO 16 ng l(-1). The standard deviations for the analytical
   procedure were 6\% for BHT and 10\% for BHT-CHO.
   The use of the antioxidant BHT in Germany has resulted in water
   concentrations of 7-791 ng l(-1) in the rivers Rhine, Elbe, Main, Oder,
   Nidda and Schwarzbach. The degradation product BHT-CHO was also detected
   in the river water samples at concentrations between 29 and 223 ng
   l(-1). The concentrations of BHT measured in German rivers are lower
   compared to values measured in the USA and Japan 20 years ago. In ground
   water, levels for BHT varied from nondetectable up to 2156 ng l(-1) and
   for BHT-CHO from non-detectable up to 674 ng l(-1). Both compounds were
   also detected in rain water in Frankfurt/Main at a concentration of 1797
   ng l(-1) for BHT and 59ngl-1 for BHT-CHO. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The paper describes the influence of the oxidation of natural organic
   matter (NOM) molecules with chlorine dioxide (ClO2) on granulated
   activated carbon (GAC) adsorption. In order to determinate the influence
   of ClO2 dosage on the NOM adsorption on GAC two parallel pilot scale
   experiments were performed. The raw water was treated respectively with
   0.2 and 0.4 mg ClO2 L-1 followed by the adsorption on GAC filters.
   Experiments were total organic carbon (TOC) measurements and size
   exclusion chromatography (SEC) controlled. The molecular weight
   distribution of NOM in the filtration bed outlet demonstrates that the
   low molecular weight molecules are less retained than the higher
   molecular weight components of NOM. It is shown that low molecular
   weight NOM causes less ClO2 demand. The oxidation of NOM molecules and
   very high capacity of GAC filter bed for NOM components can be used to
   control high ClO2, demand. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We describe the transient-state, multiple-species biofilm model
   (TSMSBM), which is a novel synthesis of key modeling features needed to
   describe multiple-species biofilms that experience time-varying
   conditions, particularly including periodic detachment by backwashing.
   The TSMSBM includes six features that are essential for describing
   multiple-species biofilms that undergo changes over time: (1) four
   biomass types: heterotrophs, ammonia oxidizers, nitrite oxidizers, and
   inert biomass; (2) seven chemical species: input biodegradable organic
   material (BOM), NH(4)(+)-N, NO(2)(-)-N, NO(3)(-)-N,
   utilization-associated products, biomass-associated products, and
   dissolved oxygen; (3) eight reactions that describe the rates of
   consumption or production of the different species, as well as the
   stoichiometric linkages among the rates; (4) reaction with diffusion of
   all the soluble species in the biofilm; (5) growth, decay, detachment,
   and flux of each biomass type by location in the biofilm; and (6)
   constant or periodic detachment of biofilm, both of which allow for
   protection of biomass deep inside the biofilm. The last two features of
   the TSMSBM provide novel additions to biofilm modeling, and the
   synthesis of all features is a unique advancement. A series of examples
   illustrates insights that the TSMSBM can provide about the transient
   development of multiple-species biofilms; the roles of soluble microbial
   products and detachment in controlling the distribution of biomass types
   and process performance; and how backwashing affects the biofilm in
   drinking-water biofiltration. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Title = {{A comparison of surface water natural organic matter in raw filtered
   water samples, XAD, and reverse osmosis isolates}},

Abstract = {{This research compared raw filtered waters (RFWs), XAD resin isolates
   (XAD-8 and XAD-4), and reverse osmosis (RO) isolates of several surface
   water samples from McDonalds Branch, a smali freshwater fen in the New
   Jersey Pine Barrens (USA). RO and XAD-8 are two of the most common
   techniques used to isolate natural organic matter (NOM) for studies of
   composition and reactivity; therefore, it is important to understand how
   the isolates differ from bulk (unisolated) samples and from one another.
   Although, any comparison between the isolation methods needs to consider
   that XAD-8 is specifically designed to isolate the humic fraction,
   whereas RO concentrates a broad range of organic matter and is not
   specific to humics. The comparison included for all samples weight
   average molecular weight (Mw), number average molecular weight (M(n)),
   polydispersity (rho), absorbance at 280 nm normalized to moles C
   (epsilon(280)) (RFW and isolates); and for isolates only: elemental
   analysis, \% carbon distribution by (13)C NMR, and aqueous FTIR spectra.
   As expected, RO isolation gave higher yield of NOM than XAD-8, but also
   higher ash content, especially Si and S. M,, decreased in the order: RO
   > XAD-8 > RFW > XAD-4. The M(w) differences of isolates compared with
   RFW may be due to selective isolation (fractionation), or possibly in
   the case of RO to condensation or coagulation during isolation. (13)C
   NMR results were roughly similar for the two methods, but the XAD-8
   isolate was slightly higher in `aromatic' C and the RO isolate was
   slightly higher in heteroaliphatic and carbonyl C. Infrared spectra
   indicated a higher carboxyl content for the XAD-8 isolates and a higher
   ester:carboxyl ratio for the RO isolates. The spectroscopic data thus
   are consistent with selective isolation of more hydrophobic compounds by
   XAD-8, and also with potential ester hydrolysis during that process,
   although further study is needed to determine whether ester hydrolysis
   does indeed occur. Researchers choosing between XAD and RO isolation
   methods for NOM need to consider first the purpose of the isolation;
   i.e., whether humic fractionation is desirable. Beyond that, they should
   consider the C yield and ash content, as well as the potential for
   alteration of NOM by ester hydrolysis (XAD) or condensation/coa.gulation
   (RO). Furthermore, the RO and XAD methods produce different fractions or
   isolates so that researchers should be careful when comparing the
   compositions and reactivities of NOM samples isolated by these two
   different techniques., (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The chemistry of a limed lake and its main tributaries were studied for
   3 years (1992-94) with an emphasis on natural organic matter (NOM).
   Increased transparency and decreased water colour indicated a general
   reduction of NOM in the lake. Increased A(254nm)/A(410nm) ratios in the
   epilimnion during summer and early autumn suggested degradation of
   higher molecular size organic matter into low molecular size NOM.
   Increase in ammonium and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations in
   the lake was possibly due to the NOM degradation. Using budget
   calculations and the literature values, photodegradation and microbial
   activity were estimated to be the main mechanisms of the NOM removal.
   These mechanisms accounted for about 30-35\% and 60-65\% of the total
   loss of organic matter, respectively, in the summer and early autumn
   period. Low sedimentation rates indicate that co-precipitation of
   organic matter with calcium, aluminium and/or iron was of minor
   importance in these seasons. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Direct viable counts (DVC) of bacteria were quantified from polluted and
   relatively less/non-polluted coastal locations during different seasons
   to assess whether they can be routinely monitored for an understanding
   of environmental stress(es) that may impede the full functioning of
   bacterial communities in situ. Most notably, DVC were quite low during
   pre-monsoon (March-May) in pollution-affected locations when compared to
   relatively less/nonpolluted ones. In contrast, their abundance was
   significantly higher (up to or > 10 \%) suggesting a substantially
   higher microbial activity (thus, a larger turnover of organic matter)
   during monsoon (June-September) and post-monsoon (October-February) even
   in pollution-affected locations. The ease of reliably measuring DVC was
   useful in realising decreased metabolic functioning of bacteria during
   pre-monsoon, a season where dispersion of land discharges/effluents is
   much lower. From laboratory and field analyses of this study it is
   ascertained that DVC are direct indices of potential bacterial metabolic
   activity, reliable for sensing metabolic stress experienced by bacterial
   communities in situ and can be useful for evaluating risks in marine
   environment through human (industrial) activities. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Metal adsorption and surface charge determinations were performed
   previously on well-characterised Sphagnum and Carex peat samples. The
   aim of this investigation was to determine metal adsorption from complex
   wastewaters onto these peat samples and compare it to the adsorption
   onto peat granules, clinoptilolite, glauconite and a flue dust from
   steel production. A sulphide mine leachate, a landfill leachate and a
   laundry wastewater were chosen, giving a variation in pH, ionic
   strength, total organic carbon and concentrations of metals. Metal
   adsorption was determined in batch and column experiments. The
   wastewater composition was of great importance for metal removal
   efficiency, mainly due to the difference in dominating metal species. In
   the sulphide mine leachate, containing free metal ions, a high metal
   adsorption was observed onto both peat and inorganic adsorbents. In the
   landfill leachate the metals formed carbonate and organic complexes and
   a low metal removal was achieved. Contrary to the leachates, the laundry
   wastewater contained suspended particles. The high amount of metals
   removed, 80\% of the Cu and 30-60\% of the Zn concentration, was
   probably withdrawn bound to the particle fraction. The highest removal
   of metal ions was obtained in the sulphide mine leachate with Carex
   peat, removing 97-99\% of the Zn and 85-100\% of the Cu content. The
   Sphagnum peat sample removed 37-77\% of the Zn and 80-100\% of the Cu
   content. The differences found between Sphagnum and Carex peat were
   attributed to the original chemistry of the plant material and the
   habitat conditions at the time of peat formation. Generally, the
   combination of glauconite or clinoptilolite with the peat samples in
   column experiments gave a minor improvement in metal removal. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{A distributed model of anaerobic digestion of solid waste was developed
   to study effects of mass transfer on the rate of propagation of
   initiation methanogenic area. The diffusion and advection of volatile
   fatty acids (VFA) and methanogenic biomass were taken into account in
   the model of a one-dimensional (1D) reactor. It was considered that VFA
   inhibits both polymer hydrolysis and acetoclastic methanogenesis. This
   approach allows to view the bioreactor as an active medium that provokes
   concentration waves from some area of methanogenic initiation (local VFA
   depression) to the total reactor volume. The model shows that mass
   transfer-based acceleration of methane production in the reactor is
   possible when the intensity of VFA utilization in the methanogenic area
   is sufficient for a complete digestion of the incoming VFA, Otherwise,
   initiation methanogenic area will be suppressed by increasing
   concentration of VFA. The obtained results emphasize the importance of
   considering spatial heterogeneity of the reaction for the analysis of
   solid anaerobic digestion in bioreactors and landfills. The digestion of
   solid waste can be optimized by setting the low rate of mass transfer
   (mixing or leachate recirculation) during lag-phase of the reaction with
   subsequent increase in the mass transfer rate in parallel with the
   propagation of methanogenic population, In this case, the rate of
   concentration waves substantially increases. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{We have undertaken simple proof of principle experiments to find out if

   = 0.007). The thermal-film reactor had the greatest effect
   (approximately 27\% of the seed) and was statistically distinguishable
   from the sol-gel reactor and the controls. The sol-gel reactor showed an
   increase in oocyst permeability, but was not statistically
   distinguishable from one of the controls. The enhanced performance of
   the thermal film reactor is attributed to the superior conversion of
   photochemical holes to hydroxyl radicals at the surface of this

   Chitosan effectively reduces turbidity due to silt by flocculation and
   settling. Flocculation efficiency is very sensitive to pH, and reaches a
   maximum at pH 7. The optimal chitosan concentration required to effect
   flocculation is 0.5 mg/L and is independent of silt concentration within
   the range examined. Restabilisation of the suspension is observed at
   higher concentrations of chitosan, and the amount required for
   restabilisation increases with increasing concentration of suspended
   solids. Flocculation is faster at higher concentrations of silt and the
   flocs are large and fibrous. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A small, well-defined watershed was investigated over a 2-year period to
   determine the prevalence of F-specific RNA coliphage (F + RNA) serotypes
   as indicators of animal fecal contamination. Sampling sites collected
   runoff from areas of urban and agricultural land use patterns.
   F-specific coliphages were concentrated from 2-L freshwater samples by
   polyethylene glycol precipitation, isolated using the double agar layer
   (DAL) method, confirmed as F + RNA by RNAse suppression, and serotyped.
   A subset of serotyped F+ RNA were confirmed by genotyping. To determine
   relative survival, 10 confirmed F +RNA field isolates and 5 prototypic F
   +RNA were spiked into surface water and incubated at 25degreesC for 36
   days. F-specific coliphage isolation was strongly associated with
   rainfall events and was infrequent from primarily animal impacted
   surface waters. Field isolates were predominantly Type I F + RNA (81 \%)
   and raw sewage isolates were predominantly Type III F + RNA (57 \%).
   Genotyping from either the watershed or raw sewage samples never
   positively identified Type IV F + RNA. Results from laboratory studies
   showed that F + RNA differ in their survival in water and that Type IV
   strains were the least persistent. Type III F + RNA were found to be
   reliably related to the release of uncontrolled human fecal material in
   the watershed, but the results of this study suggest that further study
   is required before utilizing for fecal source identification in natural
   waters. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A study of the benthic macroinvertebrates of a fourth order stream in
   Southern Nigeria was carried out to assess the ecological impact of
   impoundment. Three stations 1, 2, and 3 were selected from upstream of
   the impoundment, the impoundment (reservoir) and its downstream,
   respectively. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in the
   values of the physical and chemical parameters between the upstream and
   downstream stations. Water level, transparency, current velocity and
   dissolved oxygen were, however, significantly lower within the
   reservoir. The total number of benthic macroinvertebrate taxa, and their
   overall density were significantly higher in the control station
   (upstream) than within the reservoir and the downstream station. The
   density of the three dominant taxonomic groups, Diptera, Oligochaeta and
   Ephemeroptera differed significantly (P < 0.05) among the stations.
   While chironomid dipterans dominated the up- and downstream stations,
   Oligochaeta was dominant in the reservoir. The density of Ephemeroptera
   was significantly reduced within the reservoir and the downstream
   station. Analysis of faunal similarities showed that the upstream
   station 1 was significantly different from stations 2 and 3. Stream
   impoundment, therefore, alters not only the river hydrology but also the
   faunal characteristics of downstream stations. This study further
   strengthens the viewpoint that river management consideration should be
   implemented to lessen the impact on the downstream ecology. Furthermore,
   when considering impounding a river, the ecological implication must
   also be considered. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Quality of groundwater is controlled by many factors amongst which the
   interaction of river water with adjacent groundwater and
   mixing/non-mixing of different types of groundwater may be important. An
   attempt has been made to study these processes using multivariate
   statistical techniques such as factor and cluster analyses. The
   Nethravathi catchment (India) which is a tropical river basin draining
   the Precambrian crystalline province of peninsular India, has been
   selected for this study. Hydrogeochemical data for 56 groundwater
   samples were subjected to Q- and R- mode factor and cluster analysis.
   R-mode analysis reveals the inter-relations among the variables studied
   and the Q-mode analysis reveals the inter-relations among the samples
   studied. The R-mode factor analysis shows that Na and Cl with HCO3
   account for most of the electrical conductivity and total dissolved
   solids of the groundwater. The `single dominance' nature of the majority
   of the factors in the R-mode analysis indicates non-mixing or partial
   mixing of different types of groundwater. Both Q-mode factor and Q-mode
   cluster analyses shows that there is an exchange between the river water
   and the adjacent groundwater. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of the introduction of Pseudomonas putida CP1 to a commercial
   mixed microbial community for the degradation of 1.56 mM 2-chlorophenol
   was investigated. Degradation of 2-chlorophenol by the commercial
   mixture was via a meta-cleavage pathway leading to incomplete
   degradation, while P. putida CP1 was shown to be capable of the complete
   degradation of 2-chlorophenol via an ortho-cleavage pathway.
   Augmentation of the commercial mixed culture with P. putida CP1 resulted
   in complete degradation of 2-chlorophenol via an ortho-cleavage pathway.
   The augmented mixed culture displayed increased degradative
   capabilities, with times of degradation reduced when compared to those
   achieved by P. putida CP1 in isolation. The ability of P. putida CP1 to
   degrade 2-chlorophenol was increased with the addition of increasing
   concentrations of the mixed culture. Increasing the mixed culture
   inoculum size added to P. putida CP1 decreased lag periods and increased
   rates of degradation, resulting in decreased times of degradation. (C)

Abstract = {{An investigation was carried out for a variety of different sewage
   sludges in order to establish correlations between sludge composition,
   structure and dewatering properties. Results indicated that the fraction
   of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in sludges was the most
   important parameter with respect to sludge structure. With high EPS
   contents, sludges had a lower shear sensitivity and lower degree of
   dispersion. This in turn lead to better filterability in terms of low
   resistance to filtration (SRF). The floc stabilising role of EPS
   components was not consistent with DLVO-theory, as the zeta-potential
   increased with increased EPS content due to increased EPS charge
   content. This indicates that polymer entanglement is a key factor to
   stable floc structure. This does not rule out the possible change in
   dispersion due to changed electrostatic repulsion for a given EPS
   content. While EPS had a good effect on floc stability and
   filterability, the cake dry matter content decreased with large EPS
   contents. This could be due to an osmotic pressure related to the
   polymer charge quantity, or it could be caused by water entrapment in
   the floc structures. A high degree of sludge dispersion increased the
   cake dry matter content in filtration. This mechanism is, however,
   impractical due to high SRF and not important to conditioned sludge. In
   practice, dewatering also includes sludge expression. Taking this into
   account, osmosis related to EPS charges is likely to be increasingly
   important (increasing the negative effect of EPS content on cake dry
   matter). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental investigation on the removal of cadmium ions from aqueous
   solutions by chitin was conducted in batch conditions. Kinetic data and
   equilibrium removal isotherms were measured. The influence of different
   experimental parameters such as time contact, initial concentration of
   cadmium, chitin mass, particles size, agitation speed, temperature and
   the nature of cadmium salt, on the kinetics of cadmium removal was
   studied. The main parameters that play an important part in removal
   phenomenon were initial cadmium concentration, particle size and chitin
   mass. Other parameters such as agitation speed, temperature and the
   nature of cadmium salt, showed a restricted effect on the removal
   kinetics. The process follows a pseudo second-order kinetics. The
   cadmium uptake of chitin was quantitatively evaluated using sorption
   isotherms. In order to describe the isotherm mathematically, the
   experimental data of the removal equilibrium were correlated by either
   the Langmuir or Freundlich equations. Results indicated that the
   Langmuir model gave a better fit to the experimental data than the
   Freundlich equation. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with a X-ray
   energy dispersed analysis for cadmium-equilibrated chitin, demonstrated
   that cadmium-containing nodules existed on the surface chitin. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The microbiology and the feasibility of a new, single-stage, reactor for
   completely autotrophic ammonia removal were investigated. The reactor
   was started anoxically after inoculation with biomass from a reactor
   performing anaerobic ammonia oxidation (Anammox). Subsequently, oxygen
   was supplied to the reactor and a nitrifying population developed.
   Oxygen was kept as the limiting factor. The development of a nitrifying
   population was monitored by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization and
   off-line activity measurements. These methods also showed that during
   steady state, anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria remained present and
   active. In the reactor, no aerobic nitrite-oxidizers were detected. The
   denitrifying potential of the biomass was below the detection limit.
   Ammonia was mainly converted to N(2) (85\%) and the remainder (15\%) was
   recovered as NO(3)(-). N(2)O production was negligible (less than
   0.1\%). Addition of an external carbon source was not needed to realize
   the autotrophic denitrification to N(2). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The bagasse fly ash, obtained from the local sugar industry, has been
   used as inexpensive and effective adsorbent for the removal of lindane
   and malathion from wastewater. The optimum contact needed to reach
   equilibrium was found to be 60 min. Maximum removal takes place at pH
   6.0. The removal of the pesticides increases with an increase in
   adsorbent dose and decreases with adsorbent particle size. The optimum
   adsorbent dose is 5 g/l of particle size 200250 pm. Removal of the two
   pesticides was achieved up to 97-98\% under optimum conditions. The
   material exhibits good adsorption capacity and follows both Langmuir and
   Freundlich models. Thermodynamic parameters also indicate the
   feasibility of the process. The adsorption was found to be exothermic in
   nature. At lower concentrations, adsorption is controlled by film
   diffusion, while at higher concentrations, it is controlled by particle
   diffusion mechanisms. The adsorbent is a very useful and economic
   product for the removal of lindane and malathion. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Trace metals, PCB congeners and DDT homologues were determined in
   composite sediment samples collected from 10 representative sites along
   the river Po in two separate seasons. The aim was to identify the most
   anthropogenically impacted areas for future monitoring programmes and to
   aid development of Italian sediment quality criteria. The surface
   samples were collected during low flow conditions. Trace metal
   concentrations were assayed by electrothermal (Cd Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb),
   flame (Fe, Mn, Zn) or hydride generation (As) atomic absorption
   spectrometry after microwave assisted acid digestion. Hg was determined
   on solid samples by automated analyser. Organic microcontaminants were
   determined by gas-chromatography with 63 Ni electron capture detector
   after Soxhlet extraction. Concentrations of trace metals, total PCB and
   DDT homologues showed two distinct peaks at the sites immediately
   downstream of Turin and Milan, respectively, and in each case decreased
   progressively further downstream. Principal component analysis
   identified three major factors (from a multi-dimensional space of 35
   variables) which explained 85-90\% of the total observed variance. The
   first and second factors corresponded to anthropogenic inputs and
   geological factors on sediment quality; the third included seasonal
   processes of minor importance. Sediment quality assessment identified
   Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, Zn and organic microcontaminants as posing the most
   serious threats to river sediment quality. A reference site within the
   Po basin provided Useful background values. Moderate pollution by
   organochlorine compounds was ascribed both to local Sources and to
   atmospheric deposition. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A method was developed for the quantitative detection of pathogenic
   human enteroviruses from surface waters in the Florida Keys using Taqman
   (R) one-step Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with the Model 7700 ABI
   Prism (R) Sequence Detection System. Viruses were directly extracted
   from unconcentrated grab samples of seawater, from seawater concentrated
   by vortex flow filtration using a 100 kD filter and from sponge tissue.
   Total RNA was extracted from the samples, purified and concentrated
   using spin-column chromatography. A 192-196 base pair portion of the 5'
   untranscribed region was amplified from these extracts. Enterovirus
   concentrations were estimated using real-time RTPCR technology. Nine of
   15 sample sites or 60\% were positive for the presence of pathogenic
   human enteroviruses. Considering only near-shore sites, 69\% were
   positive with viral concentrations ranging from 9.3 viruses/ml to 83
   viruses/g of sponge tissue (uncorrected for extraction efficiency).
   Certain amplicons were selected for cloning and sequencing for
   identification. Three strains of waterborne enteroviruses were
   identified as Coxsackievirus A9, Coxsackievirus A16, and Poliovirus
   Sabin type 1. Time and cost efficiency of this one-step real-time RT-PCR
   methodology makes this an ideal technique to detect, quantitate and
   identify pathogenic enteroviruses in recreational waters. (C) 2002

   interval observer on a I m 3 continuous fixed bed anaerobic reactor used
   for the treatment of industrial wine distillery wastewater. This
   interval observer is able to generate guaranteed intervals for the
   unmeasured variables (i.e. acidogenic and methanogenic bacteria,
   alkalinity and chemical oxygen demand) from few on-line measurements
   (i.e. input liquid flow rate, CO2 gaseous flow rate, volatile fatty
   acids and total inorganic carbon). The main advantage of this approach
   is its independance with respect to disturbances and uncertainty in the

Abstract = {{The reaction mechanisms and rates of trichloroethene (TCE) photodecay in
   the presence of photosensitizer (acetone, ACE) and hydrogen sources
   (surfactant and triethylamine, TEA) were investigated. Quantum yields of
   TCE photodecay in solution with surfactant Brij 35 and optimal ACE
   dosage are about 25 times higher than in Brij 35 alone. However, with an
   excess ACE dosage, ACE will act as a light barrier and attenuate the
   light intensity available for TCE photodegradation. TCE photodegradation
   follows a two-stage kinetics, in which a lag-phase is followed by a fast
   decay. The lag-phase distribution depends on initial pH levels and ACE
   concentrations. The overall TCE removal was found to be higher at high
   pH level, suggesting that free radical reaction is dominant at high pH
   levels. The use of additional hydrogen source (TEA) in the reaction can
   further accelerate the reaction, but overdosing of TEA would quench the
   reaction. The possible reaction mechanisms of TCE photodecay involving
   ACE and TEA were proposed, and rate-enhancing and rate-quenching models
   at low and high TEA concentrations respectively were derived based on
   the proposed mechanism; they were found useful for predicting the TEC
   decay quantum yields. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine) is a nitramine explosive
   that has contaminated soil and groundwater at military installations
   throughout the US. Although anaerobic RDX metabolism has been reported,
   the process is not well understood, as past studies have typically
   involved complex, undefined media with multiple potential electron
   donors and acceptors. In this study, bacteria enriched from
   RDX-contaminated aquifer sediments consumed RDX in a defined,
   bicarbonate-buffered, anaerobic medium containing hydrogen as the sole
   electron donor and RDX as a potential electron acceptor and sole
   nitrogen source. RDX was not consumed in live controls that did not
   contain hydrogen. Transient formation of mononitroso- and dinitroso-RDX
   metabolites (hexahydro-1-nitroso-3,5-dinitro-1,3,5-triazine and
   hexahydro-1,3-dinitroso-5-nitro-1,3,5-triazine, respectively) was
   documented by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. However, studies
   with C-14-labeled RDX suggested that mineralization to carbon dioxide
   was negligible (<2\%), which is consistent with cometabolic
   transformation. Several lines of evidence suggest that the
   RDX-transforming bacteria under study were homoacetogens, including
   correlations between RDX consumption and acetate production. Methanogens
   were unlikely to be responsible for RDX metabolism, as the presence of
   2-bromoethanesulfonate, an inhibitor of methanogenesis, did not appear
   to affect RDX metabolism. The presence of nitrate reversibly halted RDX
   metabolism, whereas ammonium had no discernible effect, which implies
   that: (i) nitrate, which commonly occurs in RDX-contaminated
   groundwater, may inhibit in situ RDX metabolism, and (ii) although RDX
   may act as both a nitrogen source and cometabolic electron sink, the
   latter role predominates, as RDX reduction will proceed regardless of
   whether or not a more favorable nitrogen source is present. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Partial nitrification to nitrite was reported to be technically feasible
   and economically favourable, especially when wastewater with high
   ammonium concentrations or low C/N ratios are treated. Nitritation can
   be obtained by selectively inhibiting nitrite oxidizing microrganisms
   through appropriate regulation of the system's pH, temperature, and
   sludge retention time. In addition to already known methods, the work
   showed that aeration patterns may play a relevant role too.
   Nitrification tests were performed in two lab-scale reactors operated
   under continuous and intermittent aeration, respectively. In both
   plants, temperature was maintained at 32degreesC and pH was regulated at
   7.2 by providing external buffer capacity when needed. The results
   showed that partial nitrification to nitrite was steadily obtained under
   oxygen limitation, independent of the sludge age. Therefore, the
   aeration pattern is proposed as an alternative parameter to the sludge
   retention time for controlling ammonium oxidation to nitrite. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Changes in monochlorodimedone (MCD) chlorinating rates with free
   chlorine (mixture of HOCl and OCl-) and ammonia monochloramine (NH2Cl)
   in water at pH 7 by the addition of isocyanuric acid (H3Cy) were
   determined at room temperature. Decreases in MCD absorbance at 290 nm in
   equimolar (0.04 mM) reactions of MCD and free available chlorine
   solutions containing H3Cy (0.01-1.60 mM) were recorded in a stopped-flow
   spectrophotometer. The rates indicate second-order reactions. Since the
   rate with free chlorine was high (> 7.6 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1)), the amounts
   of free chlorine in the solutions could be distinguished from that of
   chlorinated cyanurates. The chlorinating rates with chlorinated
   cyanurates decreased with an increase in H3Cy concentrations. Plotting
   the rates against the molar ratio of chlorine to H3Cy showed a linear
   correlation and the rates with chlorinated cyanurates (H2ClCy) was
   estimated at 0.5 x 10(5) M-1 s-(1). In contrast, the rates with the
   NH2Cl solution containing H3Cy increased with an increase in H3Cy
   concentrations, increasing from 1.2 x 10 to 2.7 x 10 M-1 s(-1) by the

Abstract = {{A nitrifying activated sludge reactor fed with a high salinity medium
   was operated efficiently at ammonia loading rates between 1 and 4g
   NH4(+)-N1(-1) d(-1). The system became completely inefficient at inlet
   salt concentrations higher than 525 mM due to the mixed inhibition
   effect of salts and ammonia. The final product was mainly nitrate
   although dissolved oxygen limitations caused sporadic ammonia and
   nitrite accumulations. Specific nitrifying activity decreased due to the
   saline effect. A set of activity tests showed that in the continuous
   reactor non-adapted biomass is rather more sensitive than biomass to the
   saline effect. Physical properties of biomass in the reactor (sludge
   volumetric index and zone settling velocity) were not affected by the
   saline concentration, a biomass concentration of 20 gVSS1(-1) was
   achieved. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of variable
   ground-water/surface-water exchange and photoinduced processes on
   longitudinal patterns in dissolved organic matter (DOM) and bacterial
   communities in a small first-order stream in the New Jersey Pine
   Barrens. DOM concentration, along with DOM weight average molecular
   weight (M,.) and absorptivity (8280, an estimator of aromaticity), and
   bacterial cell counts all decreased from the stream and hyporheic zone
   into the shallow aquifer in a ground-water recharge zone. Further
   downstream, influx of ground water into the stream resulted in a lower
   M, DOM pool and was accompanied by decreased cell counts. The observed
   effect of this ground-water discharge on bacterial numbers may be
   direct, if discharge temporarily dilutes cell counts, or indirect, if
   changes in DOM concentration and properties control the bacterial
   community. In either case, this study suggested the importance of
   considering ground -water-surface-water exchange in studies of
   longitudinal changes in the bacterial communities of streams. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{A study of the three-dimensional excitation-emission fluorescence matrix
   (EEFM) of organic matter from the Amazon basin rivers is reported in
   this paper. The EEFM, applied to the fractions obtained from sequential
   tangential ultrafiltration (STUF), give spectroscopic informations on
   the fluorescent properties of particulate (> 0.22mum), colloidal and
   dissolved (< 5 kD) organic matter. STUF process does not seem to alter
   the characteristic peaks position of humic material. Two characteristic
   excitation-emission peaks were observed in all fractions of the samples
   investigated, one stimulated by UV excitation (peak A) and one by
   visible excitation (peak C). Increasing the pH, fluorescence intensities
   of the fluorophores A and C, respectively, I-A and I-C, responded in the
   same manner to pH, increasing with increasing pH. However, the
   fluorophore A seems more sensitive to this pH variation because its
   fluorescence intensity enhancement is always higher. Thus the chemical
   behaviour of the two fluorophores must be somewhat differentiated. The
   evolution of the I-A/I-C ratio with pH is studied for all samples. This
   investigation showed a linear relation between I-A/I-C and pH. Moreover,
   this behaviour is water type (black or white) and molecular size
   independent. Indeed, this linear relationship is observed for all
   samples and all fractions. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this work several feed-forward back propagation neural networks
   (FFBP) were trained in order to model, and subsequently control, methane
   production in anaerobic digesters. To produce data for the training of
   the neural nets, four anaerobic continuous stirred tank reactors were
   operated in steady-state conditions at organic loading rates (Br) of
   about 2 kg m(-3) d(-1) chemical oxygen demand, and disturbed by
   pulse-like increase of the organic loading rate. For the pulses
   additional carbon sources like flour, sucrose, 1,2-diethylen glycol or
   vegetable oil were added to the basic feed, which consisted of surplus
   and primary Sludge of a local waste-water treatment plant, to increase
   the chemical oxygen demand. Measured parameters were: gas composition,
   methane production rate, volatile fatty acid concentration, pH, redox
   potential, volatile suspended solids and chemical oxygen demand of feed
   and effluent. A hierarchical system of nets was developed and embedded
   in a decision support system to find out which is the best feeding
   profile for the next time steps in advance. A 3-3-1 FFBP simulated the
   pH with a regression coefficient of 0.82. A 9-3-3 FFBP simulated the
   volatile fatty acid concentration in the sludge with a regression
   coefficient of 0.86. And a 9-3-2 FFBP simulated the gas production and
   gas composition with a regression coefficient of 0.90 and 0.80,
   respectively. A lab-scale anaerobic continuous stirred tank reactor
   controlled by this tool was able to maintain a methane concentration of
   about 60\% at a rather high gas production rate of between 5 and 5.6m(3)
   m(-3) d(-1). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Application of wastewater to soil may result in the contamination of
   groundwater and soil with pathogenic microorganisms and other biological
   and chemical agents. This study was performed to determine the antiviral
   microbial activity of soil saturated with secondary effluent. Low
   concentrations (0.05 mg/ml) of protease pronase resulted in the
   inactivation of more than 90\% of seeded Cox-A9 virus, whereas
   Poliovirus type 1, Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and MS2 bacteriophages were
   found to be insensitive to the enzyme activity. Exposure of Cox A9 virus
   to P. aeruginosa extracellular enzymes resulted in 99\% inactivation of
   the seeded virus. Hepatitis A virus was found to be as sensitive as the
   Cox A9 virus, whereas Poliovirus I and MS2 were found to be insensitive
   to P. aeruginosa extracellular enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the time
   required for 99\% reduction (T99) of Cox A9 and MS-2 Bacteriophage, at
   15degreesC, in soil saturated with secondary effluent was found to be 7
   and 21 days, respectively. Faster inactivation was observed for MS2 and
   Cox A9 in soil saturated with secondary effluent incubated at
   30degreesC, T99 of 2 and 0.3 days, respectively. Although the
   concentration of the total bacterial count in the soil samples increased
   from 10(3) cfu/g to 10(5) cfu/g after 20 days of incubation at
   30degreesC, the proteolytic activity was below the detection level. The
   results of this study indicate that the virucidal effect of microbial
   activity is virus type dependent. Furthermore microbial activity in the
   soil material can be enhanced by the application of secondary effluent
   at higher temperature. The results also showed that MS2 bacteriophage
   can be used to predict viral contamination of soil and groundwater. (C)

Abstract = {{By using the Grob closed loop stripping analysis technique a wide

   chloropicrin, halogenated ketons and chloral hydrate were the main DBPs
   determined. In chlorinated drinking water of coastal cities brominated
   DBPs were most abundant than their chlorinated homologues due to the
   higher bromide concentration in raw waters of these areas. Factor
   analysis with principal component extraction of the results demonstrated
   a clear differentiation between the examined drinking waters on the

Abstract = {{Twelve wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were sampled in France and
   Belgium in 1999 and 2000 in order to estimate the fecal coliform (FC)
   removal efficiency of various types of treatment. Only one of these
   WWTPs was equipped with a specific step to eliminate microorganisms (UV
   disinfection preceded by sand filtration). FC abundance was measured in
   raw and treated sewage by plate counts on selective medium and rapid
   beta-D-glucuronidase (GLUase)-based assays. Removal of culturable FC was
   the most efficient in treatments with high retention time (activated
   sludge process with nitrification and denitrification, lagooning), in
   biofiltration and in the treatment with a tertiary disinfection step.
   GLUase activity measurements showed the same removal pattern as plate
   counts except for UV disinfection, where no reduction of GLUase activity
   was measured. Specific loads of culturable FC and GLUase activity, i.e.
   daily amounts of culturable FC or GLUase activity in sewage per
   inhabitant-equivalent, were calculated in raw and treated wastewater for
   the different WWTPs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to investigate the behaviour of coliform
   bacteria in specific low nutritive waters conveying organic fractions
   from different origin of which an unknown part is likely to pass through
   the treatment barrier. For this purpose, we studied the growth
   (microscopic counting) and the culturability (count on nutritive medium)
   of ten coliform bacteria species as a function of the amount of organic
   matter in a river water collected after a period of heavy rain and in an
   algal bloom water. Assays were carried out in the presence of
   autochthonous heterotrophic bacteria from the Nancy (France) drinking
   water, with variable concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   representative of drinking waters (0.5-1.5 mgl(-1) for diluted river
   water samples and 1.3-2.5 mgl(-1) for diluted algal bloom water
   samples). Bacterial growth was measured in the two types of water,
   regardless of the initial concentration of DOC. We found that coliform
   bacteria lost their culturability in both sample series, and that the
   lower the initial DOC concentration the more rapidly the culturability
   was lost. The quantity of DOC consumed by the bacteria in the two water
   types (0.03-0.13 mgl(-1) in river water and 0.77-1.29 mgl(-1) in algal
   bloom water) and the resulting consequences on bacterial behaviour
   suggested that bloom water contains algal organic compounds that are
   antagonistic to the growth and/or the culturability of coliform
   bacteria. Organic matter thresholds, beyond which coliform bacteria are
   unlikely to keep their culturability, have not been determined
   experimentally. Indeed, at the end of the assays some culturable
   coliform bacteria were systematically detected in both types of water.
   Enterobacter cloacae was the predominant species. Thus, during these
   adverse events the probability of coliform occurrence can be considered
   as high in treated water. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate endotoxin concentrations in
   cyanobacterial water blooms and strains, and to assess the removal of
   endotoxins during drinking water treatment. Endotoxin concentrations
   were measured from 151 hepatotoxic, neurotoxic and non-toxic
   cyanobacterial water blooms by using Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL)
   assay, and the results were compared to bacterial data. Endotoxin
   activities ranged from 20 to 3.8 x 10(4) endotoxin units (EU) per ml.
   Endotoxicity of the samples correlated with phycobiliprotein
   concentration that was used to assess cyanobacterial abundance,
   heterotrophic plate count, and Aeromonas spp. but it did not correlate
   with the number of coliforms or streptococci. The high endotoxin
   concentrations occasionally detected in the water bloom samples were
   probably due to Gram negative bacteria that existed together with
   cyanobacteria since the 26 axenic cyanobacterial strains from different
   genera that were studied showed very low endotoxin activity. No
   differences in endotoxin activity were detected between hepatotoxic,
   neurotoxic and non-toxic strains. Removal of endotoxins during drinking
   water treatment was studied at nine waterworks that previously had been
   associated with high numbers of cyanobacteria and that used different
   processes for water purification. Endotoxin concentration in raw waters
   ranged from 18 to 356 EU ml(-1). The treatment processes reduced 59-97\%
   of the endotoxin activity; in the treated water the concentration ranged
   from 3 to 15 EU ml(-1). The most significant reduction occurred at the
   early stages of water treatment, during coagulation, settling and sand
   filtration. Activated carbon filtration either increased or had no
   effect on endotoxin concentration. Ozonation and chlorination had little
   effect on the endotoxin concentrations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Not only sulfur-oxidizing bacteria but also an acidophilic
   iron-oxidizing bacterium (or bacteria) were found in the corroded
   concrete from several sewerage systems in Japan. The surface pH of
   concrete test piece exposed to an atmosphere containing hydrogen sulfide
   of the concentrations more than 600 ppm in the systems was usually below
   2 after a month. This was attributable to ability of the
   sulfur-oxidizing bacteria to grow in the thin water layer which
   contained hydrogen sulfide and covered the piece even when the surface
   pH of concrete was 12-13. When the sulfur-oxidizing bacteria grew in the
   surface of concrete and produced sulfuric acid, the pH of the inner
   parts of concrete was lowered where the bacteria were hardly found.
   Probably, sulfuric acid formed by the bacteria in the surface parts
   penetrated into the inner parts. The different species of
   sulfur-oxidizing bacteria were found in different sewerage systems. The
   growth of the sulfur-oxidizing and acidophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria
   was completely inhibited by formates, especially by calcium formate of
   concentrations more than 50 mM. Calcium formate can protect concrete in
   sewerage systems from bacterial corrosion. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{To overcome the problem of non-specific interactions during the
   preparative fractionation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) for its
   combined chemical and biological characterization, the concept of
   standardized fractions (SFs) was developed. The concept is based on the
   calibration of the fractionation systems with suitable standards for the
   experimental definition of SFs, and the subsequent preparative
   fractionation of DOM samples according to the predefined SFs. Undesired
   non-specific interactions can thus be minimized experimentally. It was
   applied to the fractionation methods size exclusion chromatography (SEC)
   and multistage ultrafiltration (mst-UF). A brownwater sample and an
   effluent from a sewage treatment plant were fractionated. The two
   methods performed rather differently which was evidenced both by the
   polydispersity of the resulting fractions as well as sum parameter
   fractionation patterns. Consequently, the interpretation of data
   obtained from the chemical-physical as well as biological analysis must
   always consider the limitations and particularities of the fractionation
   method employed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an elevated non-ionic surfactant critical micelle
   concentration (CMC) in a soil/aqueous system was examined. Experimental
   measurements have been made of surfactant solubilization of polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) (i.e. fluoranthene and pyrene) in a 5-month
   aged PAH contaminated soil, as well as surfactant sorption onto soil.
   Fluoranthene and pyrene in the soil/aqueous system in the presence of
   three non-ionic surfactants (i.e. Tween 80, Triton X-100 and Brij 35)
   were extracted using dichloramethane and analyzed using GC-MS. Maximum
   sorption of non-ionic surfactant onto soil was evaluated using a surface
   tension technique. It was observed that PAH solubilization is
   proportional to surfactant dose after the elevated CMC, termed as the
   effective CMC (CMCeff), is achieved. The values of surfactant CMCeff
   assessed by the surface tension technique were found to be similar to
   those determined from surfactant PAH solublization, thereby proving the
   research hypothesis that surfactant sorption is the cause for the
   elevation of surfactant CMC in a soil/aqueous system. (C) 2002 Elsevier

   effective in reducing pollution; second, that local oxygenation is

Abstract = {{Biofilm and granular sludge processes are promising biotechnology for
   wastewater treatment. The formation, structure and metabolism of
   immobilized microbial community are associated very closely with
   hydrodynamic shear force in reactors. Therefore, this paper attempts to
   review the essential role of shear force in the formation and
   performance of biofilm and granular sludge. More compact, stable and
   denser biofilms, aerobic and anaerobic granules form at relatively
   higher hydrodynamic shear force. It is clearly shown that shear force
   has significant influences on the structure, mass transfer, production
   of exopolysaccharides, metabolic/genetic behaviours of biofilms, aerobic
   and anaerobic granules. In an engineering sense, hydrodynamic shear
   force can be manipulated, as a control parameter, to enhance microbial
   granulation process. It can be concluded that the knowledge regarding
   the effects of hydrodynamic slear force on biofilms and granules is far
   from complete and much research is still needed to fully understand the
   relevant mechanisms. Some of these future research niches are therefore
   outlined. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Population growth of some biogeochemical cycling bacteria
   (heterotrophic bacteria (HB), ammonifying bacteria (AB), ammonia
   oxidizing bacteria (AOB), denitrifying bacteria (DNB) and cellulose
   decomposing bacteria (CDB)), as well as ammonification and
   denitrification rates were determined in simulated pond systems treated
   with full doses (FDs) and split doses (SDs) of cadmium. Reductions in
   bacterial density and nitrogen activity rates were more severe for the
   FD and SD followed by a slight recovery in both. Among the test groups,
   reductions were maximal in the AOB and DNB and lowest for the CDB
   populations, suggesting that the latter had greater potential for
   cadmium resistance. Bicarbonate alkalinity of water was found to exert a
   profound influence in counteracting cadmium stress in the system, as
   strong negative correlations between this parameter and bacterial mass
   were evident in the SD treatment. Though the aquatic microbial
   populations were greatly altered by cadmium stress, the normal operating
   range of the system was restored at a later time with the CDB population
   showing higher degree of adaptive responses. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1677-1684}},

Abstract = {{The use of tangential flow filtration (TFF) for size fractionation of
   natural dissolved organic matter was investigated. The performance of
   regenerated cellulose membrane with a nominal molecular weight cut-off
   of 1 kDa was examined on 20 samples from take, river and estuary
   systems, characterised by contrasting dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   contents and conductivity. The evaluation was based on absorbance,
   fluorescence and DOC measurements, Detailed protocols of membrane
   cleaning and conditioning nation are proposed. The ultrafiltration
   membrane can efficiently be cleaned to provide low carbon blank (<0.01
   mg/L). Fluorescence measurements confirmed that the higher molecular
   weight compounds were isolated in the retentate and the lower molecular
   weight remain in the permeate. Mass balance for natural samples show
   good recovery for DOC (109+/-12\%, n = 20) and fluorescence measurements
   (106+/-9\%, n = 13). No relation between factors of concentration (fc)
   and mass balance quality was observed for the fc range 1.5-11. Moreover,
   high ionic strength and high DOC contents did not enhance membrane
   fouling. These findings demonstrate that reliable fractionations by TFF
   of natural organic colloids in aquatic systems can be achieved. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Trichloroethylene (TCE) adsorption by activated carbon previously loaded
   ({''}preloaded{''}) with humic substances was found to decrease with
   increasing concentrations of monovalent ions (NaCl), calcium (until
   solubility was exceeded), or dissolved oxygen in the preloading
   solution. For a given percentage of organic carbon removal during humic
   acid loading, greater reductions in TCE adsorption occurred with
   increasing monovalent ion concentration and calcium concentration at
   constant ionic strength. However, this effect was related primarily to
   the amount of humic material adsorbed-the reduction in TCE adsorption
   was independent of the ionic composition of the preloading solution when
   compared at similar humic acid loading. Experiments were performed which
   showed that calcium ions can associate with humic material after the
   humic has been adsorbed, which subsequently reduces TCE uptake, but this
   effect does not dominate when calcium is present during humic loading.
   At sufficiently high calcium concentrations (approaching solubility),
   aggregation or co-precipitation of humic acid mitigated the effects of
   preloading. In contrast to the effects of ionic composition, the
   presence of dissolved oxygen did fundamentally change the mechanism by
   which organic macromolecules compete with TCE. TCE uptake was lower when
   preloading by poly(maleic acid) (PMA) occurred in the presence of
   dissolved oxygen, even when the amount loaded was the same. One
   explanation invokes a coupling mechanism promoted by the carbon surface,
   which results in either additional blockage of TCE sorption sites,
   additional site competition, or both. In all experiments, the effects of
   preloading were consistent with those reported previously, which have
   been interpreted as a loss of high-energy sites available to TCE,
   causing a significant reduction in the site-energy heterogeneity, and
   reduced uptake in the low concentration region. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Reductive transformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) was observed in
   a continuous-flow system of Anabaena sp. operated for 33 d with a 5.7 d
   hydraulic retention time and a range of influent TNT concentrations of
   1-58 mg/l. The TNT removal efficiency of the continuous-flow system at
   the highest influent TNT concentration of 58 mg/l was 96.7+/-1.7\%
   (mean+/-95\% confidence interval). Culture chlorosis and growth
   inhibition were not observed during this study. The pseudo-first order
   TNT transformation rate constant values corresponding to the system
   performance range (0.14-0.46/h) were lower than the values previously
   recorded for batch Anabaena sp. cultures with less than 10 mg/l initial
   TNT concentrations, possibly due to an inhibition of the TNT
   transformation process by either TNT and/or TNT transformation products.
   Heterotrophic bacterial populations developed in the continuous-flow
   Anabaena sp, cultures also transformed TNT, but at a much lower rate
   than the Anabaena sp. Less than 1\%. of the overall TNT transformation
   observed in the continuous-flow system was attributed to the
   heterotrophic bacterial populations. The only TNT reduction products
   identified in both the culture media and in biomass extracts were
   azoxytetranitrotoluene isomers and low levels of aminodinitrotoluene
   isomers. TNT and TNT transformation products identified in the culture
   effluent and the biomass extract accounted for only about 24\% of the
   TNT added to the system (on a molar basis). Production of soluble, polar
   metabolites, uptake, partial mineralization and/or sequestration of TNT
   and its transformation products by Anabaena may be responsible for the
   relatively low contaminant recovery and mass balance observed in this
   study. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{At airports around the world, propylene glycol (PG) based fluids are
   used to de-ice aircraft for safe operation. PG removal was investigated
   in 15-cm deep saturated sand columns. Greater than 99\% PG
   biodegradation was achieved for all flow rates and loading conditions
   tested, which decreased the hydraulic conductivity of the sand by 1-3
   orders of magnitude until a steady-state minimum was reached. Under
   constant loading at 120mg PG/d for 15-30d, the hydraulic conductivity
   (K) decreased by 2-2.5 orders of magnitude when the average linear
   velocity of the water was 4.9-1.4 cm/h. Variable PG loading in
   recirculation tests resulted in slower conductivity declines and lower
   final steady-state conductivity than constant PG feeding. After
   significant sand plugging, endogenous periods of time without PG
   resulted in significant but partial recovery of the original
   conductivity. Biomass growth also increased the dispersivity of the

Abstract = {{We have analyzed the dissolved activity of various radionuclides of
   natural origin (Ra-226 and U-234,U-235,U-238) and artificial origins
   (Sr-90 and Pu239+240), together with other non-radioactive
   physico-chemical parameters (pH, conductivity, dry residue, {[}Ca2+],
   {[}Mg2+], {[}K+] and {[}Fe-2+,Fe-3+], in both pre-potable and potable
   water from 17 treatment plants in Extremadura (Spain). We have
   established a series of criteria and complementary techniques to the
   traditional methods of purification, aimed at the quantitative
   elimination of the presence in solution of the mentioned radionuclides.
   We highlight: (a) the increment of the mineral content of the water in
   its treatment succeeds in eliminating Ra-226, until reaching values
   close to 70\%; (b) the increment of the mineralization of the water by
   addition of chemical reagents, conducted within the pH values 7.1 and
   7.8, succeeds in eliminating up to 90\% of the total uranium in
   dissolution; (c) the elimination of Sr-90 during the purification is
   poor, in general, reaching average levels of only 15\% when the
   purification process is practiced within concrete ranges for potable
   water (pH > 7, conductivity > 150 muS/cm, dry residue > 150 mg/l,
   {[}Ca2(+)] > 10 mg/l and {[}Mg2+] > 1.2mg/l), and finally, (d) the
   decrease of the solubility of the iron, as low as it can get during the
   purification process, together with an increase of the conductivity
   associated, in principle, to parallel increments of other variables not
   analyzed in this work, such as SO42-, CO32-, etc. the activity of
   dissolved Pu-239divided by240 decreases to 90\%. The application of the
   traditional processes of water purification outside the ranges and
   criteria formulated can increase the presence in dissolution up to
   400\%, for some radionuclides, largely the consequence of its
   redissolution from the non-soluble fraction of the water. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Faecal-indicator budget studies have shown marine bathing water quality
   at two small UK coastal resorts, Staithes and Newport, to be adversely
   affected by riverine inputs from lowland pastoral catchments (J.
   Chartered Inst. Water Environ. Mangt. 12 (1998) 414). The present paper
   reports on presumptive coliform (PC), presumptive Escherichia coli (PE)
   and presumptive streptococci (PS) concentrations at 43 sampling points
   on watercourses within these catchments, and on their relationship with
   land use and livestock-related management practices, such as grazing and
   slurry/manure applications. The results show > 10-fold elevations in
   geometric mean faecal-indicator concentrations under high-flow
   conditions, compared with low flow, with maximum high-flow geometric
   mean PC, PE and PS concentrations of 2.6 x 10(6), 1.8 x 10(6) and 4.4 x
   10(5) cfu/100 ml, respectively. High-flow geometric mean concentrations
   exhibit highly significant positive correlations with land
   use/management variables associated with intensive livestock farming,
   both within the individual catchments and in the two combined.
   Additional factors, such as antecedent weather conditions and
   topography, contribute to inter-catchment variability in water quality.
   Although inputs from diffuse and point sources of pollution were not
   quantified, point sources (e.g. runoff from farm yards) seem likely to
   be significant. The findings suggest that it may be possible to develop
   generic statistical models to predict microbial water quality from land
   use and farm management data. They also provide indirect evidence that
   channel bed sediment `stores' closely reflect land use within their
   catchments and that there is little die-off of organisms along
   watercourses. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The duckweeds Lemna minor L. and L. minuscula Herter reduced PSII
   quantum efficiency (F'(q)/F'(m)) of the filamentous green alga
   Cladophora glomerata Kutzing by up to 42\% over seven days when floating
   above mats of C. glomerata in containers. Dissolved oxygen (DO)
   increased by 23\% at 30degreesC in containers with C. glomerata over
   controls. But when the water surface in the containers was covered with
   Lemna spp. floating above C. glomerata, DO was 83\% lower at 30degreesC
   over seven days than in control samples with no duckweed or alga.
   Dissolved oxygen was lower beneath a thick mat (1 cm) of either Lemna
   spp. covering the surface than under a thin layer (single-frond canopy).
   PAM fluorimetry showed that maximum PSII efficiency (F-v/F-m) of C.
   glomerata in containers was reduced under a canopy of L. minor by 17\%
   over seven days, and under L. minuscula by 22\%. F'(q)/F'(m) of C.
   glomerata in containers exposed to 51 mumol m(-2)s(-1) PPFD decreased
   under a canopy of L. minor by 16\% over seven days, and under L.
   minuscula by 19\% compared to controls. When light response curves were
   compared, F'(q)/F'(m) was significantly reduced under canopies of L.
   minor at the highest temperatures tested (28degreesC and 30degreesC). L.
   minor significantly reduced relative electron transport rate (rel. ETR)
   of the controls by up to 71\% at 30degreesC. Relative electron transport
   rate did not reach light saturation point (E-sat) except at 28degrees
   and 30degreesC under mats of L. minor. Whereas the highest rate of
   production (rel. ETRmax) and E-sat increased with temperature in
   controls, under a canopy of Lemna, decreases were observed. It is
   suggested that, during periods of high summer temperature and
   irradiance, shading inhibits oxygenic photosynthesis in mats of C.
   glomerata beneath canopies of Lemna spp. This results in less oxygen
   being produced by the C. glomerata (oxygen produced by Lemna spp. is not
   released into the water), and this may further inhibit the C. glomerata
   by limiting oxygen-dependent electron transport and/or photo
   respiration. This feedback loop could lead to the eventual senescence of
   the C. glomerata. The combination of low oxygen, high temperature and
   stressed filamentous algae, particularly in slow or standing water, may
   help to explain sudden collapses in DO concentration, with detrimental
   effects on water quality downstream. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Urban nonpoint source pollution is a significant contributor to water
   quality degradation. Watershed planners need to be able to estimate
   nonpoint source loads to takes and streams if they are to plan effective
   management strategies. To meet this need for the twin cities
   metropolitan area, a large database of urban and suburban runoff data
   was compiled. Stormwater runoff loads and concentrations of 10 common
   constituents (six N and P forms, TSS, VSS, COD, Pb) were characterized,
   and effects of season and land use were analyzed. Relationships between
   runoff variables and storm and watershed characteristics were examined.
   The best regression equation to predict runoff volume for rain events
   was based on rainfall amount, drainage area, and percent impervious area
   (R-2 = 0.78). Median event-mean concentrations (EMCs) tended to be
   higher in snowmelt runoff than in rainfall runoff, and significant
   seasonal differences were found in yields (kg/ha) and EMCs for most
   constituents, Simple correlations between explanatory variables and
   stormwater loads and EMCs were weak. Rainfall amount and intensity and
   drainage area were the most important variables in multiple linear
   regression models to predict event loads, but uncertainty was high in
   models developed with the pooled data set. The most accurate models for

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new method for removal of nitrate from groundwater, in
   which elemental sulfur-based denitrification (autotrophic
   denitrification) and membrane separation are combined, is proposed. By
   using a membrane, autotrophic denitrifiers, whose growth rate is
   considerably low, can be kept at a high concentration. The performance
   of the proposed process was examined through a long-term experiment in
   the laboratory using synthetic feed water. A rotating membrane disk
   module equipped with UF membrane (750.000Da) was used in this study.
   Complete removal of nitrate (25mg N/L) was achieved under the conditions
   of a biomass concentration of about 1000 mg protein/L and HRT of 160min.
   Dissolved oxygen concentration and sulfur/biomass ratio in the membrane
   chamber were found to be the key factors in maintenance of high-process
   performance, Deterioration in membrane permeability was insignificant.
   It was found that membrane filtration could be continued with a water
   flux of 0.5 m(3)/m(2)/day for about 100 days without any chemical
   membrane cleaning. The proposed process, however, caused a slight
   increase in assimilable organic carbon. Sulfide was not detected in the
   denitrified water. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity and distribution of microbes within brewery-degrading
   anaerobic sludge granules were studied using various molecular
   techniques. Molecular cloning of small-subunit rRNA gene sequences
   indicated that all archaeal clones were affiliated with Methanosaeta
   concilli (>99\% sequence similarity), and the bacterial clones were
   mostly affiliated with a not-yet-cultured Clostridium cluster (48 out of
   99 clones) in the low G + C gram-positive group, Xanthomonas spp. in the
   gamma-subclass of Proteohacteria (30 clones), and Desulfovibrio spp. (16
   clones) in the delta-subclass of Proteobacteria. Slot-blot hybridization
   indicated that archaeal cells from the Methanomierobiales (58.4\% of
   total rRNA), Methanobacterials (3.3\%) and Methanococcales (1.0\%)
   accounted for 62.4\% of the total community rRNA. The rest of the
   microbial populations were the clostridial cluster (27.3\% of total
   rRNA) and Desulfovibrio spp. (9.4\%). Fluorescence in-situ hybridization
   with domain and group-specific oligonucleotide probes further revealed a
   multi-layer,granular architecture. On the surface layer, the hydrolytic
   clostridial species and hydrogenotrophic Methanobacteriales were the
   predominant. In the middle layer, mostly H-producing acetogens from the
   delta-Proteobacteria (i.e., Dsulfovibrio spp.), hydrogenotrophic
   Methanobacteriales and aceticlastic Methanosaeta were observed to
   presumably form a syntrophic association. Finally, the center core
   consisted of microcolonies of Methanosaeta cells. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The capacity of ion exchange resins, IRN77 and SKN1, for removal of
   cobalt from aqueous solution has been investigated under different
   conditions namely initial solution pH, initial metal-ion concentration,
   and contact time. The equilibrium data obtained in this study have been
   found to fit both the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms. The
   adsorption of Co(II) on these resins follows first-order reversible
   kinetics. The film diffusion of Co(II) in these ion exchange resins was

Abstract = {{A PAH- and phenol-degrading microorganism, Pseudomonas putida (ATCC
   17484), was used to study the substrate interactions during cell growth
   on carbazole-containing mixtures with p-cresol and sodium salicylate.
   Both p-cresol and sodium salicylate could be utilised by the bacteria as
   the sole carbon and energy sources. When cells grew on the mixture of
   carbazole, p-cresol and sodium salicylate, strong substrate interactions
   were observed. Carbazole degradation started only after p-cresol was
   significantly or completely removed, and the removal of carbazole was
   incomplete when the initial p-cresol concentration was higher than 20
   mg/l. No carbazole was removed at all when the initial p-cresol
   concentration in the system was higher than 120 mg/l. When cells grew on
   the ternary substrates, the specific growth rate was found to increase
   with p-cresol concentration up to 50 mg/l (from 0.33 to 0.45 h(-1)) but
   decreased monotonically with higher concentrations. At 120 mg/l
   p-cresol, specific growth rate fell to 0.33 h(-1). The inhibitory effect
   of p-cresol was demonstrated where carbazole degradation was immediately
   halted when 50 mg/l p-cresol was spiked to a system containing carbazole
   and sodium salicylate, Besides, the addition of p-cresol was also found
   to inhibit the degradation of sodium salicylate. With p-cresol, ail
   increase in lag time was observed and the utilisation of sodium
   salicylate as carbon source was severely retarded. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Comparison of filtration characteristics of organic and inorganic
   membranes was made in terms of physicochemical properties of the
   membrane materials, cake layer formation, backflushing and backfeeding
   effects in a membrane-coupled anaerobic bioreactor. For the inorganic
   membrane, struvite (MgNH(4)PO(4)(.)6H(2)O) was found to have accumulated
   inside the membrane pore and plays a key role in flux decline. For the
   organic, however, a thick cake layer composed of biomass and struvite
   formed on the membrane surface, thus causing a major hydraulic
   resistance. In order to mitigate flux decline for both membranes,
   backflushing and backfeeding modes were examined. With acidic (pH 2.0)
   backflushing, the flux was approximately doubled for the organic
   membrane. However, unexpectedly a negative effect was observed for the
   inorganic membrane. An alkaline backflushing instead of acidic
   backflushing gave rise to a flux improvement by a factor of two without
   any negative effect, even for the inorganic membrane. The backfeeding
   mode gave rise to a much higher flux compared with the normal mode in
   both types of membrane, although the flux returned to the same level as
   that with the normal mode after 6 days for the inorganic membrane. The
   differences between the two types of membranes were explained by
   membrane morphology, a ligand exchange reaction as well as a surface
   charge effect. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Carboxylated alginic acid prepared through oxidation reaction with
   potassium permanganate had a high uptake capacity of 3.1 mmol/g dry mass
   at pH 4 and showed higher affinity to heavy metals compared to alkaline
   metals (Ca2+, Mg2+) in mixed metal system. The pH,PC value of the
   carboxylated alginic acid was 2.31, which was lower than pH,, (2.83) of
   natural alginic acid. The increased number of carboxyl groups was
   confirmed by IR and C-13-NMR spectrum analysis, elemental analysis and
   carboxyl group number count. Lead adsorption by carboxylated alginic
   acid is an endothermic process since binding was increased as the
   temperature increased. When the temperature of wastewater is higher than
   room temperature, carboxylated alginic acid has an advantage over
   general adsorbents whose uptake capacity decreases as the temperature
   increases. Also, lead adsorbed on carboxylated alginic acid was desorbed
   effectively by about 80\% by nitrilotriaceticacid. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Several methods were tested to optimise sulphate reduction and minimise
   methane formation in thermophilic (65degrees) expanded granular sludge
   bed reactors fed with a medium containing sulphate and methanol.
   Lowering the pH from 7.5 to 6.75 resulted in a rapid decrease of methane
   formation and a concomitant increase in sulphate reduction. The
   inhibition of methane formation was irreversible on the short-term.
   Lowering the COD/SO42- ratio (COD: chemical oxygen demand) from 6 to
   0.34 (g/g) rapidly favoured sulphate reduction over methanogenesis.
   Continuous addition of 2 g L-1 2-bromoethanesulphonate was ineffective
   as complete inhibition of methanogenesis was obtained only for two days.
   Inhibition of methanogens by sulphide at pH 7.5 was only effective when
   the total sulphide concentration was above 1200 mg S L-1. For practical
   applications, a relatively short exposure to a slightly acidic pH in
   combination with operating the reactor at a volumetric methanol-COD

Abstract = {{Formation of struvite (MgNH(4)PO(4)(.)6H(2)O) at sewage treatment works
   can cause operational problems and decrease efficiency. Struvite has a
   commercial value and the controlled formation and recovery of it would
   be beneficial.
   A mass balance was conducted at full scale across the whole sewage
   treatment plant in order to identify a stream to conduct bench-scale
   struvite crystallisation studies. The most suitable stream was
   identified as the centrifuge liquors. The average flow of the liquor
   stream was 393 m(3) d(-1) and the composition was as follows: 167 mg L-1
   phosphorus, 44 mg L-1 magnesium, 615 mg L-1 ammonium, 56 mg L-1 calcium
   and 2580 mg L-1 of alkalinity. The pH averaged at 7.6 and the stream had
   a predicted struvite precipitation potential of 140 mg L-1.
   Struvite crystallisation occurred quickly during the trials, by raising
   the pH of the centrifuge liquors to 9.0 and dosing with magnesium. Up to
   97\% phosphorus removal as struvite was achieved. Struvite formation
   occurred when the molar ratio of magnesium: phosphorus was at least
   1.05:1. Below this ratio phosphorus removals of 72\% were observed, but
   not exclusively as struvite. Annual yields of struvite were calculated
   to be 42-100 tonnes a year, depending on the dose regime. Revenue from
   the sale of produced struvite could be between pound8400 and pound20,000
   a year. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The development and evaluation of a 2-dimensional physical model, which
   is designed to assist in the characterisation of complex solute
   transport problems in porous media, is described. The laboratory model
   is a transparent 2-dimensional porous media of nominal thickness and
   uses a non-invasive imaging technique in conjunction with a fluorescent
   dye tracer (sodium fluorescein) to monitor solute movements. Under
   ultraviolet (UV) illumination the dye emits visible light which is
   imaged by a CCD (Charge Coupled Device) camera. The image is processed
   to estimate the 2-dimensional distribution of tracer concentrations. The
   system can successfully model a simple contaminant plume within a
   homogenous porous matrix constructed from glass beads (60-100 mum).
   Experimental results show that transverse dispersion coefficient was 3.9
   x 10(-10) m(2)/s when sodium fluorescein transported in porous matrix
   with a water velocity of 5.71 x 10(-6) m/s. The low transverse
   dispersion coefficient suggests that the molecular diffusion of solute
   cannot be neglected under low velocity of the water. The advantages of
   using UV rather than an ordinary light system are a reduction in noise
   and experimental errors. Errors due to light dispersion within the model
   are shown to be negligible for the current model. Since contaminant with
   aromatic rings are usually fluorescent and biological samples can be
   labelled by fluorescent dye, this imaging technique using UV excited
   fluorescent dye will be used to investigate biodegradation process in
   porous media. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, considerable investment has been committed to sewerage
   infrastructure and new sewage treatment plants in the catchment
   surrounding an estuarine basin along the north-west coast of England.
   Although this capital investment has resulted in a marked reduction in
   the input of bacterial loads, relatively high counts of faecal indicator
   organisms are still being encountered in the coastal receiving waters,
   and the local bathing waters continue to fail on occasions to comply
   with the European Community (EC) Bathing Water Directive (1976)
   mandatory standards. Details are given herein of a comprehensive
   modelling study aimed at quantifying the impact of various bacterial
   inputs into the estuary and surrounding coastal waters on the bathing
   water quality. The model domain includes the coastal area and the entire
   estuary (namely the Ribble) up to the tidal limits of its tributaries.
   Faecal coliforms have been used as the main water quality indicator
   organisms. The numerical model developed for this study combines a depth
   integrated two-dimensional coastal model and a cross-sectionally
   integrated one-dimensional river model, and is capable of predicting
   water surface elevations, velocity fields and faecal coliform
   concentration distributions across the entire model domain. The
   hydrodynamic model was calibrated using water level and velocity
   measurements from three surveys and then validated against measured data
   from three other surveys. In order to predict the faecal coliform
   concentration distributions, variable faecal coliform decay rates were
   used, i.e. different values of decay rates were applied to the coastal
   and riverine waters, for day- and nighttime, and for wet and dry weather
   conditions. The maximum and minimum decay rates used were 2.32/day and
   0.71/day, for the dry and wet weather surveys, respectively. The model
   was then applied to (i) assess the impact of previous discharge
   strategies and investigate the effectiveness of future capital
   investment works and (ii) predict the impact of a range of strategic
   options, including: the effects of adding UV treatment, constructing
   storm water storage tanks and incorporating various combined sewer
   overflow (CSO) discharge scenarios for different weather conditions. (C)

Abstract = {{(I) ncreasing system closure in paper mills and higher process water
   temperatures make the applicability of thermophilic treatment systems
   increasingly important. The use of activated sludge as a suitable
   thermophilic post-treatment system for anaerobically pre-treated paper
   process water from a paper mill using recycled wastepaper was studied.
   Two lab-scale plug flow activated sludge reactors were run in parallel
   for 6 months; a thermophilic reactor at 55degreesC and a reference
   reactor at 30degreesC. Both reactors were operated simultaneously at 20,
   15 and 10 days SRT. The effects of temperature and SRT on sludge
   settleability and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies of
   different fractions were studied. Total COD removal percentages over the
   whole experimental period were 58 +/- 5\% at 30degreesC and 48 +/- 10\%
   at 55degreesC. The effect of the SRT on the total COD removal was
   negligible. Differences in total COD removal between both systems were
   due to a lesser removal of soluble and colloidal COD at 55degreesC
   compared to the reference system. At 30degreesC, colloidal COD removal
   percentages were 65 +/- 25\%, 75 +/- 17\% and 86 +/- 22\% at 20, 15 and
   10 days SRT, respectively. At 55degreesC, these percentages were 48 +/-
   34\%, 40 +/- 28\% and 70 +/- 25\%, respectively. The effluent
   concentrations of colloidal COD in both systems were related to the
   influent concentration of colloidal material. The thermophilic sludge
   was not able to retain influent colloidal material as well as the
   mesophilic sludge causing a higher thermophilic effluent turbidity.
   Sludge settling properties were excellent in both reactor systems. These
   were neither temperature nor SRT dependent but were rather caused by
   extensive calcium precipitation in the aeration tanks creating a very

Abstract = {{A 17-month survey based on weekly testing for Cryptosporidium oocysts in
   surface waters draining a livestock farm on a Warwickshire (UK) estate
   has shown that the parasite is present throughout the year, with the
   highest frequency of occurrence and maximum concentrations during the
   autumn and winter. The 190 ha farm is managed as an exemplar for a
   teaching institution. There were up to 800 livestock present at peak
   times of year in the catchment of the stream draining the estate.
   Oocysts were concentrated from grab samples by a flocculation procedure,
   stained with monoclonal antibody and detected by fluorescence
   microscopy. Overall, 274/418 (66\%) of samples were positive for
   Cryptosporidium. Where the stream passed from the estate, the occurrence
   was 79\%, with mean and median oocysts/l of 0.48 and 0.2, respectively.
   Highest oocyst levels coincided with calving and increased wild animal
   numbers following breeding. There was no correlation of oocyst levels
   with rainfall or slurry spreading. Cryptosporidium was also frequently
   found in a pond on arable land (no livestock) indicating that wild
   animals alone contributed oocysts to surface waters. These results from
   a well managed livestock farm may represent a typical natural baseline
   for levels of occurrence and concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts in
   surface waters of the lowland agricultural environment of the UK. (C)

Abstract = {{A model of the concentrations of suspended solids (SS) in the aeration
   tanks and in the effluent from these during Aeration tank settling (ATS)
   operation is established. The model is based on simple SS mass balances,
   a model of the sludge settling and a simple model of how the SS
   concentration in the effluent from the aeration tanks depends on the
   actual concentrations in the tanks and the sludge blanket depth.
   The model is formulated in continuous time by means of stochastic
   differential equations with discrete-time observations. The parameters
   of the model are estimated using a maximum likelihood method from data
   from an alternating BioDenipho waste water treatment plant (WWTP).
   The model is an important tool for analyzing ATS operation and for
   selecting the appropriate control actions during ATS, as the model can
   be used to predict the SS amounts in the aeration tanks as well as in
   the effluent from the aeration tanks. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{An immobilised fungal bioreactor operated with pulsation of the

   a model compound and Phanerochaete chrysosporium as the ligninolytic
   fungus. High percentages of decolourisation-between 65\% and 80\%-under
   optimal conditions were achieved. Moreover, the system proved to have
   high stability with long operational periods (at least, 90 days). During
   the operation Manganese Peroxidase was the sole ligninolytic enzyme
   detected which points out this enzyme as the main substance responsible
   for decolourisation. The optimal conditions established were the
   following: temperature of 37degreesC, use of oxygen, Mn2+ concentrations
   between 33 and 330 muM and exogenous 11,0, added in periodical pulses
   (as chemical reagent, 1 muM or as H2O enzymatically generated by 0.6 U

Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1902-1908}},

Abstract = {{Infrared sensor, based on attenuated total reflection phenomenon, for
   the detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs) represents a big
   advantage compared to chromatographic and mass spectroscopic techniques
   since it is a one step detector. Pre-concentration and separation take
   place in the polymer film with simultaneous identification of pollutants
   by the infrared beam. The analysis is rapid, sample does not require any
   initial preparation, and can be easily performed in the field. The main
   default of the latest version of the sensor was a low sensibility (above
   1 ppm) compared to the threshold levels of the contaminants. In the
   present work, it is documented that the response dynamics of the optical
   sensor and its sensitivity depend strongly on the diffusion of
   pollutants through a boundary layer formed between polymer film and the
   monitored solution and in the polymer film. The reduction of thickness
   of the boundary layer through a controlled high flow rate, and the
   optimization or thickness (volume) of polymer films result in a
   tremendous improvement of the response dynamics. It is demonstrated that
   the sensor can detect simultaneously six CHCs: monochlorobenzene,
   1,2-dichlorobenzene, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, chloroform,

Abstract = {{An efficient method for the determination of nanogram levels of zinc in
   waters (potable, irrigation, waste and sea waters) is described.
   Acidified water samples were analyzed by an accurately optimized
   time/temperature program for electrothermal atomic absorption
   spectrometry. The samples were previously treated with a matrix modifier
   consisting of 0.1\% Mg(NO3)(2) in 0.5M HNO3 and injected through a
   graphite tube with L'Vov platform. Sample recoveries, repeteability, and
   analyses of NIST reference material demonstrated the reliability and
   accuracy of this technique. Zinc concentrations ranged from 2.0 to 73.0
   mug l(-1). No significant differences among the mean zinc levels
   determined in the four types of water considered from southeastern Spain
   were found. Zinc concentrations in waters from the Lone were not
   affected by human and industrial activity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The long-term effects of Cr(VI) on life history traits of Daphnia magna
   Straus were studied in relation to different feeding conditions or to
   the presence of Scenedesmus acutus exudates, which had proved to reduce
   chromium toxicity to the alga. In high feeding conditions the
   concentration of 14 mug Cr(VI)/L had negative effects on survival,
   growth and fecundity. In low feeding conditions the effects on growth
   were not evident, but daphnids changed the reproductive strategy
   normally adopted in case of food shortage and showed a daily rate of
   newborn production higher than control; however, newborn were of a
   smaller size and less resistant to starvation. The most relevant effect
   of Cr was a shortening of the daphnid life span, which was independent
   of the feeding conditions and occurred also when growth and daily rate
   of neonate production were not affected. The algal exudates resulted
   ineffective in reducing Cr toxicity to daphnids, but caused a strong
   decrease in daphnid fecundity. Further experiments on S. acutus
   demonstrated that the detoxifying effect observed in the algae might
   involve a specific Cr/algae/exudates interaction, which occurs only when
   the algae are previously subjected to a short-time stress by chromium.

Abstract = {{Waste tyre rubber can be used as a precursor for the production of high
   quality activated carbons. However, there is concern that inorganic
   impurities present in the rubber feed may restrict their use in liquid
   phase applications with high purity requirements. This paper presents an
   investigation of the presence and the leaching of inorganic species from
   activated carbons derived from waste tyre rubber. For the purpose of
   this work, a number of carbons were produced, characterised for their
   BET surface area and analysed for their inorganic composition.
   Subsequently, a number of tests were performed to evaluate the leaching
   of different inorganic species into solution at various pH values and
   carbon doses. Results showed that rubber-derived carbons contained
   elevated concentrations of sulphur and zinc, as well as traces of other
   metals such as lead, cadmium, chromium and molybdenum. Inorganic levels
   were significantly affected by production conditions, particularly
   degree of carbon activation and the nature of the gasification agent.
   However, leaching tests showed that the availability of these species in
   neutral pH conditions was very limited. Results demonstrated that, when
   using carbons doses comparable to those employed in water treatment
   works, only sulphur levels exceeded, in some occasions, health based
   quality standards proposed for drinking water. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The effects of tertiary wastewater treatment on the prevalence of
   antimicrobial resistant bacteria were investigated in two large-scale
   municipal treatment plants during a period of six months. Total and
   relative numbers of resistant bacteria were determined in raw sewage,
   treated sewage and anaerobically digested sludge by bacteriological
   counts on media selective for coliforms (MacConkey agar) and
   Acinetobacter spp. (Baumann agar). In addition, the level of
   antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the disc-diffusion method
   in 442 Acinetobacter isolates identified by colony hybridisation with a
   genus-specific DNA probe. Independent of the different antibiotics and
   media used, the total numbers of resistant bacteria in treated sewage
   were 10-1000 times lower than in raw sewage. Based on linear regression
   analysis of data on bacteriological counts, the prevalences of
   antimicrobial-resistant presumptive coliforms and Acinetobacter spp. in
   treated sewage and digested sludge were not significantly higher
   compared with raw sewage. On the contrary at one plant, statistically
   significant decreases were observed in the prevalence of
   ampicillin-resistant presumptive Acinetobacter spp. (p = 0.0188)
   following sewage treatment, and in the prevalence of either
   ampicillin-resistant presumptive Acinetobacter spp. (p = 0.0013) or
   ampicillin- and gentamicin-resistant presumptive coliforms (p = 0.0273
   and p = 0.0186) following sludge treatment. The results obtained by
   bacteriological counts were confirmed by antimicrobial susceptibility
   testing of Acinetobacter isolates. Based on logistic regression
   analysis, isolates from treated sewage and digested sludge were
   generally not significantly more resistant compared with isolates from
   raw sewage. Based on these evidences, it was concluded that tertiary
   wastewater treatment did not result in a selection of antimicrobial
   resistant bacteria. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Transmissible pathogens in source-separated human urine, intended for
   reuse in agriculture, mainly originate from faeces that
   cross-contaminate the urine. The health risks associated with the
   enteric pathogens will largely be dependent on their initial
   concentration and their inactivation during storage in the urine. Faecal
   sterols have proven stable in urine and can, rather than indicator
   bacteria, be used to quantify the faecal cross-contamination. In this
   study, urine collection tanks were sampled and ratios between various
   faecal sterols were used to determine if the urine was contaminated by
   faeces. Twenty-two percent of samples from the upper part of the tanks
   and 37\% of samples from the bottom sludge were found to be
   contaminated. Coprostanol concentrations in the contaminated urine
   samples corresponded to a mean faecal contamination of 9.1 +/- 5.6 mg
   l(-1) urine. E. coli was absent in a majority of the samples. Faecal
   streptococci and clostridia were enumerated but not found to correlate
   with coprostanol concentrations in contaminated samples. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Flow-through aquifer columns packed with a middle layer of granular iron
   (Fe-0) were used to study the applicability and limitations of
   bio-enhanced Fe-0 barriers for the treatment of contaminant mixtures in
   groundwater. Concentration profiles along the columns showed extensive
   degradation of hexavalent chromium Cr(VI), nitrate, sulfate, and
   trichloroethene (TCE), mainly in the Fe-0 layer. One column was
   bioaugmented with Shewanella algae BRY, an iron-reducing bacterium that
   could enhance Fe-0 reactivity by reductive dissolution of passivating
   iron oxides. This strain did not enhance Cr(VI), which was rapidly
   reduced by iron, leaving little room for improvement by microbial
   participation. Nevertheless, BRY-enhanced nitrate removal (from 15\% to
   80\%), partly because this strain has a wide range of electron
   acceptors, including nitrate. Sulfate was removed (55\%) only in a
   column that was bioaugmented with a mixed culture containing
   sulfate-reducing bacteria. Apparently, these bacteria used H, (produced
   by Fe-0 corrosion) as electron donor to respire sulfate. Most of the TCE
   was degraded in the zone containing Fe-0 (50-70\%), and bioaugmentation
   with BRY slightly increased the removal efficiency to about 80\%.
   Microbial colonization of the Fe-0 surface was confirmed by scanning
   electron microscopy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a modeling approach that quantifies the unified theory
   presented in the companion paper. In this approach, we use mathematical
   modeling to quantify the relationships among three solid
   species-bacteria, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and inert
   residual biomass-two soluble microbial products (SMP), original
   substrate, and an electron acceptor. According to the model, donor
   electrons are used for the synthesis of biomass, EPS, and
   utilization-associated products. Residual inert biomass and
   biomass-associated products are produced from the decay of active
   biomass and the hydrolysis of EPS, respectively. The model includes mass
   balance equations that consistently describe the flow of electrons among
   the components. It is solved with a set of parameters appropriate to the
   experimental study of Hsieh et al. (Biotech. Bioeng. 44 (1994) 219).
   Model outputs capture all trends observed in steady-state CSTR
   experiments and transient batch experiments. This agreement supports
   that the unified theory correctly captures the interconnections among
   SMP, EPS, and active and inert biomass. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Conventional biological wastewater treatment plants do not easily
   degrade the dyes and polyvinyl alcohols (PVOH) in textile effluents.
   Results are reported on the possible advantages of anaerobic/aerobic
   cometabolism in sequenced redox reactors. A six phase anaerobic/aerobic
   sequencing laboratory scale batch reactor was developed to treat a
   synthetic textile effluent. The wastewater included PVOH from desizing
   and an azo dye (Remazol Black). The reactor removed 66\% of the applied
   total organic carbon (load F: M 0.15) compared to 76\% from a control
   reactor without dye. Colour removal was 94\% but dye metabolites caused
   reactor instability. Aromatic amines from the anaerobic breakdown of the
   azo dyes were not completely mineralised by the aerobic phase. Breakdown
   of PVOH by the reactor (20-30\%) was not as good as previous reports
   with entirely aerobic cultures. The anaerobic cultures were able to
   tolerate the oxygen and methane continued to be produced but there was a
   deterioration in settlement. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A flow-through chamber was developed for toxicity testing of mobile
   species that require microscopic observation to assess viability and
   development; no sub-sampling was required in this method. Organisms were
   held in 1.5 mL volumes in 30 turn plastic petri plates adapted with two
   side sections containing 35 mum screening to provide drainage. Test
   solutions continuously entered via a drip tube; five 1.5 mL volumes were
   exchanged per hour. The 30 mm organism dish was housed in an outer dish
   (60 mm petri plate) that captured effluent for water quality
   measurements. Direct observation of organisms in the thin water layer
   occurred without refocusing the microscope. The flow-through chamber was
   used to test the toxicity of copper to Mercenaria mercenaria (hard clam)
   as they developed from free swimming larvae (similar to80 + mum) through
   metamorphosis to the settlement stage (similar to200 mum). The
   flow-through chamber performed well and good water quality was
   maintained throughout the assay. Metamorphosis occurred at the
   appropriate developmental time with relatively low variability between
   replicates. Copper. Lit a concentration of 14 P g, 1 Cu, was shown to
   significantly increase mortality and inhibit metamorphosis after 36 h of
   exposure. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The sorption of benzo{[}a]pyrene (BaP) to sediment contaminated by acid
   mine drainage from the River Carrion. SW England, has been studied as a
   function of particle concentration in river water and seawater. The
   sediment is iron-rich and has a high specific surface area, and previous
   studies have demonstrated that it exhibits positive surface charge when
   suspended in native river water (pH similar to 5), and, through an
   increase in pH (to about 8) and the adsorption of organic matter,
   negative charge when suspended in seawater. Unit sorption of BaP
   exhibited an inverse dependency on particle concentration (particle
   concentration effect, PCE) in seawater, but was relatively invariant in
   river water. Consequently, BaP was apparently salted out at particle
   concentrations below about 100 mg l(-1), and salted in at higher
   particle concentrations. The absence of a PCE (and inherent salting in)
   for Such a hydrophobic compound is an unusual, and possibly unique
   observation, and is inconsistent with a third (e.g. colloidal) phase
   model. More likely, a PCE in seawater is caused, in part, by salt
   induced particle-particle or particle-organic matter interactions which
   result in increasing particle aggregation or sorption irreversibility
   with increasing particle concentration. Although the results have
   limited environmental application and do not conclusively resolve any
   causal mechanisms for the PCE, they suggest that, with respect to
   neutral organic compounds, adsorbed organic matter is a pre-requisite
   for a PCE in the natural environment, and the effect should not solely
   or generally be attributed to the existence of a third phase. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Irgarol 1051 is a recent herbicidal compound, inhibitor of
   photosynthesis. Used in antifouling paints. This toxic is persistent in
   aquatic environments, with low abiotic and biotic degradation, highly
   phytotoxic and has already been detected in estuaries and coastal areas,
   with Suspected negative impacts on non-target organisms (aquatic plants
   and algae). We measured the toxicity of Irgarol 1051 to macrophytes and
   phytoplankton from Lake Geneva (between Switzerland and France) by
   determining chlorophyll fluorescence yield. and phytoplankton primary
   production. Long-term toxicity for phytoplankton was estimated in a
   microcosm study. and growth inhibition tests were performed with
   isolated algal strains. The concentration of Irgarol 1051 was analysed
   in the water. and the most polluted site showed a higher level (up to
   135 ng/L) than the lowest observed effect concentration for
   phytoplankton (8-80 ng/L), while the macrophytes appeared to be more
   tolerant to Irgarol 1051 in short-term tests. The microcosm Study showed
   that phytoplankton structure might be even more sensitive to Irgarol
   1051. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   delineated. An efficient as well as simple open boundary condition is
   employed for pollutant transport in this mathematical model. It is then
   applied to model the distribution and transport of Chemical Oxygen

Abstract = {{We conducted a series of pseudo-steady-state experiments on a novel
   hollow-fiber membrane biofilm reactor used for denitrification of
   oligotrophic waters, such as drinking water. We applied a range of
   nitrate loading's and hydrogen pressures to establish under what
   conditions the system could attain three goodness-of-performance
   criteria: partial nitrate removal. minimization of hydrogen wasting, and
   low nitrite accumulation. The hollow-fiber membrane biofilm reactor
   could meet drinking-water standards for nitrate and nitrite while
   minimizing the amount of hydrogen wasted in the effluent when it was
   operated under hydrogen-limited conditions. For example, the system
   could achieve partial nitrate removals between 39\% and 92\%. effluent
   nitrate between 0.4 and 9.1 mg N/l, effluent nitrite less than 1 mg N/l.
   effluent hydrogen below 0.1 mg H-2/l. High fluxes of nitrate and
   hydrogen made it possible to have a short liquid retention time (42
   min), compared with 1-13 h in other studies with hydro-cri used as the
   electron donor for denitrification. The fluxes and concentrations for
   hydrogen, nitrate, and nitrite obtained in this study can be used as
   practical guidelines for system design. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Batch biological treatment of log yard run-off reduced biochemical
   oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and tannin and lignin
   (TL) concentration by 99\%, 80\%, and 90\%, respectively. Acute
   (Microtox) toxicity was decreased over treatment, from an initial EC50
   of 1.83\% to a value of 50.4\% after 48 h of treatment. Kinetics of
   biodegradation were determined using respirometry and fitted using the
   Monod and Tessier model. For the Monod model the maximum substrate
   uptake rate, and K-s values determined were 0.0038 mg BOD/mgVSS min, and
   1.4 mg/L, respectively.
   The efficacy of ozone as a pre- and post- biological treatment stage was
   also assessed. During ozone pretreatment, TL concentration and acute
   toxicity were rapidly reduced by 70\%, and 71\%, respectively.
   Pre-ozonation reduced BOD and COD concentration by <10\%, however a
   larger fraction of residual COD was non biodegradable after ozonation.
   Biologically treated effluent was subjected to ozonation to determine
   whether further improvements in effluent quality could be achieved. A
   reduction in COD and TL concentration was observed during ozonation,
   however no further improvement in toxicity was observed. Ozonation
   increased BOD by 38\%, due to conversion of COD to BOD. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{This research studied simultaneous uptake of anionic surfactants and
   micellar-solubilized organic contaminants by anion-exchange resins.
   Anionic surfactant molecules adsorbed onto the positively charged resin
   mainly through electrostatic attraction, while the micellar-solubilized
   contaminants were excluded front aqueous solutions once the remaining
   micelles could no longer solubilize them. Data suggest that the excess
   contaminants adsorbed onto the resin skeleton and admicelle layer formed
   oil the resin surface through hydrophobic interactions and eventually
   partitioned into the resin gel phase matrix. In batch adsorption, the
   contaminant solubilization capacity did not decrease linearly with
   respect to surfactant concentration decrease due to the increased
   Solution counterion activity during anion exchange, and caused
   ``delayed{''} contaminant uptake relative to that of the surfactant. No
   such effect occurred in continuous column adsorption, where the
   surfactant and contaminant breakthrough occurred simultaneously.
   Surfactant head and tail group properties, along with resin structure
   and particle size significantly affected surfactant and contaminant
   uptake rates. Relative to recovering the surfactant, the high exchange
   potential of the anionic surfactant prevented effective surfactant
   desorption, even at high electrolyte concentration and in the presence
   of a cosolvent. The resin matrix also had high affinity for the
   partitioned contaminant, and the contaminant elution from the resin
   seemed to be controlled by equilibrium partitioning. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper studies the feasibility of using
   3,3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide (TCS) as a metabolic uncoupler to
   reduce the sludge growth in activated sludge cultures. The results have
   confirmed that TCS is an effective chemical agent in limiting the sludge
   growth when its concentration is >0.4 mg/L. It was demonstrated that TCS
   was able to reduce sludge growth rate by around 40\% when the TCS
   concentration was 0.8mg/L. It was also revealed that substrate removal
   capability was not affected adversely by the presence of TCS when TCS
   was continuously dosed in a range of 0.5-1.0mg/L during the 30-day
   operation of activated sludge batch cultures. Such a sludge growth
   reduction is associated with the enhancement of microbial activities and
   an increase in the percentage of active bacteria over the total
   microbial population. In the 30-day operation of the cultures, the TCS
   dosing at a 1-mg/L level did not undermine the treatment performance in
   terms of the substrate removal efficiency. This work has demonstrated
   that it might be feasible to apply TCS in activated sludge systems to
   limit the excess sludge production. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Monthly sediment and interstitial water samples were collected in a
   shallow Chinese freshwater lake (Lake Donghu) from three areas to
   determine if alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) plays an important role
   in phosphorus cycling in sediment. The seasonal variability in the
   kinetics of APA and other relevant parameters were investigated from
   1995-1996. The phosphatase hydrolyzable phosphorus (PHP) fluctuated
   seasonally in interstitial water, peaking in the spring. A synchronous
   pattern was observed in chlorophyll a contents in surface water in
   general. The orthophosphate (o-P) concentrations in the interstitial
   water increased during the spring. An expected negative relationship
   between PHP and V(max) of APA is not evident in interstitial water. The
   most striking feature of the two variables is their co-occurring, which
   can be explained in terms of an induction mechanism. It is argued that
   phosphatase activity mainly contributes to the driving force of o-P
   regeneration from PHP in interstitial water, supporting the development
   of phytoplankton biomass in spring. The V(max) values in sediment
   increased during the summer, in Conjunction with lower K(m) values in
   interstitial water that suggest a higher affinity for the substrate. The
   accumulation of organic matter in the sediment could be traced back to
   the breakdown of the algal spring bloom, which may stimulate APA with
   higher kinetic efficiency, by a combination of the higher V(max) in
   sediments plus lower K(m) values in interstitial water, in Summer. In
   summary, a focus On phosphatase and its substrate in annual scale may
   provide a useful framework for the development of novel P cycling,
   possible explanations for the absence of a clear relationship between
   PHP and APA were PHP released from the sediment which induced APA, and
   the presence of kinetically higher APA both in sediment and interstitial

Abstract = {{The biosorption of copper by bacteria was studied by using ESR
   spectroscopy. Among bacteria tested, Arthrobacter nicotianae has the
   most excellent ability to sorb copper. The biosorption of copper by
   Arthrobacter cells was so rapid, affected by the solution pH, and obeys
   the Langmuir adsorption equilibrium. The electron spin resonance (ESR)
   spectra of Cu(II) in bacterial cells are axial type, having a major
   absorption to higher field at g(perpendicular to) and lesser absorption
   to lower field at g(parallel to) with four lines. The ESR parameters
   showed that Cu(II) in the cells has the tetragonally distorted
   octahedral structure with nitrogen and oxygen as ligand atoms, which
   suggests that most of copper in bacterial cells combined with amino acid
   residues in the cell surface proteins. The variation of spectral
   patterns among bacteria could explain as the change of ligand
   circumstances caused by the pH of the cell surface. (C) 2002 Elsevier

   Giardia lamblia and Giardia muris cysts, as determined by their
   infectivity in Mongolian gerbils and CD-1 mice, respectively. Reduction
   of cyst infectivity due to UV exposure was quantified by applying most
   probable number techniques. Controlled bench-scale, collimated-beam
   tests exposed cysts suspended in filtered natural water to light from a
   low-pressure UV lamp. Both G. lamblia and G. muris cysts showed similar
   sensitivity to UV light. At 3 mJ/cm(2), a dose 10-fold lower than what
   large-scale UV reactors may be designed to provide, >2-log(10) (99
   percent) inactivation was observed. These results, combined with
   previously published data showing, other protozoa and bacteria have
   similar, high sensitivity to UV light. establish that UV disinfection of

Abstract = {{The results obtained using an expert system to control an activated
   sludge process involving nutrient removal are reported. The study was
   conducted at a pilot plant using an Anaerobic/Anoxic/Oxic (A(2)/O)
   scheme for which a distributed control system was specially developed.
   The system allows various expert operational approaches to be developed
   with a view to minimize nitrogen levels in the outlet while using the
   minimum amount of energy. The proposed distributed control system is
   supervised by a Knowledge Based Expert System (KBES) constructed with
   G2(C) (a tool for expert system development) and permits the on-line
   implementation of every operating strategy of the experimental system. A
   set of experiments involving variable loads and flow-rates was carried
   out. It revealed that the amount of removed nitrogen could be increased
   by 11\% compared to the usual operating conditions. This increase
   resulted in a decrease in the amount of total nitrogen and ammonium
   nitrogen in the outlet by 49\% and 64\%, respectively. These
   improvements were achieved with little energy cost because the
   performance of the treatment plant was optimised using operating rules
   implemented in real time. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) should be Utilised
   by means of biological methods. The biodegradation of solid wastes can
   be intensified owing to application of the bioreactors. Estimation of
   the optimum values of the organic load is one of the most important
   tasks for the aerobic biodegradation processes. The kinetic model of
   biological oxidation of the organic wastes has been presented in this
   paper. The experiments were carried out in batch 6-1 working volume
   stirred tank bioreactors at constant temperature of 25degreesC. Initial
   total solids have been at the levels of 15, 19, 34, 55 and 66 gl(-1).
   The kinetics of microbial decomposition of organic substances was
   described by means of an unstructured model. The satisfactory time
   Courses for substrate chemical oxygen demand in the solid (CODS) and
   liquid phase (CODL) and biomass concentration (RNA) have been achieved.
   Also, the influence of the initial TS on the kinetics of the
   biodegradation process was investigated and the optimum value of initial
   TS for this type of processes was estimated at 34-55 gl(-1). (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Toxic effects and microcystin content from various extracts of a
   Planktothrix agardhii bloom and two different strains of Planktothrix
   agardhii, HUB 076, and NIVA 34 were investigated. Extracts were obtained
   with solvents of different polarity such as hexane, dichloromethane,
   methanol, and water. Additionally, different pre-treatments were used to
   break the cells before extraction. Acute toxicity was determined with
   the fairy shrimp Thamnocephalus platyurus, subchronic effects were
   detected in embryos and larvae of the zebrafish Danio rerio. The
   extracts affected the test species to a different extent. Effects were
   severe in polar extracts (water and methanol) of all strains tested.
   Although the strain NIVA 34 did not contain any microcystins, aqueous
   extracts of this strain showed the highest acute toxicity to the
   crustacean species tested (LC50 = 0.08 mg ml(-1)). In contrast aqueous
   extracts of the Planktothrix bloom containing high amounts of
   microcystins were less acutely toxic (LC50 = 0.46 mg ml(-1)). Our
   results indicate the existence of further toxic metabolites in different
   Planktothrix agardhii strains. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Oxygen concentration fields in a water body were Visualized by the
   fluorescence oxygen visualization (FOV) method. Pyrenebutyric acid (PBA)
   Was used as a flourescent indicator of oxygen, and an intensive charge
   coupled-device (ICCD) camera as an image detector. Sequential images
   (over 2000 images) of the oxygen concentration field around the surface
   water of the tank (1 x 1 x 0.75 m(3)) were produced during the 3 h
   experiment. From image processing. the accurate pathway of oxygen-rich,
   cold water at the water surface was also visualized. The amount of
   oxygen transferred through the air-water interface during the experiment
   was measured and the oxygen transfer coefficient (K-L) was determined as
   0.22 m/d, which was Much higher than that is expected in molecular
   diffusion. Results Suggest that vertical penetration of cold water was
   the main pathway of oxygen in the water body in the tank. The average
   velocity of cold water penetrating downward in water body was also
   measured from consecutive images and the value was 0.3-0.6 mm/s. The FOV
   method used in this research should have wide application in
   experimental fluid mechanics and can also provide a phenomenological
   description of oxygen transfer Under physically realizable natural
   conditions in lakes and reservoirs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A preliminary nutrient budget for Saguling Reservoir is reported as a
   first attempt to quantify the behaviour Of nutrients entering this
   reservoir. This work is part of a larger Indonesia-Australia
   collaborative research and training project. involving Padjadjaran
   University and Monash University, established to study nutrient dynamics
   in Saguling Reservoir.
   Saguling Reservoir, the first of a chain of three large reservoirs
   (Saguling, Cirata arid Jatilahur), built on the Citarum River in central
   Java. Was completed in 1985. It has already become highly polluted,
   particularly With domestic arid industrial effluent (organic matter,
   nutrients, heavy metals) from the Urban areas of Bandung (population 2
   million). The reservoir experiences major water quality problems.
   including excessive growths of floating plants. toxic cyanobacterial
   blooms arid regular fish-kills.
   The work reported in this paper shows that Saguling receives a very
   large nutrient load from the city of Bandung arid because of this, is
   highly eutrophic. It is unlikely that the water quality of Sahuling will
   improve until a substantial part of Bandung is sewered and adequate
   discharge controls are placed on the many industries in the region
   upstream of the reservoir. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The LC50 values (72 h) of 17beta-estradiol (E2), p-nonylphenol (NP) and
   bis-phenol-A (BPA) to adult male and female medaka were 3.5 and 3.5,
   0.85 and 0.87, and 6.8 and 8.3 mg L-1, respectively the LC50 values to
   embryos were 0.46, 0.13 and 5.1 mg L-1, respectively. The IC50 values
   for inhibition to egg hatching were 0.47, 0.85 and 9.0 mg L-1,
   respectively. These values were much higher than concentrations detected
   in river water in Japan and the chemicals were considered to have no
   lethal effect on the fish in an aquatic environment. Mature male medaka
   was continuously exposed to 0.005, 0.05 or 1.0 mug L-1 of E2, or to 0.1,
   10 or 100 mug L-1 of NP or BPA. Female specific proteins (FSP) were
   induced in the blood of male medaka that were exposed for 5 weeks to E2
   higher than 0.005 mug L-1 NP higher than 0.1 mug L-1, or BPA higher than
   10 mug L-1. Based on these ESP inducible concentrations and reported
   concentrations of E2, NP and BPA in Japanese river water, some river
   water contaminated by E2 or NP could be estimated as the ESP inducible

Abstract = {{Bentonite modified with short chain cationic surfactant might be the
   basis of a new approach to removing organic pollutants from water. The
   treatment process involves dispersing bentonite to the contaminated
   water and then adding a small cationic surfactant so as to result in
   flocs which are agglomerates of organobentonite and bound organic
   pollutants. The floes are then removed from the solution by
   sedimentation. Experimental results indicate that BTMA-bentonite
   displays a high affinity for phenol, possibly because phenol molecules
   interact favorably with the benzene ring in BTMA ion through increased
   pi-pi type interactions. Under appropriate operating conditions, 90\%
   phenol removal and nearly 100\% bentonite recovery could be achieved by
   the adsorption-flocculation process using BTMA-bentonite. Additionally,
   the insensitivity of the process to the changing ionic strength of the
   solution and rapid adsorption kinetics made adsorption-flocculation with
   BTMA-bentonite attractive for continuous treatment of large volumes of
   industrial wastewater. The bentonite may function as a recyclable
   surfactant support for the adsorption and subsequent combustion of
   organic pollutants. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Under steady-state conditions, a wastewater treatment plant usually has
   a satisfactory performance because these conditions are similar to
   design conditions. However, load variations constitute a large portion
   of the operating life of a treatment facility and most of the observed
   problems in complying with permit requirements occur during these load
   transients. During storm events upsets to the different physical and
   biological processes may take place in a wastewater treatment plant, and
   therefore, the ability to predict the hydraulic load to a treatment
   facility during such events is very beneficial for the optimization of
   the treatment process. Most of the hydrologic and hydraulic models
   describing sewage collection systems are deterministic. Such models
   require detailed knowledge of the system and usually rely on a large
   number of parameters, some of which are uncertain or difficult to
   determine. Presented in this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN)
   model that is used to make short-term predictions of wastewater inflow
   rate that enters the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant (GBWWTP), the
   largest plant in the Edmonton area (Alberta, Canada). The neural model
   uses rainfall data, observed in the collection system discharging to the
   plant, as inputs. The building process of the model was conducted in a
   systematic way that allowed the identification of a parsimonious model
   that is able to learn (and not memorize) from past data and generalize
   very well to unseen data that was used to validate the model. The neural
   network model gave excellent results. The potential of using the model
   as part of a real-time process control system is also discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{Naturally found coal is converted to coke which is suitable for
   metallurgical industries. Large quantities of liquid effluents produced
   contain a large amount of suspended solids, high COD, BOD, phenols,
   ammonia and other toxic substances which are causing serious pollution
   problem in the receiving water to which they are discharged. There are a
   large number of coke plants in the vicinity of Jharia Coal Field (JCF).
   Characteristics of the effluents have been evaluated. The present
   effluent treatment systems were found to be inadequate. Physico-chemical
   treatment has been considered as a suitable option for the treatment of
   coke plant effluents. Ammonia removal by synthetic zeolite, activated
   carbon for the removal of bacteria, viruses, refractory organics, etc.
   were utilized and the results are discussed. A scheme has been proposed
   for the complete physico-chemical treatment, which can be suitably
   adopted for the recycling, reuse and safe disposal of the treated
   effluent. Various unit process and unit operations involved in the
   treatment system have been discussed. The process may be useful on

Abstract = {{p-Nitrophenol (PNP) is a toxic compound that enters the environment
   during, manufacturing and processing of a variety of industrial
   products. This study demonstrates the use of inexpensive and durable
   nonwovens as a biomass retainer for the biological degradation of
   p-nitrophenol. An essential aspect of p-nitrophenol degradation was the
   cultivation of p-nitrophenol degrading biomass prior to its attachment
   on the nonwovens. Results of continuous flow experiments demonstrated
   that using the nonwovens could attain consistent high-rate p-nitrophenol
   degradation. 500 mg-PNP/L was completely degraded at a hydraulic
   retention time of 11 It. Specific and volumetric p-nitrophenol loading
   rates were determined to be 165mg-PNP/g-MLSS/d and 1.6g-PNP/L/d,
   respectively. Nitrite released from p-nitrophenol breakdown was not
   completely nitrified to nitrate. Characteristics of p-nitrophenol
   degrading sludge were also investigated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{In the present study the treatment efficiency of different AOPs
   (O-3/OH-, H2O2/UV-C and TiO2/UV-A) were compared for the oxidation of
   simulated reactive dyebath effluent containing a mixture of
   monochlorotriazine type reactive dyes and various dye auxiliary
   chemicals at typical concentrations encountered in exhausted reactive
   dyebath liquors. A(525) (Color), UV280 (aromaticity) and TOC removal
   rates were assessed to screen the most appropriate oxidative process in
   terms of reactive dyebath effluent treatment. Special emphasis was laid
   on the effect of reaction pH and applied oxidant (O-3, H2O2) dose on the
   observed reaction kinetics. It was established that the investigated
   AOPs were negatively affected by the Na2CO3 content (=867mg/L) which is
   always present at high concentrations in dyehouse effluents since it is
   applied as a pH buffer and dye fixation agent during the reactive dyeing
   process. The ozonation reaction exhibited almost instantaneous
   decolorization kinetics and a reasonable TOC reduction rate. It appeared
   to be stable under the investigated advanced oxidation conditions and
   outranked the other studied AOPs based on the above mentioned criteria.
   Besides, the electrical energy requirements based on the EE/O parameter
   (the electrical energy required per order of pollutant removal in 1 m(3)
   wastewater) was calculated for the homogenous AOPs in terms of
   decolorization kinetics. In view of the electrical energy efficiency,
   ozonation and H2O2/UV-C oxidation at the selected treatment conditions
   appear to be promising candidates for full-scale dyehouse effluent
   decolorization. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Drinking water denitrification performance of a bench scale membrane
   bio-reactor (MBR) was investigated as function of hydraulic and
   biological parameters. The reactor was a stirred tank and operated both
   in batch and continuous mode. The mixed denitrifying culture used in the
   batch mode tests was derived from the mixed liquor of a wastewater
   treatment plant in Erzincan province in Turkey. But the culture used in
   the continuous mode tests was that obtained from the batch mode tests at
   the end of the denitrification process. The nitrate contaminated water
   treated was separated from the mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS)
   containing active mixed denitrifying culture and other organic
   substances by a membrane of 0.2 mum average pore diameter. The results
   indicated that the use of a membrane module eliminated the need for
   additional post treatment processes for the removal of MLSS from the
   product water. Concentration of nitrite and that of MLSS in the membrane
   effluent was below the detectable limits. Optimum carbon to nitrogen
   (C/N) ratio was found to be 2.2 in batch mode tests. Depending on the
   process conditions, it was possible to obtain denitrification capacities
   based on the reactor effluent and membrane effluent up to 0.18 kg m(-3)
   day(-1) and 2.44 kg m(-2) day(-1) NO3--N, respectively. The variation of
   the removal capacity with reactor dilution rate and membrane permeate
   flux was the same for two different degrees of {[}MLSS](0)/{[}NO3--N](0)
   (mass) ratios of 25.15 and 49.33. The present M BR was able to produce a
   drinking water with NO3--N concentration of less than 4 ppm from a water
   with NO3--N contamination level of 367 ppm equivalent to a NO3--N load
   of 0.310 kg m(-3) day(-1). The results showed that MBR system used was
   able to offer NO3--N removals of up to 98.5\%. It was found that the
   membrane limiting permeate flux increased with increasing MLSS
   concentration. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of production and degradation of poly-p-hydroxybutyrate
   (PHB) by a mixed activated sludge culture growing on acetate was studied
   in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). Occasionally a very high amount of
   acetate was added to the steady state system in order to obtain high PHB
   concentrations in the cells (fPHB). This made it possible to follow PHB
   production and degradation over a wide range of f(PHB)-data (between 0
   and 0.8 Cmol/Cmol). The results were compared with data available in
   literature and with equations derived by metabolic modeling. This led to
   some remarkable observations. For the feast period, the ratio
   q(PHB)(feast)/-q(Ac)(feast) (specific PHB production rate over specific
   acetate uptake rate) was used to indicate which fraction of the
   substrate is stored. Experimentally and theoretically it was shown that
   this ratio has a constant value for dynamically fed systems operated at
   a sludge retention time (SRT) > 2d. This value is 0.6 Cmol/Cmol under
   aerobic conditions and 0.4-0.5 Cmol/Cmol under anoxic conditions,
   irrespective of the specific growth rate of the biomass and the specific
   acetate uptake rate in the feast period. Degradation of internal stored
   PHB could be described with a first order degradation rate with respect
   to the PHB content of the cells. Degradation of PHB appeared to be
   independent of the type of electron acceptor present in the system and
   independent of the SRT of the system. The kinetic descriptions can be
   used to predict PHB production and consumption in general in dynamic fed
   wastewater treatment systems, and they provide some trends for modeling
   purposes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the paper is to assess the experimental errors arising from
   the operation of a closed respirometer using autotrophic biomass. A
   closed, intermittent-flow device has been set-up for the measurement of
   oxygen uptake rate (OUR) and parameter calibration. After describing the
   device structure and operation, the factors affecting accuracy have been
   assessed. Inaccuracies may be caused by two groups of parameters: design
   parameters, including flow rate, volume, sampling time, numerical
   algorithm, sample injection and environmental parameters, concerning the
   physicochemical conditions of the experiment, such as unwanted oxygen
   transfer, pH, and the influence of sludge condition on ``start-up{''}
   behaviour. It is shown to what extent each of them affects the final
   accuracy of the OUR measurement. In the second part of the paper, the
   respirometric data are used to calibrate a two-step nitrification model
   and their impact on the accuracy of the estimation of model parameters
   is assessed. Confidence limits are derived for the identifiable
   parameter combinations and the practical identifiability assessed with
   the aid of trajectory sensitivity analysis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A seasonal fluctuation pattern was observed in membrane filtration
   resistance by Chlorella algae cultured in open ponds in the tropical
   environment. In order to investigate the causes of this phenomenon,
   Chlorella was cultivated under controlled conditions and the cake
   resistance was measured by batch filtration in dead-end mode. The
   filtration resistance was found to be a function of environmental
   conditions. Algae could grow favourably and offered low specific cake
   resistance (R-cs) on the order of 10(11) m/g for the culture temperature
   from 28degreesC to 35degreesC. The algal growth was inhibited and the
   specific cake resistance increased to the order of 10(12) m/g below or
   above this optimum temperature range, Strong solar radiation, coupled
   with high temperatures, also inhibited the growth of algae and resulted
   in higher specific cake resistance, The specific cake resistance of
   algae cultured at different temperatures increased with the amount of
   the extracellular organic matter (EOM) extracted by 0.1 N NaOH. Hence
   EOM, rather than bacteria present in the mono-algal culture, was
   considered to be the primary factor affecting the cake resistance. The
   specific cake resistance increased drastically after actively growing
   cells were stored in nutrient-free water under dark conditions. However,
   the resistance was slightly decreased when the algal cells were stored
   in NSIII nutrient media in a dark room, indicating the effect of
   nutrient availability on the change of the specific cake resistance
   under the light-limiting conditions. EOM extracted from the cells kept
   in the nutrient-free water contained less sugar than the fresh culture,
   whereas the EOM extracted from the cells stored in the NSIII media
   contained more sugar. The molecular distribution of the EOM shifted from
   below 1,000 kDa before storage to more than 2,000 kDa after storage in
   both the nutrient-free and NSIII media. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Two streams of wastewater from the Kraft Pulp and Paper Mills at Webuye
   are released from the pulping, bleaching and paper pressing departments.
   One stream is made up of clear wastewater and the second is made up of
   turbid wastewater. The wastewaters from the mills are treated using
   oxidation ponds, after which the treated wastewater is discharged into
   the River Nzoia. The wastewater was analysed for Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn,
   Ca, K, Mg and Na. The results are that the concentrations of Ca and Na
   significantly increased in the treated wastewater, The concentrations of
   Cd, Pb, Zn, K and Mg also increased in the treated wastewater, though
   not significantly. The concentrations of Cr, Cu and Ni decreased in the
   treated wastewater but not significantly. Mass loadings of the metals
   discharged into River Nzoia were calculated, It was found that the mean
   mass loading of two metals (Ca and Na) significantly increased in the
   treated wastewater. Five metals (Cd, Pb, Zn, K and Mg) increased in the
   treated wastewater although not significantly. Three metals (Cr, Cu and
   Ni) decreased in the treated wastewater but the decrease was not
   significant. The concentrations of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn were all above
   the limits set by EC for drinking water. These findings pose serious
   questions of the effectiveness of oxidation ponds system to safeguard
   the receptor against pollutants from the pulp and paper industry at
   Webuye. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In preparation to field experiments with in situ mobilized colloids, a
   set of pilot scale aquifer tank experiments was performed to gain an
   insight into the mass transfer of several heavy metal ions and
   pentachlorophenol (PCP) in a heterogeneous gravel aquifer and a
   homogeneous sandy aquifer. The experiments simulate a spill of dissolved
   contaminants and their subsequent transport with in situ mobilized
   colloids that are not yet in equilibrium with the contaminant.
   Contaminants with a weak tendency to adsorb to the stationary sediment
   matrix, e.g., PCP, establish a dynamic equilibrium with the mobile
   colloidal phase. The fraction of contaminants. In contrast, for
   contaminants that strongly adsorb to the sediment matrix, the fraction
   associated with colloids increases with increasing flow distance. In
   either case, the filtration of colloids is the limiting factor for the
   colloidal mass transfer. It is also shown that the recovery rates
   decrease rapidly within both sediments, and that the transport
   parameters (flow velocity, dispersivity) are only representative for the
   mobile fraction of the contaminant. On the given experimental scale,
   there was no evidence of a preferred colloidal transport, or even a
   transport of colloids ahead of the conservative tracer. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{This study reports the biosorption of Cr(VI) by chemically modified
   biomass of Rhizopus nigricans and the possible mechanism of Cr
   complexation to the adsorbent. The cell wall of this fungus possesses
   strong complexing property to effectively remove Cr(VI) anions from
   solution and wastewater. The mechanism of Cr adsorption by R. nigricans
   was ascertained by chemical modifications of the dead biomass followed
   by FTIR spectroscopic analysis of the cell wall constituents. Treatment
   of the biosorbent with mild alkalies (0.01 N NaOH and ammonia solution)
   and formaldehyde (10\%. w/v) deteriorated the biosorption efficiency.
   However, extraction of the biomass powder in acids (0.1 N HCl and
   H2SO4), alcohols (50\% v/v, CH3OH and C2H5OH.) and acetone (50\%, v/v)
   improved the Cr uptake capacity. Reaction of the cell wall amino groups
   with acetic anhydride reduced the biosorption potential drastically.
   Blocking of the-COOH groups by treatment with water soluble carbodiimide
   also resulted in initial lag in Cr binding. Biomass modification
   experiments conducted using Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB),
   Polyethylenimine (PEI), and Amino Propyl Trimethoxy Silane (APTS)
   improved the biosorption efficiency to exceptionally high levels. The
   FTIR spectroscopic analysis of the native, Cr bound and the other types
   of chemically modified biomass indicated the involvement of amino groups
   of Rhizopus cell wall in Cr binding. The adsorption data of the native
   and the most effectively modified biomass were evaluated by the
   Freundlich and the Langmuir adsorption isotherms and the
   possible,adsorption phenomena are also discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Ozonation of 11 naphthalene sulfonic acids (NSA) in the aqueous solution
   was studied by bubbling at 31degreesC at an ozone dose rate of 5.56 mg
   min(-1) l(-1). COD, TOC and BOD5 of these compounds were tested. It was
   found that COD and TOC can be removed effectively by ozonation as
   expected. More than 40\% COD of compounds No. 1(2-amino-1-NSA), No. 5
   (1-hydroxy-7-amino-5-NSA), No. 6 (6-hydroxy-1-NSA), No. 8
   (6-amino-1,4-naptithalene disulfonic acid) and No. 11
   (1-hydroxy-6-amino-3-NSA) has been eliminated at an ozone dosage of 5.56
   mg min(-1) l(-1) for 2 h. Although TOC removal was very different, a
   good biodegradability was reached for NSAs with an average ozone
   consumption of 3.0 mg l(-1) for a TOC0 concentration of 100 mg l(-1).
   Ozonation and biotreatment should be good alternatives for these
   compounds, especially after 20\% TOC reduction and TOC removal were more
   sensitive in predicting an increase in biodegradability during
   ozonation, than that of COD. NSAs are similar in their behavior with
   reference to ozone consumption. In order to obtain a good
   biodegradability of NSAs at a TOC0 concentration of 100 mg l(-1), an
   ozone consumption between 2.0 and 4.0 mg mg(-1) DeltaCOD is needed for
   this setup and 3.0 mg O-3 mg(-1) TOC0 requirement may be more practical
   in predicting the biological behavior of naphthalene compounds. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The surface of activated carbon cloth (ACC), based on polyacrylonitrile
   fibre as a precursor, was oxidised using nitric acid, ozone and
   electrochemical oxidation to enhance cadmium ion exchange capacity.
   Modified adsorbents were physically and chemically characterised by pH
   titration, direct titration, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, elemental
   analysis, surface area and porosimetry, and scanning electron
   microscopy. BET surface area decreased after oxidation, however, the
   total ion exchange capacity increased by a factor of approximately 3.5
   compared to the commercial as received ACC. A very significant increase
   in cadmium uptake, by a factor of 13, was observed for the
   electrochemically oxidised ACC. Equilibrium sorption isotherms were
   determined at pH 4, 5 and 6 and these showed that cadmium uptake
   increased with increasing pH. There was clear evidence of physical
   damage to ozone-oxidised fibre, however, acid and electrochemically
   oxidised samples were completely stable. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Several potential mechanisms of surfactant-induced inhibition of
   pentachloro phenol (PCP) biodegradation were tested using a pure
   bacterial culture of Sphingomonas chlorophenolicum sp. Strain RA2. PCP
   degradation, glucose degradation, and oxygen uptake during endogenous
   conditions and during glucose degradation were measured for batch
   systems in the presence of the nonionic surfactant Tergitol NP-10
   (TNP10). TNP10 did not exert toxicity on RA2 as measured by dissolved
   oxygen uptake rates under endogenous conditions and glucose
   biodegradation rates. TNP10 reduced the substrate inhibition effect of
   PCP at high PCP concentrations, resulting in faster PCP degradation
   rates at higher concentrations of TNP10. Calculations of a micelle
   partition coefficient (K-mic) show that PCP degradation rates in the
   presence of surfactant can be explained by accounting for the amount of
   PCP available to the cell in the aqueous solution. A model is discussed
   based on these results where PCP is sequestered into micelles at high
   TNP10 concentrations to become less available to the bacterial cell and
   resulting in observed inhibition. Under substrate toxicity conditions,
   the same mechanism serves to increase the rate of PCP biodegradation by
   reducing aqueous PCP concentrations to less toxic levels. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{A hydro-chemical study has been carried out on a 37-km stretch of the
   River Ganga from Deoprayag to Rishikesh (India) during the period from
   April 1999 to March 2000. The assessment of sediment and nutrient load
   has been considered to evaluate the current state of pollution through
   real time measurements. The values of pH and conductance are well within
   the limits prescribed for drinking water. The maximum suspended sediment
   concentrations of 1405 and 2002 mg/L were recorded at Deoprayag and
   Rishikesh, respectively, during the rainy season. A large amount of
   sediment and nutrient load is transported from the watershed during the
   rainy season. Concentrations of NO3-N and NH3-N at Deoprayag varied from
   0.30 to 0.50 and 0.02 to 0.12 mg/L, respectively, depending on season.
   Examination of the results showed clearly that NH3-N was generally low
   as compared to NO3-N. Depending on the pH and temperature of soils, NH4+
   and NO3- ions are produced in the watershed through ammonification and
   nitrification of organic matter and mobilized into rivers through
   run-off. Dissolved N and P from fertilizer application, sewage and
   non-point source run-off contribute significant quantities of these
   nutrients in river water. The nitrate and phosphate are transported from
   the cropland either by being adsorbed on to soil particles that are
   subsequently eroded, or dissolved in runoff water from agricultural
   land. The data generated through the study will be useful for
   development and management planning of the hilly watershed. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Aliphatic hydrocarbons were assessed in runoff and waste waters from an
   urban catchment located in Paris. Runoff were sampled from different
   types of urban surfaces (11 roofs representing four different covering
   materials, two courtyards and six streets). Waste water samples were
   collected at the catchment outlet during dry and wet weather periods as
   well. This paper gives an overview of the results on the concentration
   and distribution points of view for both the particulate and the
   dissolved phases. Results were discussed on the basis of the median.
   Accordingly, the temporal variability was taken into account. Thus, the
   concentration medians ranged from 345 to 827, from 297 to 790, and from
   393 to 1359 mug L-1 in the roof, courtyard and street samples,
   respectively. The levels found at the catchment outlet during dry and
   wet weather periods were of the same order of magnitude, i.e. 700
   muL(-1). The particulate phase represented 85\% of the total aliphatic
   hydrocarbon content whatever the sample. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1286-1296}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Synthetic solutions that emulate the major ion compositions of natural
   waters are useful in experiments aimed at understanding biogeochemical
   processes. Standard recipes exist for preparing synthetic analogues of
   seawater, with its relatively constant composition, but, due to the
   diversity of freshwaters, a range of compositions and recipes is
   required. Generic protocols are developed for preparing synthetic
   freshwaters of any desired composition. The major problems encountered
   in preparing hard and soft waters include dissolving sparingly soluble
   calcium carbonate, ensuring that the ionic components of each
   concentrated stock solution cannot form an insoluble salt and dealing
   with the supersaturation of calcium carbonate in many hard waters. For
   acidic waters the poor solubility of aluminium salts requires attention.
   These problems are overcome by preparing concentrated stock solutions
   according to carefully designed reaction paths that were tested using a
   combination of experiment and equilibrium modeling. These stock
   solutions must then be added in a prescribed order to prepare a final
   solution that is brought into equilibrium with the atmosphere. The
   example calculations for preparing hard, soft and acidic freshwater
   surrogates with major ion compositions the same as published analyses,
   are presented in a generalized fashion that should allow preparation of
   any synthetic freshwater according to its known analysis. (C) 2002

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{For many years, calorimetric measurements have been used for
   understanding, modelling, controlling, and optimising chemical
   reactions, Calorimetry could be as well utilised to investigate
   biological processes, which however, involve very small amount of heat
   and therefore require very sensitive instruments. For this purpose, a
   Mettler-Toledo RCl (Reaction calorimeter) was modified, changing both
   hardware and software, increasing its resolution up to 510 mW/l. Such
   sensitivity allows the monitoring of aerobic and anoxic processes.
   This paper points out the excellent agreement between calorimetric and
   respirometric data, obtained simultaneously under aerobic conditions
   using activated sludge from a lab-scale scale reactor.
   Heat production rate can be directly converted in oxygen uptake rate by
   means of a correlation factor, whose value is approximately the same for
   all aerobic respiratory metabolisms. Taking into account this factor,
   calorimetric data were introduced in a chemical oxygen demand based
   model and processed for the estimation of kinetic parameters of
   heterotrophic biomass.
   Aerobic heterotrophic, denitrifying, and autotrophic nitrifying activity
   were determined by specific calorimetric tests. The effect of
   potentially toxic or inhibitory substances on the activity of all
   microbial communities was as well pointed out in these measurements. (C)

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Iron-based layered double hydroxides (M-a(2+) Fe-b(3+)
   (OH)(2(a+b))CO(3)(b/2)(2-)mH(2)O) were synthesized. Removal of phosphate
   by the compounds was studied from the viewpoint of buffering pH effect
   of the compounds and buffering capacity of solution. The compounds
   released metal cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, Fe3+) and/or their hydroxides
   responding to various water environments due to their buffering pH
   function. The released cations and/or hydroxides worked effectively as
   coagulants for the phosphate removal. The removal of phosphate depended
   on the buffering capacity of the solution that is the function of the
   solution pH and the concentration of phosphate. The removal of phosphate
   from the solution with small buffering capacity followed a Langmuir-type
   isotherm. The removal of phosphate from the solution with larger
   buffering capacity was largely increased. The removal of phosphate by
   the compounds was analyzed based on the model describing the buffering
   pH effect of the compounds from which the amount of released cations
   (C-B) can be determined. The removal was well correlated with the amount
   of dissolution of the compounds, C-B. The mechanism of phosphate removal
   was examined based on the removal efficiency (triol of removed
   phosphate/mol of released alkali). The efficiencies showed below one in
   the solution with large buffering capacity and above one in the solution
   with small buffering capacity. The efficiency below one showed the
   removal of phosphate through coagulation by the released metal cations
   and hydroxides. The successful removal of dilute phosphate (0.2 mg P/l)
   from the drain water was also demonstrated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{An equilibrium model for describing the relationships between important
   parameters for heavy metal sorption by algae was derived through a
   thermodynamics approach. In this model, both the removal efficiency of
   heavy metal and metal adsorption per unit algal biomass are considered
   to be simple functions of the ratio of algal biomass concentration to
   the initial metal concentration for selected conditions, i.e. as at
   constant pH and temperature. The model was found to fit the experimental
   results well (judged by the correlation-regression coefficient, R-2),
   for the adsorption of cadmium, copper, lead and zinc by two algal
   species, Oocystis sp. (both living and non-living) and Chlorococcum sp.
   The applicability of the model was also supported by the reprocessed
   results of experimental data given in the literature, i.e. for the metal
   species, Cd, Pb, Cu and Ag, the algal species, Chlorella vulgaris,
   Scenedesmus quadricauda and Cladophora crispata, and both batch and
   continuous fixed-bed reactors. It was also demonstrated that the model
   could be applied over a broad range of pH for cadmium and copper
   adsorption by Oocystis sp, However, the model was not applicable at very
   low and high pH levels, due to negligible adsorption and precipitation,
   respectively. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The applicability of cow bone as a seed material in hydroxyapatite
   crystallization was investigated in this research. Seed crystal used for

   solution by batch experiment. The experimental results showed that a
   good phosphorus removal could be achieved by cow bone crystal seeding.
   The phosphorus removal rate with various calcium concentrations and pHs
   could be predicted from high relationships between residual phosphorus
   concentration and pH (after reaction). The effects of alkalinity,

   examined by rate constant analysis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This work presents data showing the kinetic improvement afforded by
   ultrasound pretreatment and illustrates the physical and chemical
   changes that take place at the iron surface. First-order rate constants
   improved as much as 78\% with 2h of ultrasound pretreatment. Scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) and surface area analysis were used for
   confirmation of the physical changes that take place after ultrasound
   was used on iron surfaces exposed to a variety of conditions. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy was used to determine chemical surface
   characteristics before and after ultrasound use. SEM and surface area
   analysis showed that ultrasound use clears the iron surface of debris
   increasing the surface area up to 169\%. In addition, exposure to
   ultrasound alters ratios of surface species, such as adventitious carbon
   to carbonyl carbon and iron to oxygen, and removed hydroxides thus
   making the iron more reactive to reductive dehalogenation. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a monitoring and modelling programme,
   carried out to study the processes occurring in gully pots during dry
   weather. The monitoring programme involved estimation of the change in
   gully pot liquor quality, under field and laboratory conditions. The
   contents (i.e. liquor and sludge) of pots draining five different types
   of roads were monitored over dry periods in the winter and summer. A
   bench scale study was carried out to study the influence of temperature
   variations and sludge digestion by-products on gully liquor quality. The
   change in quality was measured in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD),
   dissolved oxygen (DO) and ammonium concentration. The trends for change
   in COD and DO, were found to be broadly similar for all road types.
   However, ammonium transformation was found to follow different patterns
   at different locations. Several dry weather processes, such as COD
   decay, ammonium transformation, oxygen depletion and uptake by sludge,
   oxygen transfer from the atmosphere and benthic release of COD, have
   been identified. Other processes, found to take place during dry
   weather, include development of a scum layer over the surface of the
   gully liquor and sludge bulking. A model is proposed which can predict
   the change in gully liquor quality in terms of COD, DO and ammonium
   concentrations. Data collected during the study has been used to
   successfully calibrate and verify the model. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1360-1368}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a model is developed for the retention of organic
   molecules with a given nanofiltration membrane at different pressures as
   a function of the molecular weight. The Spiegler-Kedem transport
   equations were used to derive the reflection coefficient, the maximal
   retention that would theoretically be obtained at infinite transmembrane
   pressure, from experimental retention values for a large set of
   molecules with the effective diameter of the molecule as a size
   parameter. Secondly, the pore size distribution of the membrane is
   derived from the experimental reflection coefficients. This allows to
   calculate the reflection coefficient for a molecule with a given
   effective diameter. Since this parameter is not readily available, a
   correlation between the effective diameter and the molecular weight has
   been established and introduced in the model equations.
   Subsequently, the contribution of diffusion in the transport of
   molecules through the membrane was evaluated by introducing a membrane
   diffusion parameter, which was determined experimentally for the
   membranes NF70, NTR 7450 and UTC-20.
   Finally, the pore size distribution, the diffusion parameter and the
   experimental water flux through the membrane were used to calculate the
   retention as a function of the molecular weight and pressure for the
   same three membranes. This allows to determine retention curves at
   different pressures, and to calculate the variation of the MWC with
   pressure. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ionizing radiation has been proved as a promising method for the
   degradation of the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). The
   gamma-radiolytic decomposition and chloride formation follows an
   apparent first order kinetic, k(de)/k(Cl) = 3. For complete removal of
   500 muM 2,4-D, a dose of 4 kGy is required. Phenolic intermediates
   (2,4-dichlorophenol, the isomers 2-chloro-4-hydroxy- and
   4-chloro-2-hydroxy phenoxyacetic acid and three hydroxylation products
   of 2,4-D) are formed, Using oxygen saturation during irradiation, they
   are removed again with a dose of 4kGy. For the formation of the main
   organic product acetic acid a reaction mechanism is discussed. Oxygen
   concentration enhances strongly fragmentation and mineralization. A
   reduction of 36\% TOC could be achieved. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption for the
   removal of natural organic matter and trihalomethanes from Ivedik Water
   Treatment Plant of Ankara City is investigated. Freundlich Isotherm
   constants K and n were determined as 17.61 and 1.66, respectively.
   Bench-scale GAC columns were run with empty bed contact times (EBCT)
   varying from 0.40 to 2.67 min to evaluate adsorption performance. 50\%
   exhaustion values were used for comparison. The treated volumes of water
   increased with EBCT, showing a linear increase in GAC service life.
   Correspondingly, the carbon usage rate decreased. The capacities
   calculated by the isotherm equation and achieved by columns were also
   compared. The column capacities were within 43-65\% of the isotherm
   capacities at complete breakthrough. However, they were only within
   8-17\% of the isotherm capacities at 50\% breakthrough. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{This paper describes the variation of the methane yield during the
   start-up period of an anaerobic fluidized bed reactor. After a lag
   phase, with acclimatized sludge, the methane yield increased with time
   during biofilm development up to the theoretical steady yield value,
   reported to be around 0.351 CH4/g CODdeg. The establishment of the
   biofilm required a high consumption of organic material through the
   microbial synthesis (anabolism), thereby reducing the proportion of
   substrate converted to methane. As a result, this yield could be an
   indirect metabolic parameter for evaluating a start-up operation. It
   could provide vital information about bacterial fixation processes and
   is easy to be applied to any biofilm reactor, such as anaerobic filters,
   where biomass sampling is impracticable. Monitoring this parameter could
   also give useful dynamic information about the different steps of
   colonization and biomass attachment, which could be used to improve the
   start-up performance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the progress in preparing and using ferrate(VI) salt
   as an oxidant and coagulant for water and wastewater treatment. The
   literature revealed that due to its unique properties (viz. strong
   oxidizing potential and simultaneous generation of ferric coagulating
   species), ferrate(VI) salt can disinfect microorganisms, partially
   degrade and/or oxidise the organic and inorganic impurities, and remove
   suspended/colloidal particulate materials in a single dosing and mixing
   unit process, However, these findings have not yet lead to the
   full-scale application of ferrate(VI,) in the water industry owing to
   difficulties associated with the relatively low yield of ferrate(VI),
   the instability of the chemical depending on its method of preparation,
   and the lack of adequate studies that have demonstrated its capabilities
   and advantages over existing water and wastewater treatment methods.
   Fundamental study is thus required to explore the new preparation
   methods focusing on increasing the production yield and product's
   stability and avoiding using hypochlorite or chlorine as the oxidant.
   Also, the application of ferrate(VI) in drinking water treatment has not
   been studied systematically and future work in this field is
   recommended. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) communities exhibit phosphorus (P)
   removal mechanisms not found in wetlands dominated by emergent
   macrophytes. This includes direct assimilation of water column P by the
   plants and pH-mediated P coprecipitation with calcium carbonate (CaCO3).
   Recognizing that SAV might be employed to increase the performance of
   treatment wetlands, we investigated P removal in mesocosms (3.7 m(2))
   stocked with a mixture of taxa common to the region: Najas
   guadalupensis, Ceratophyllum demersum, Chara spp. and Potamogeton
   illinoensis. Three sets of triplicate mesocosms received agricultural
   runoff from June 1998 to February 2000 at nominal hydraulic retention
   times (HRTs) of 1.5, 3.5 or 7.0 days. Mean total P (TP) loading rates
   were 19.7, 8.3 and 4.5 g/m(2)/yr. After eight months of operation, N.
   guadalupensis dominated the standing crop biomass and P storage, whereas
   C. demersum exhibited the highest tissue P content. Chara spp. was
   prominent only in the 7.0-day HRT treatments while P. illinoensis
   largely disappeared. Inflow soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) (10-163
   mug/L) was reduced consistently to near the detection limit (2 mug/L) in
   the 3.5- and 7.0-day HRT treatments, and to a mean of 9 mug/L in the
   1.5-day HRT treatment. The mean inflow TP concentration (107 mug/L) was
   reduced to 52, 29 and 23 mug/L in the 1.5-, 3.5- and 7.0-day HRT
   treatments, respectively. Total P concentrations in new sediment (rnean=
   641, 408 and 459 mg/kg in the 1.5-, 3.5-, and 7.0-day HRT mesocosms,
   respectively) were much higher than in the muck Soil used to stock the
   mesocosms (236 mg/ kg). The calcium content of new sediment was twice
   that of the muck soil (16.5\% vs. 7.6\%), demonstrating that CaCO3
   production and, perhaps, coprecipitation of P occurred. We observed no
   nocturnal remobilization of SRP despite diel fluctuations in pH and
   dissolved oxygen. Mean outflow TP (21 mug/L) from a 147 ha SAV wetland
   (4-day nominal HRT) was similar to mean outflow TP in the 3.5-day and
   7.0-day HRT treatments, The mesocosms adequately mimicked P removal and
   other important characteristics of the larger system and can be used to
   address research questions regarding treatment performance of full-scale
   SAV wetlands. Available data suggest that the incorporation of SAV
   communities into the stormwater treatment areas may benefit Everglades
   restoration. (C) 20022 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biofilm formation on the optical ports of cameras and underwater sensors
   is the primary cause of their reduced useful deployment time. The use of
   a transparent hydrogel coating containing the cationic surfactant
   benzalkonium chloride has been shown to extend the deployment times for
   up to 12 weeks for these instruments. In order to predict the effective
   lifetime of these coatings it was necessary to obtain the diffusion
   coefficient of the benzalkonium chloride used in the coatings.
   Benzalkonium chloride can have different alkyl chain lengths ranging
   from C8H17 to C18H37 with chain length greatly affecting its chemical
   properties. The benzalkonium chloride materials investigated here were
   mixtures of C12H25 and C14H29 as well as C14H29 on its own. These
   materials were selected for their proven biofilm resistant qualities.
   The diaphragm diffusion cell technique was investigated for its
   applicability to the measurement of diffusion coefficients of molecules
   with surfactant properties and the ability to form micelles. The method
   was found to be satisfactory for the cationic surfactant benzalkonium
   chloride. The average value of the membrane cell integral diffusion
   coefficient (D) over bar was 7.78 x 10(-6)cm(2) s(-1) at 25degreesC and
   there was no significant effect of alkyl chain length on the measured
   value of (D) over bar. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Certain xenoestrogens, namely bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F (BPF),
   butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and
   di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), were measured in various compartments
   (surface water, sediments, sewage treatment plant effluents, sewage
   sludge, dump water, liquid manure) in order to contribute to a better
   understanding of exposure to these compounds in different environments.
   Hundred and sixteen surface-water samples and 35 sediments from rivers,
   lakes and channels, 39 sewage effluents, and 38 sewage sludges were
   collected in Germany. Furthermore, ten liquid manure, two waste-dump and
   two compost-runoff water samples were also analysed.
   BPA measurements showed low concentrations from 0.0005 to 0.41 mug L-1
   in surface water, in sewage effluents from 0.018 to 0.702 mugL(-1), in
   sediments from 0.01 to 0.19 mg kg(-1) and in sewage sludge from 0.004 to
   1.363 mg kg(-1) dw. Measured concentrations of BPF were clearly lower
   than BPA in all environmental media.
   DEHP dominated the phthalate concentrations, which ranged from 0.33 to
   97.8 mugL(-1) (surface water), 1.74 to 182 mug L-1 (sewage effluents),
   27.9 to 154 mg kg(-1) dw (sewage sludge) and 0.21 to 8.44 mg kg(-1)
   (sediment). DBP was found only in minor concentrations and BBP, only in
   a few samples in low amounts. Very high concentrations of BPA and
   phthalates were confirmed in waste dump water and compost water samples
   as well as in the liquid manure samples. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The biofilm in a full-scale nitrifying trickling filter (NTF) treating
   municipal wastewater has been investigated with microbiological methods
   using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with 16S rRNA
   oligonucleotide probes in combination with confocal laser scanning
   microscopy (CLSM) and mathematical modeling using a dynamic multispecies
   biofilm reactor model, Ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were found to
   belong to the genus Nitrosomonas at different depths in the NTF at every
   sampling occasion, corresponding to different long-term operational
   conditions for the NTF. Both the measurements and the corresponding
   simulated predictions showed the same general trend of a decrease with
   filter depth of the amount of biofilm, the proportion of AOB to all
   bacteria and the total amount of AOB. The latter decreased by several
   times from top to bottom of the NTF. Measurements and simulations of
   potential ammonium oxidizing activity in the biofilm also showed a
   decreasing activity with depth in the NTF, which generally was operating
   at close to complete nitrification. However, no difference was observed
   when the activity was normalized to the amount of biofilm, despite
   decreasing proportions of AOB to all bacteria with depth in the NTF.
   This could be explained by diffusion limitations in the biofilm from the
   upper parts of the NTF according to the biofilm reactor model. The
   relatively good agreement between the simulations and the measurements
   shows that the kind of biofilm reactor model used can qualitatively
   describe an averaged behavior and averaged composition of the biofilm in
   the reactor. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Four ligninolytic fungi, Trametes modesta, Trametes hirsuta, Trametes
   versicolor and Sclerotium rolfsii, were compared for their ability to
   produce laccases. The fungal laccases were screened for their ability to
   decolorize eight synthetic dyes (anthraquinone, azo, indigo and
   triarylmethane). The decolorization rate depended both on the source of
   the enzyme preparation and on the structure of the dye. Based on laccase
   production and dye decolorizing ability, T. modesta was selected for
   further studies. All the tested dyes were decolorized by the T. modesta
   laccase most efficiently under acid conditions (pH 3-6) but the optimum
   pH for decolorization of the individual dye varied. The decolorization
   rate of this laccase increased with the rise in temperature to
   50-60degreesC. The decolorization efficiency of T. modesta laccase was
   improved remarkably in the presence of mediators like
   1-hydroxybenzotriazole and 2-methoxyphenothiazine. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Sediment cores (0-35 cm below surface) from twelve sampling stations in
   the Mai Po and Inner Deep Bay Ramsar Site of Hong Kong were retrieved in
   the period March-December 1999. Vertical profiles of 15 priority
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in each sediment core were
   determined. Ranges of total PAH concentration, {[}SigmaPAH], in the
   wetland sediment were 0.18-0.83 ((x) over bar = 0.36) mug/g dried
   sediment (mudflats) and 0.63-0.96 ((x) over bar = 0.77) mug/g dried
   sediment (mangroves). A decreasing trend in depth averaged {[}SigmaPAH]
   was observed from the landward end towards the seaward end of the
   Marshes. On the mudflats, vertical profiles of the PAHs were quite
   uniform. At the fringe of the Mai Po mangroves, significantly higher
   concentration of all PAHs was observed at the upper 0 to -8cm layer. No
   significant difference in the distribution patterns of the 15 priority
   PAHs in summer and winter was observed. This indicates that distribution
   of PAHs in the sediment of the Mai Po Marshes is not very sensitive to
   sub-tropical climatic changes of the region. Two PAH isomer ratios,
   {[}Phen]/({[}Phen] + {[}Anthra]) and {[}Pyrene]/({[}Pyrene] +
   {[}Fluoran]). were used to identify potential sources of PAH
   contamination in the wetland. Results revealed that local deposition is
   a more important source than long-range atmospheric transportation. (C)

Abstract = {{Bacterial regrowth was investigated over a 15-month period in
   distribution systems (DSs) of Durham and Raleigh in North Carolina.
   These two water utilities were chosen because they are adjacent to one
   another, have similar service area characteristics, and treat surface
   waters of similar characteristics with conventional processes
   (coagulation-sedimentation and dual-media filtration). The finished
   waters have similar chemical quality and regrowth potential as measured
   by assimilable organic carbon (AOC). The major difference in treatment
   is the choice of final disinfectants (chlorine in Durham and chloramine
   in Raleigh). Ten sampling sites (monthly sampling) were chosen in each
   system to give wide geographic coverage and correspondingly, a wide
   range of water residence times. Significant losses were observed in both
   chlorine and chloramine residual in the DSs that produced bacterial
   regrowth as measured by heterotrophic plate count (HPC). The frequency
   distributions for log HPC (133 observations from Durham and 135
   observations from Raleigh) were statistically the same in the
   chlorinated and chloraminated DSs, A correlation analysis indicated that
   disinfectant residual is the most important factor determining HPC
   level. However, the resulting R-2 value for a non-linear regression
   model that also included AOC, temperature, and pH as independent
   variables was less than 0.7. Bacterial regrowth as measured by HPC, is
   dependent upon a complex interaction of chemical, physical, and
   operational parameters that may not be captured by such a simple
   statistical relationship. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Colloidal-sized particles (1 -1000 nm) and high molecular mass material
   play an important, yet poorly understood role in the aqueous speciation
   of P. This study assessed the size distribution of P in 0.45-mum
   filtered soil solutions and soil-water extracts from three sandy soils
   (grassland, arable field and forest) using gel filtration chromatography
   (GFC) and membrane filtration (0.22- and 0.025-mum pore-size) and
   evaluated the impact of P speciation on colorimetric and
   ion-chromatographic methods for orthophosphate analysis. Between 40\%
   and 58\% of molybdate reactive P (MRP) and > 85\% of molybdate
   unreactive P in the soil solution from the agricultural soils (pH
   5.9-6.3) were associated with high molecular mass material (apparent
   size > 0.025 mum, or > 600 kDa on Superdex). In solutions from the
   forest soil (pH 3.2), high molecular mass P (HMMP) compounds were of
   minor importance (<8\% of TP). The GFC elution profiles, composition and
   spectral characteristics of HMMP-containing solutions as well as the
   small relevance of HMMP at low pH were all indicative for associations
   between humic substances, Fe and/or Al, and P. Both MRP and ion
   chromatographic P measurements overestimated the free orthophosphate
   concentration (up to 2.3- and 1.4-fold, respectively) in 0.45-mum
   filtered HMMP-containing solutions. In 0.025- mum filtrates, free
   orthophosphate was the only MRP species present. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An ATP luminescence method was used to determine the toxicity of three
   reference toxicants to two sources of domestic activated sludge. and an
   activated sludge from a laboratory model plant. Repeatability in the ATP
   test was demonstrated for Cr (as K2Cr2O7), Zn (as ZnSO4.7H(2)O), and
   3,5-dichlorophenol (3,5-DCP) using each source of activated sludge, The
   three sources of sludge showed sensitivity to Cr and 3,5-DCP, and
   insensitivity to Zn using the ATP luminescence method. Sludge source did
   not appear to effect test response. The toxic response to 3,5-DCP in
   model and domestic activated sludge was shown to be dependent on sludge
   solid concentration (measured as total suspended solids, g TSS 1(-1)).
   It is recommended that a standard solids concentration is used during

Abstract = {{The roles of aluminium and ferric sulphates as destabilising agents for
   oil-water emulsions that have been stabilised by a non-ionic surfactant
   (Span 20) are investigated in terms of oil removal. The effects of
   coagulant dose, pH, and the duration and intensity of both slow and fast
   mixing are considered. Electrokinetic measurements indicate that oil
   droplets have a negative zeta potential that is weakly dependent on pH.
   The chosen coagulants are shown to be effective in reducing the zeta
   potential of the oil droplets, and charge reversal was observed for
   aluminium sulphate. Oil removals up to 99.3\% at pH 8 and 99.94\% at pH
   7 are seen for aluminium sulphate and ferric sulphate respectively.
   Rapid mixing times of around 120s and flocculation times ranging from 15
   to 20 min appear to be optimal for the DAF separation. It is concluded
   that relatively low average mixing speeds for coagulation and
   flocculation are essential for efficient operation. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study, an oxidation model combining the mass transfer of ozone
   and ozonation kinetics was developed to predict the degradation of
   several phenolic and indolic compounds in a semi-batch reactor. The mass
   transfer and partition coefficients were calculated at various physical
   and chemical conditions. In addition, the reaction rate constants of
   ozone with phenolic and indolic compounds were also estimated
   independently using the method of competition kinetics and relative
   reaction-rate constants. Incorporating mass transfer and chemical
   reaction concepts, an oxidation model that considers side reactions
   between ozone and byproducts has been established using non-linear
   simultaneous differential equations. Thus, numerical computation is
   capable of simulating the degradation of phenolic and indolic compounds
   both in synthetic and real manure. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the sorption performance of novel materials for the
   removal of lead(II) and copper(II) from near-neutral aqueous solutions.
   Active carbons with surface heteroatoms of oxygen and phosphorus have
   been prepared. The surface functional groups display weakly acidic ion
   exchange characteristics. The optimum solution pH for maximum metal
   sorption is related to the pK values of the surface functional groups.
   In oxygenated active carbons, pK values are not distinct but can be
   obtained by describing proton binding to the heterogeneous adsorbent
   surface as a continuous proton affinity distribution. Information
   derived from zeta-potential measurements combined with knowledge of the
   pK distribution function and concentration of surface functional groups
   has been used to explain the selectivity of oxidised active carbons
   towards lead(II) in the presence of copper(II) from multi-metal bearing
   solutions. Marine algal-based biosorbents have been challenged with
   lead(II) and copper(Il)-bearing wastewater. The weakly acidic carboxyl
   groups of structural polysaccharides present within the algal matrix
   display high sorption capacity for both metals. The negative surface
   charge of algal particles results in electrostatic interactions as well
   as coordination between metal species and the adsorbent surface. Proton
   affinity for the algal surface lowers the negative surface potential at
   pH values around 2. The surface functional groups in algae unlike those
   in oxidised active carbons may be represented by discrete
   acid-dissociation constant values. The influence of conformational
   differences in uronic-acid segments upon metal ion selectivity is
   discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Remediation of aquifers containing trichloroethylene (TCE) relies
   primarily on physical extraction of contaminated groundwater and soil.
   Unfortunately, this is typically expensive and does not always attain
   the desired treatment goals. In situ bioremediation via natural
   attenuation is an alternative treatment process in which TCE is
   transformed by indigenous microorganisms and plants. In this study, TCE
   was observed in a surficial aquifer that discharges into a wetland.
   Experiments were undertaken to determine whether natural attenuation of
   TCE in the wetland was possible. Microcosms were constructed using sandy
   soil+/-eastern cottonwoods (Populus deltoides) from the wetland's edge
   and organic soil+/-broad-leaved cattails (Typha latifolia) from the
   wetland's interior. {[}C-14] TCE was added to each microcosm (1.27
   muCi). Overtime, C-14 was recovered from four microcosm compartments:
   (1) as C-14 bound to soil and water, (2) as volatilized {[}C-14] TCE,
   (3) as {[}C-14] CO2 produced by mineralization of {[}C-14] TCE, and (4)
   as C-14 incorporated into the plants. Total recoveries of the C-14-label
   ranged from 73.6\% to 95.8\%. Volatilized {[}C-14] TCE accounted for the
   majority ( > 50\%) of the recovered label. In microcosms without plants,
   {[}C-14] CO2 represented 3.2\% (organic soil) to 15.6\% (sandy soil) of
   the recovered 14C, indicating that TCE was mineralized by indigenous
   microorganisms. The presence of the broad-leaved cattail resulted in
   increased production of {[}C-14] CO2 to 5.3\% in the organic soil. The
   data thus suggest that natural attenuation is a potential bioremediative
   strategy for TCE-contaminated wetlands. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of long-term stagnation on copper corrosion by-product
   release and corrosion rates was studied in piperigs according to the
   German standard DIN 5093 1, Part 1. The analysis of the water phase was
   supplemented by surface analysis of corrosion scales. Copper
   concentration during stagnation did not follow a solubility process. The
   characteristic curves obtained can be explained by subsequent copper
   release and copper refixation processes. Oxygen consumption can be
   described by the first-order kinetic rate law. The corrosion scales
   consisted of cuprite (Cu2O) and malachite (CuCO3 . Cu(OH)(2))- Malachite
   grew in well-defined crystals during stagnation, served as sink for
   dissolved copper and did not protect the pipe against corrosion attack.
   Copper concentrations measured after long-term stagnation (up to 122 h)
   correspond to the solubility of malachite in the testwater. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Monitoring programs for urban runoff have not been assessed for
   effectiveness or efficiency in estimating mass emissions. In order to
   determine appropriate designs for stormwater, total suspended solids
   (TSS) and flow information from the Santa Ana River was collected nearly
   every I min for every storm of the 1998 water year. All samples were
   used to calculate the ``true load{''} and then three within-storm
   sampling designs (flow-interval, time-interval, and simple random) and
   five among-storm sampling designs (stratified by size, stratified by
   season, simple random, simple random of medium and large storms. and the
   first in storms of the season) were simulated. Using these designs, we
   evaluated three estimators for storm massemissions (mean,
   volume-weighted, and ratio) and three estimators for annual mass
   emissions (median, ratio, and regular). Designs and estimators were
   evaluated with respect to accuracy and precision. The optimal strategy
   was used to determine the appropriate number of storms to sample
   annually based upon confidence interval width for estimates of annual
   mass emissions and concentration. The amount of detectable trend in mass
   emissions and concentration was determined for sample sizes 3 and 7.
   Single storms were most efficiently characterized (small bias and
   standard error) by taking 12 samples following a flow-interval schedule
   and using a volume-weighted estimator of mass emissions. The ratio
   estimator, when coupled with the simple random sample of medium and
   large storms within a season, most accurately estimated concentration
   and mass emissions and had low bias over all of the designs. Sampling
   seven storms is the most efficient method for attaining small confidence
   interval (C) width for annual concentration. Sampling three storms per
   Near allows a 201 0 trend to be detected in mass emissions or
   concentration over five years. These results are decreased by 1010 by
   sampling seven storms per year. ( 2002 EElsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An investigation was made of the effects of variation of the hydraulic
   retention time (HRT) and the concentrations of three different carbon
   sources (succinic acid, ethanol and acetic acid) on the denitrification
   activity of immobilized Pseudomonas butanovora cells. The highest
   denitrification activity was in all cases measured at a C: N ratio of 6:
   1 and a relatively low HRT (2.5 h). The highest denitrification rates
   were 1.17 kg NO3- -N m(-3) d(-1) for succinic acid, 1.63 kg NO3--N m(-3)
   d(-1) for ethanol and 1.53 kg NO3--N m(-3) d(-1) for acetic acid. At the
   same C: N ratios, ethanol and acetic acid proved to be better substrates
   for the reduction of nitrate and nitrite. The determined optimum C: N
   ratios were 1.78 +/- 0.31, 0.95 +/- 0.17, 1.76 +/- 0.42 for succinic
   acid, ethanol and acetic acid, respectively. The optimum C: N ratios for
   the different substrates did not change in response to an increased flow
   rate. At a C: N ratio of 3: 1 and a HRT of 1.5 h, the immobilized cells
   did not retain their activity. Apart from the difference in the
   effectivity between the electron donors, the main influence on the
   denitrification rate was exerted by the flow rate The results of this
   study demonstrated that Pseudomonas butanovora can utilize all three of
   these carbon sources to achieve a high rate of denitrification. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The acid-precipitated (AP) and acid-soluble (AS) fractions of the
   combined hydrophobic neutral and hydrophobic acid dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) were isolated from leachate collected from three municipal

   combined hydrophobic neutral and hydrophobic acid DOC comprised 6-15\%
   and 51-66\%, respectively, of the leachate nonpurgable organic carbon.
   Elemental analysis, infra-red spectroscopy, C-13 CP-MAS nuclear magnetic
   resonance spectroscopy and dipolar dephasing experiments, and
   thermochemolysis gas chromatography: mass spectrometry results showed
   that the AP and AS fractions of hydrophobic neutral and hydrophobic acid
   DOC are highly aliphatic, with linear and branching moieties, and less
   oxidized than most terrestrial and aquatic humic substances. Very
   little, if any, polysaccharide Or cellulose, lignin, or cutin components
   comprise these fractions. It is hypothesized that a majority of the
   organic carbon in these fractions originates highly branched, cyclic
   aliphatic organic compounds. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Title = {{The influence of contact zone configuration on the flow structure in a

Abstract = {{The dissolved air flotation process is used in water and wastewater
   treatment. Among many parameters the fluid dynamics determine the
   capacity of the process. The contact zone is assumed to be important for
   the removal function, as it is believed to be the location for the
   aggregation of bubbles and floes. This paper presents an experimental
   study on the flow structure in a contact zone of a DAF pilot tank and
   the influence of contact zone configuration. The flow structure in the
   contact zone was examined for different horizontal lengths of the zone
   and for different heights and inclinations of the shaft wall. The
   hydraulic surface loading was I I m/h over the total tank surface area
   and the recycle rate was constant at 10\% of the main flow. The examined
   hydraulic surface loading over the contact zone ranged from 40 to 98
   m/h. Water velocities in the longitudinal, central section of the tank
   were measured with an acoustical Doppler velocimeter in a grid net for
   the different contact zone configurations, giving an insight into the
   flow structure. The result showed that the flow structure in the contact
   zone was characterised by a turbulent lower region and a plug-flow
   higher region. The hydraulic surface loading, a function of the length
   of the contact zone, seemingly determined the extension of the turbulent
   region. A higher hydraulic surface loading decreased the turbulent
   region while the lower loading increased it. A hydraulic surface loading
   of 65 m/h was suggested for design. It was not possible to determine the
   turbulent intensity quantitatively due to the measurement method. The
   height and inclination of the shaft wall did not seem to have a
   significant influence on the turbulent region. However, an increased
   height of the contact zone enhanced the higher, plug flow region and a
   recommended height of 0.81 m or higher for the recommended hydraulic
   surface loading was suggested when both mixing and plug-flow are
   desired. The separation zone was characterised by a stratified flow
   structure, mainly influenced by the cross-flow velocity that is a
   function of the distance between the shaft wall top and the water
   surface. A cross-flow velocity of 37 m/h or higher resulted in a clearly
   defined stratification, believed to be crucial for an efficient
   separation of floes. Finally, the extension of the lower, denser
   plug-flow region in the separation zone increased when the shaft wall
   height increased. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Details are given herein, of the development of an equation for
   predicting the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in riverine flows,
   based on 81 sets of measured data, and obtained from 30 rivers in the
   USA. This equation relates the dispersion coefficient to the hydraulic
   and geometric parameters of the flow and has been derived using
   dimensional and regression analysis. with a high correlation coefficient
   (i.e. R-2 = 0.84). The formulation has been compared with many other
   existing empirical equations. frequently used to predict the
   longitudinal dispersion coefficient in riverine flows, with the
   comparisons based on four different statistical methods. These
   statistical comparisons have shown that the new equation appears to be
   more accurate than the other equations considered. The new dispersion
   equation was then linearly combined with a similar equation recently
   proposed by Seo and Cheong (J. Hydraul, Eng. ASCE 124 (1998) 25) and
   this combined equation was then also analysed using statistical methods.
   The existing empirical equations used to estimate the longitudinal
   dispersion coefficient and the new equations proposed in this study were
   included in the advective dispersion equation to predict the suspended
   sediment concentrations at three sites in the Humber Estuary sited along
   the northeast coast of England. The average percentage errors between
   the predicted- and measured-field data for the proposed new dispersion
   equations were less than those obtained using the previously documented
   equations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The 2-mercaptobenzimidazole loaded natural clay was prepared for the
   removal of Hg(II) from aqueous media. Adsorption of the metal ions from
   aqueous solution as a function of solution concentration. agitation
   time, pH, temperature, ionic strength, particle size of the adsorbent
   and adsorbent dose was studied. The adsorption process follows a
   pseudo-second-order kinetics. The rate constants as a function of
   initial concentration and temperature were Given. The adsorption of
   Hg(II) increased with increasing pH and reached a plateau value in the
   pH range 4.0-8.0. The removal of Hg(II) was found to be >99\% at an
   initial concentration of 50mg/l. Mercury(II) uptake was found to
   increase with ionic strength and temperature. Further, the adsorption of
   Hg(II) increased with increasing adsorbent dose and decrease with
   adsorbent particle size. Sorption data analysis was carried out using
   Langmuir and modified Langmuir isotherms for the uptake of metal ion in
   an initial concentration range of 50-1000 mg/l. The significance of the
   two linear relationships obtained by plotting the data according to the
   conventional Langmuir equation is discussed in terms of the binding
   energies of the two population sites involved which have a widely
   differing affinity for Hg(H) ions. Thermodynamic parameters such as
   changes of free energy, enthalpy, and entropy were calculated to predict
   the nature of adsorption. It was found that the values of isosteric heat
   of adsorption were varied with surface loading. The chlor-alkali
   industry wastewater samples were treated by MBI-clay to demonstrate its
   efficiency in removing Hg(II) from wastewater. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The degradation of naphthalene in soil-slurry systems was studied using
   four different organisms and two soils. Organisms with zero-order,
   first-order, and Michaelis-Menten rates were selected. The soils had
   substantially different sorption distribution coefficients. Sorption and
   desorption was evaluated in abiotic soil-slurry systems, The desorption
   process was described by a model that accounts for equilibrium.
   rate-limited and non-desorbing sites. Biodegradation parameters were
   measured in soil-extract solutions. Bioavailability assays, inoculated
   soil slurries, were conducted and both liquid- and sorbed-phase
   naphthalene concentrations were measured over time, For the less
   sorptive soil, the results could be explained by sequential desorption
   and degradation processes, For the other soil, enhanced degradation was
   clearly observed for the organisms with first-order and Michaelis-Menten
   rates, Several explanations are explored for these observations
   including direct sorbed-phase degradation and the development or
   elevated substrate concentrations at the organism sorbent interface. No
   enhancement was found for the organism with zero-order kinetics. (C)

Abstract = {{Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) inactivation of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 19659
   spores was examined at pilot-scale during periods representative of
   winter and summer temperature extremes at the Britannia Water Treatment
   Plant in Ottawa, Canada. In addition, bench-scale experiments using the
   same source water (Ottawa River, Ontario, Canada), as well as buffered
   and unbuffered laboratory waters were conducted using B. subtilis
   spores. Bench-scale inactivation of B. subtilis spores by ClO2, was
   similar to reported values for Cryptosporidium parvum (both organisms
   being more resistant to ClO2) than Giardia lamblia), suggesting the
   possibility that these spores may be used as potential indicators for
   protozoan parasites. Additionally, spore inactivation was observed to be
   influenced by pH in laboratory (distilled deionised water) water but not
   in Ottawa River water. At pilot-scale, spore inactivation was influenced
   by water temperature: a ClO2 dose of 2.5 mg/L resulted in a spore
   inactivation of approximately 2.0 log(10) and 0.5 log(10) at water
   temperatures of 23.2degreesC and 5.2degreesC, respectively. Chlorite
   concentrations remained below both the US EPA maximum contaminant level
   of 1.0 mg/L and the maximum contaminant level goal of 0.8 mg/L for up to
   2.0 log(10) B. subtilis inactivation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The effect of drinking water treatment ( ferric coagulation, floe
   blanket clarification, rapid sand filtration) on the spatial
   heterogeneity of five species of micro-organism was studied at pilot
   scale. It was found that the spatial heteroaeneity of vegetative
   bacteria (namely total coliform and heterotrophic (122degreesC: 3 d)
   bacteria) was little affected by treatment. Indeed, counts of total
   coliform bacteria within 5001 volumes of treated water were Poisson
   distributed (i.e. showed minimum variation). In contrast, treatment
   appeared to increase the spatial heterogeneity (or clustering) of both
   aerobic spores indigenous to the raw water and Bacillus subtilis var
   niger spores added to the raw water. Furthermore, B. subtilis var niger
   spores added to the raw water were detected in the treated water 25 h
   after termination of spiking to the raw water. The effect on C. parrum
   oocysts added to the raw water could not be determined because few
   oocysts broke through treatment into the treated water. Indeed oocyst
   removals of 5-6 logs were apparent. ``Species-specific{''} differences
   in the removal ratios were also demonstrated. It is concluded that
   audits for treatment processes based on single 100 ml ``spot{''} samples
   for spores will tend to over-estimate the net spore removal and hence
   underestimate the public health risk. Spatial heterogeneity of counts in
   treated water contributes to explaining why no ``ideal{''} surrogate has
   been identified for treatment plant performance. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Tastes and odours (T\&Os) are a major concern in drinking water as they
   are not efficiently removed by conventional water treatment. Ozonation
   has been effective for their destruction in some studies. However, the
   natural organic matter (NOM) in waters can affect the ozonation process
   and subsequently affect the destruction of T\&Os. Five NOM fractions
   were isolated and ozonated in synthetic waters. The fraction containing
   the more highly coloured, higher molecular weight compounds exhibited
   the highest ozone (O-3) demand, whereas the low aromatic fraction
   exhibited the lowest O-3 demand. The character of the NOM fractions
   influenced the ozonation of M I B and geosmin. The destruction of MIB
   and geosmin was significantly higher in the fraction with the highest
   colour and UV/visible absorbance at all O-3 doses. The destruction of
   the compounds in the other fractions showed the same trends. increasing
   MIB and geosmin destruction with increasing UV/visible absorbing

   results showing a competing effect between NOM concentration and NOM
   character. The O-3 reaction time was shown to be important for the
   destruction of both compounds. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A one-year monitoring of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts was
   conducted at a water purification plant. A total of 13 samples of 50 L
   river source water and 26 samples of 2000 L-filtered water, treated by
   coagulation-flocculation, sedimentation and rapid filtration, were
   tested. Prior to conducting a survey of a water purification plant, we
   developed a method for concentrating Cryptosporidium oocysts from a
   large volume of raw or filtered water using a hollow fiber
   ultrafiltration (UF) membrane, and this procedure was adapted to survey
   a water purification plant, Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in all
   of the 13 raw water samples. The geometric mean concentration was 40
   oocysts/100 L. Giardia cysts were detected in 12 of 13 raw water samples
   (92\%) and the geometric mean concentration was 17 cysts/100 L.
   Probability distributions of both Cryptosporidium oocyst and Giardia
   cyst concentration in raw water were nearly lognormal. In filtered water
   samples, Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in 9 of the 26 samples
   (35\%) with the geometric mean concentration of 1.2 oocysts/1000 L and
   Giardia cysts in 3 samples (12\%) with 0.8 cysts/1000 L. The estimated
   log(10) removal efficiency of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts
   by rapid-sand filtration was 2.47 and 2.53, respectively. Empty
   particles were removed at a higher log(10) than intact oocysts and
   cysts. The efficiency of particle removal in the rapid sand filtration
   process tends to be reduced under cold-water conditions. Close
   management is necessary in the winter when the water temperature is low.

Abstract = {{Research from different studies has been used to support three different
   theories pertaining to the role of cations in bioflocculation. These
   theories are the alginate theory, Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and
   Overbeek (DLVO) theory, and divalent cation bridging (DCB) theory. The
   objectives of this research were to examine the role of cations in
   bioflocculation to determine which theory, if any, best describes cation
   induced bioflocculation. Experiments were performed using laboratory
   scale activated sludge systems with bactopeptone as a feed. The feed was
   supplemented with either calcium, magnesium, or sodium at increasing
   concentrations. Floe properties were analyzed in each reactor during
   steady state periods. The addition of calcium or magnesium to the feed
   individually resulted in improvements in SVI, CST, SRF, cake solids and
   floe strength and each of these divalent cations produced similar
   results. The addition of sodium to the feed resulted in a deterioration
   in floe properties relative to a control reactor. Analysis of these
   results suggest that the DCB theory best explains the role of cations.
   The discrepancies between different studies were examined and are
   thought to be a result of different experimental procedures in different
   studies and in particular the use of short-term batch tests versus
   continuous flow reactor studies. In addition, the implications of DCB
   theory suggests that activated sludge systems should attempt to lower
   the ratio of monovalent to divalent cations to improve floe properties
   and treatment performance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Works in literature proposed the use of the rheological properties of

   We demonstrated in this work, on the contrary, that one could not

   of the sewage sludge samples taken from the same site but at different
   dates. A physically relevant index was proposed instead for describing
   the total network strength, which was hypothesized to correlate the
   dewatering efficiency of flocculated sludge. Based on this index, the
   network of a sludge was demonstrated to be largely destroyed after
   shearing, while the relaxation in an unbound environment or mild pouring
   over action could partially reinstall the structure. Moreover, a uniform
   shear rate field could produce network of greater strength when compared
   with that conditioned in a stirred tank. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Through batch equilibrium experiments under the conditions of
   temperature 25degreesC, pH values of 2.7, 5.3 and 6.1, the
   p-chlorophenol (4-cp) adsorption to biofilm components was investigated
   in this study. The contributions of biofilm components to 4-cp
   adsorption were discussed by comparing four adsorption systems, i.e.
   4-cp adsorbed by model suspended particulate matter (kaolin) with
   biofilm coating, bacteria, bacterial exopolysaccharide (EPS) and kaolin,
   respectively. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm equations were used to
   evaluate the experiment data. All the four adsorptions fitted for the
   two equations. Equilibrium isotherms were obtained for 4-cp adsorption
   on different adsorbents. The kinetic characteristics of 4-cp adsorption
   by biofilm components and the effect of pH on the kinetic process were
   investigated. The time to reach the highest adsorption amount and near
   equilibrium state in the four systems was different. The 4-cp adsorption
   by kaolin with biofilm coating reached near equilibrium at 60 min at pH
   6.1. The 4-cp adsorption by EPS and kaolin reached near equilibrium at
   150 and 180 min, respectively. But the 4-cp adsorption by bacteria
   showed no evident near equilibrium during 3 h in the experiment. The
   impact of pH value on the adsorption was also examined. The adsorption
   amount slightly increased with increasing pH from 2.7 to 6.1 for the
   adsorption systems of bacterial EPS and kaolin, but it slightly
   decreased in the systems of kaolin with biofilm coating and bacteria.

Abstract = {{A three-stage continuous culture system was used to segregate the
   component microbial groups of a methanogenic hexanoate-degrading
   association enriched from anaerobic refuse. The inhibitory effects of
   o-cresol concentrations (2-20 mM) on the fermentative, acetogenic,
   sulphate-reducing and methanogenic bacteria were then assessed in the
   presence of either 1.4 or 3.5 mM sulphate in the influent medium. The
   sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in the 1.4 mM sulphate-supplemented
   systems were the most sensitive to o-cresol, with 29.3 and 56.6\%
   inhibition on supplementation with 4 and 6 mM o-cresol, respectively.
   With 3.5 mM supplementation, inhibition was 4.5 and 19.4\%,
   respectively. Methanogenesis was not inhibited by concentrations <10 mM
   o-cresol, and complete inhibition was recorded only at concentrations >=
   10 mM. Both fermentation and acetogenesis were affected by inhibition of
   the electron sinks. The increase in influent sulphate concentration
   promoted electron flow to sulphidogenesis, as predicted on thermodynamic
   criteria, but did not affect the relative sensitivity of the different
   physiological groups. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Plant carbohydrate limitation on nitrate reduction in wetland microcosms}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{577-584}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Although nitrate limitation in most natural wetlands results in
   pseudo-first-order reductions, large site-to-site variations in apparent
   denitrification rates cannot be easily explained by water quality (e.g.,
   pH, Temp, DOC) or plant productivity. Our microcosm results show
   increasing nitrate removal efficiencies at higher ratios of total
   applied plant carbon to nitrate reduced, suggesting that denitrification
   rates may be limited by the rates of supply of both electron donor or
   acceptor, described by an applied carbon to nitrate (C-App: N-Red)
   ratio. However, the observed first-order rate constants varied more
   strongly (r(2) = 0.77, p <0.000l) with the acid-soluble carbohydrates to
   nitrate (CH2OApp: N-Red) ratio than the total C-App: N-Red ratio.
   Although observed rate constants for bulrush (Scirpus sp.) were
   significantly lower (0.01 < p < 0.06) than for other plant sources
   (Hydrocotyle sp.. Lemna sp., Typha sp.), there were no significant
   differences in the plant-specific rate constants when compared at the
   same CH2OApp: N-Red ratio. In full-scale wetlands, this suggests that
   either high plant productivity or low NO3- loading (high CH2OApp: N-Red)
   may contribute to a high effective denitrification rate. In contrast,
   low productivity or a high NO3- loading (low CH2OApp: N-Red) would
   promote a lower denitrification rate. This co-limitation between plant
   carbon and nitrate may confound first-order rate comparisons in full
   scale denitrification wetlands since highly N-loaded systems may become
   carbon limited, requiring higher order reaction kinetics to better
   describe performance variations. In addition to hydraulic residence
   time, temperature and nitrate removal data, extending these results to
   compare large wetlands will require estimation of the CH2OApp: N-Red
   ratio from an inventory of plant species, productivity estimates and
   carbon quality. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electrokinetic phenomenon is an important factor in pressure-driven
   membrane water filtration process. Zeta potential is a measurable and
   reliable parameter to characterize the charge property of membranes.
   This study investigated the effects of solution physico-chemistry on the
   zeta potential of nanofiltration membranes. A comprehensive
   semi-empirical mathematical model based on the Poisson-Boltzmann
   equation. Membrane Surface Charge model, was established. The
   correlations between the zeta potential, surface charge density and
   solution chemistry were well delineated by this new model. The empirical
   coefficients in the model are dependent on neither solution pH nor the
   ionic strength. They only reflect the characteristics of the
   electrokinetic property of the membrane-solution interface. The point of
   zero charge (PZC) can be calculated by combination of those empirical
   coefficients.
   The Membrane Surface Charge model also provides more information on
   understanding the charge interaction involved in membrane filtration
   system. The effects of potential determining ions, indifferent ions and
   specific adsorption of substances onto the membrane could be revealed by
   analyzing the coefficients of the model. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{This study deals with the adsorption of four chlorinated pollutants onto
   GAC (F-400) two pesticides (lindane and alachlor) and two PCB congeners:
   2-PCB (MPCB) and 2,2',5,5'-PCB (TPCB). Equilibrium and kinetic
   parameters have been obtained for the adsorption of alachlor and each
   PCB, whereas the kinetic results for lindane presented elsewhere (Proc.
   First World Water Congr. Int. Water Assoc., Texts of Posters, CD-ROM,
   AGHTM, Paris, 2000) are reanalyzed in this work. A model assuming a
   bidisperse structure (macro- and micropores), each region having a
   different adsorption isotherm, is used to study the adsorption kinetics
   in a batch system in the period dominated by macropore diffusion. Both
   the saturation capacity and the rate of internal transport of TPCB are
   much lower than those of the other solutes. This difference is
   attributed to a chemisorption mechanism for this compound, which is
   favored by its very low solubility. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to develop a membrane-based treatment scheme to
   remove colorants from the effluent of a baker's yeast plant. For this
   purpose microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltraton
   (NF) membranes with differing molecular weight cut-offs (MWCOs) were
   tested. To evaluate the effectiveness of membrane processes in treating
   the waste stream, optical density (OD), COD, color measurements together
   with permeation fluxes were used. Effects of pretreatment methods
   (coagulation and coarse filtration) and feed composition on OD, color,
   COD were studied. In addition, gel filtration analysis was employed to
   characterize feed and permeate streams in terms of MW distribution of
   organics that are present. Maximum rejections obtained were 94\%, 89\%
   and 72\% for OD, color and COD, respectively, when 0.8 pm
   microfiltration membrane and 400 Da NF membrane were used in series. It
   was also observed that addition of intermediate UF steps did not
   increase overall rejections and final permeate flux of NF membrane.
   Based on these observations, an efficient scheme was offered. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Characterization of total chemical oxygen demand (COD) in wastewater is
   critical for accurate modeling of constituent biotransformation steps.
   We evaluated the accuracy and precision of a commonly used soluble COD
   determination technique (coagulation using ZnSO4 at pH 10.5) in relation
   to three other physical-chemical separation techniques: destabilization
   with a non-hydrolyzing trivalent cation (LaCl3), sequential filtration,
   and ultracentrifugation. Samples of deionized water and domestic
   wastewater were spiked with aliquots of synthetic soluble COD and
   recoveries using the different separation methods were compared.
   Although mechanisms of coagulation using LaCl3 and ZnSO4 are different,
   the mean COD recoveries using these methods were in close agreement.
   Further, sorption of soluble COD onto zinc hydroxide precipitate floes
   appeared to be negligible. The two coagulation methods yielded
   statistically different (p = 0.05) soluble COD values when applied to
   nine independent wastewater samples (obtained on nine different days),
   but the difference was less than 10\%. The COD quantified by the
   coagulation techniques corresponded most closely with the <1000 Da
   molecular weight fraction defined as ``truly soluble COD{''}.
   Centrifugation of wastewater samples amended with mercuric chloride
   (HgCl2,) at 10 mg/L overestimated the soluble COD concentration. Our
   results confirm that coagulation using either ZnSO4 or LaCl3 is
   appropriate for the rapid determination of soluble COD fraction in
   wastewater matrices. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A low cost ferruginous manganese ore (FMO) has been studied for the
   removal of arsenic from groundwater. The major mineral phases present in
   the FMO are pyrolusite and goethite. The studied FMO can adsorb both
   AS(III) and As(V) without any pre-treatment, adsorption of As(III) being
   stronger than that of As(V). Both As(III) and As(V) are adsorbed by the
   FMO in the pH range of 2-8. Once adsorbed, arsenic does not get desorbed
   even on varying the pH in the range of 2-8. Presence of bivalent
   cations, namely, Ni2+, Co2+, Mg2+ enhances the adsorption capability of
   the FMO. The FMO has been successfully used for the removal of arsenic
   from six real groundwater samples containing arsenic in the range of
   0.04-0.18 ppm. Arsenic removals are almost 100\% in all the cases. The
   cost of the FMO is about 50-56 US\$ per metric tonne. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Title = {{A method for treating wastewater containing formaldehyde}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Many industrial activities utilise formaldehyde as a key chemical in
   organic synthesis including: synthesis of special chemicals such as
   pentaerythritol and ethylene glycol, synthetic resins, paper products,
   medicinal products and drugs and others, too numerous to mention.
   Therefore, effluents arising from these applications may contain
   significant amounts of formaldehyde. In a biodegradation experiments of
   a wastewater sample containing formaldehyde ranging from 31.5 to 125
   mg/l, residual formalin (a solution of formaldehyde gas in water)
   ranging from 40\% to 85\%, respectively, was found at the end of the run
   (16 d) showing the inhibition effect of formalin which increased with
   the increase in formalin concentration. The biodegradation of formalin
   decreased significantly at concentrations higher than 300 mg/l. A method
   to convert formaldehyde to an easily biodegradable substance is herein
   described. In the commercial manufacture of resins from phenol and
   formalin the reaction is never completely quantitative. As a result
   during the dehydration stage phenol and formalin are distilled from the
   wastewater. Phenol is toxic to several biochemical reactions. However,
   biological transformation of phenol to a non-toxic entity is possible
   through specialized microbes. Transformation of phenol is inhibited by
   the presence of formaldehyde. Biotransformation of phenol in a
   wastewater containing high concentrations of formaldehyde started
   shortly after treating the wastewater with calculated amounts of sodium
   sulphite. Sodium sulphite is believed to react with formaldehyde forming
   sodium formaldehyde bisulphite, which is not only non-toxic to
   microorganisms but also a biodegradable substance. From the DO
   measurements before and after the addition of sodium sulphite, the
   authors noticed that the dissolved oxygen in a wastewater containing
   formaldehyde is not affected by the addition of the calculated amount of
   sodium sulphite, which is just enough to consume the measured amount of
   formaldehyde in that wastewater. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{The stabilities of the bacterial community structures supported by seven
   full-scale biological reactors treating pharmaceutical wastewater were
   investigated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments.
   Effluent quality from this treatment process was consistently high with
   respect to BOD5 (<30 mg l(-1)), soluble COD (< 500 mg l(-1)). and total
   ammonia (<5 mg l(-1) as N) concentrations. Long-term community structure
   stability was studied by comparing the similarity of PCR-DGGE
   fingerprints from samples collected 87 days apart between which the
   influent wastewater characteristics were relatively stable. The Dice
   index (C-s) of similarity was moderately high for the first four
   reactors (C-s = 0.61-0.77) and very high for the last three reactors
   (C-s = 0.89-0.91). Short-term community structure stability was studied
   by comparing PCR-DGGE fingerprints from samples collected 15 days apart
   between which the influent wastewater characteristics changed
   significantly, while the effluent quality remained consistently high,
   The bacterial community composition of each of the seven bioreactors
   showed a moderate community shift (C-s = 0.70-0.76). Short-term
   variability in influent wastewater composition, therefore, affected a

Abstract = {{The adsorption isotherm of p-nitrophenol onto granular activated carbon
   in 25degreesC aqueous solution was experimentally determined by batch
   tests. Both the Freundlich and the Redlich-Peterson models were found to
   fit the adsorption isotherm data well. A series of column tests were
   performed to determine the breakthrough curves with varying bed depths
   (3-6 cm) and water flow rates (21.6-86.4 cm(3)/h). Explicit equations
   for the breakthrough curves of the fixed-bed adsorption processes with
   the Langmuir and the Freundlich adsorption isotherms were developed by
   the constant-pattern wave approach using a constant driving force model
   in the liquid phase. The results show that the half breakthrough time
   increases proportionally with increasing bed depth but decreases inverse
   proportionally with increasing water flow rate. The constant-pattern
   wave approach using the Freundlich isotherm model fits the experimental
   breakthrough curves quite satisfactorily. A correlation was proposed to
   predict the volumetric mass-transfer coefficient in the liquid phase
   successfully. The effects of solution temperature and pH on the
   adsorption isotherm were also studied and the Toth model was found to
   fit the isotherm data well at varying solution temperatures and pHs. (C)

Abstract = {{The ultimate disposal of excess sludge generated from activated sludge
   processes has been one of the most challenging problems for wastewater
   treatment utilities. Previous work has shown that excess sludge can be
   minimized successfully by using sludge ozonation to dissolve it into
   substrates to be oxidized in the aeration tank, However, this approach
   is a costly option. Therefore, as an alternative solution, we propose to
   use chlorination to replace ozonation in excess sludge minimization in
   the light of operational cost. To investigate the feasibility of this
   low cost approach, this paper mainly focuses on the effect of
   chlorination on sludge reduction rate, formation of trihalomethanes,
   sludge settleability, and effluent quality. Two identical activated
   sludge membrane bioreactors were continuously operated with synthetic
   wastewater under the same operation conditions for several months.
   During this period, one pilot unit was used as the reference system
   without chlorination of excess sludge, while another served as a testing
   unit, where excess sludge was taken out for conducting chlorination at a
   dose of 133 mg/g MLSS every day and the chlorinated liquor was then
   returned to the aeration tank. The sludge production rate and the water
   quality of both the units were analyzed daily. It was observed that the
   sludge production could readily be reduced by 65\% once the chlorination
   treatment was involved. However, the chlorination treatment also
   resulted in poor sludge settleability as well as significant increase of
   soluble chemical oxygen demand in the effluent, which creates potential
   difficulties in the operation of a conventional treatment plant with
   gravity clarifiers. However, it has been demonstrated that by
   integrating the immersed membrane into the activated sludge process
   these difficulties can be overcome effectively. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The application of simultaneous adsorption and biodegradation processes
   in the same reactor is known to be effective in the removal of both
   biodegradable and non-biodegradable contaminants in various kinds of
   wastewater. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of
   the two processes under sequencing batch reactor (SBR) operation in
   treating copper and cadmium-containing synthetic wastewater with
   powdered activated carbon (PAC) as the adsorbent. The SBR systems were
   operated with FILL, REACT, SETTLE, DRAW and IDLE periods in the ratio of
   0.5: 3.5:1.0:0.75:0.25 for a cycle time of 6 h. In the presence of 10
   mg/L Cu(II) and 30 mg/L Cd(II), respectively, the average COD removal
   efficiencies were above 85\% with the PAC dosage in the influent
   solution at 143 mg/L compared to around 60\% without PAC addition.
   Copper(II) was found to exert a more pronounced inhibitory effect on the
   bioactivity of the microorganisms compared to Cd(II). It was observed
   that the combined presence of Cu(II) and Cd(II) did not exert
   synergistic effects on the microorganisms. Kinetic study conducted for
   the REACT period showed that the addition of PAC had minimized the
   inhibitory effect of the heavy metals on the bioactivity of
   microorganisms. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   distribution can be fitted with a gamma function, (ii) it steady-state
   mean floc size is reached for a given stirring rate, (iii) this stable
   floc size is shifted towards floc growth its sludge concentration is
   increased, (iv) under cycled-shear conditions, microbial aggregates
   break up and re-form in an almost reversible manner. (v) blending of raw
   sludge and sludge spiked with Aquatal mineral particles results in
   particle exchange between flocs and (vi) the detailed study of exchange
   kinetics indicates that some flocs do not participate to the aggregation
   dynamics. These experimental results suggest that the activated sludge
   floc size is governed by a flocculation deflocculation balance, implying
   an exchange of floc constituents between microbial aggregates. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The phosphorus content of fluvial sediment (suspended sediment and the
   <63 \&mu;m fraction of floodplain and channel bed sediment) has been
   examined in contrasting rural (moorland and agricultural) and
   industrialized catchments in Yorkshire, UK. The River Swale drains a
   rural catchment with no major urban and industrial areas, and the total
   phosphorus (TP) content of fluvial sediment is generally within the
   range 500-1500 \&mu;g g(-1). There is little evidence of any major
   downstream increase in TP content. In contrast, fluvial sediment from
   the industrialized catchments of the Rivers Aire and Calder exhibits
   both higher levels of TP content and marked downstream increases, with
   values of TP content ranging from <2000 mug g(-1) in headwater areas
   upstream of the main urban and industrial areas, to values >7000 mug
   g(-1) at downstream sites. These elevated levels reflect P inputs from
   point sources, such as sewage treatment works (STWs) and combined sewer
   overflows. The influence of STWs is further demonstrated by the
   downstream increase in the inorganic P/organic P ratio from <2 in the
   headwaters to >4 in the lower reaches. Comparison of the P content of
   suspended sediment with that of the <63 \&mu;m fraction of potential
   source materials suggests that topsoil from upland moorland/pasture and
   from cultivated areas, and channel bank material are likely to be the
   main sources of particulate P (PP) in the River Swale and in the
   headwaters of the Rivers Aire and Calder. In the middle and lower
   reaches of the Rivers Aire and Calder, inputs associated with urban and
   industrial land uses, such as STWs, industrial effluents and street
   dust, are likely to represent the dominant sources of PP. During high
   flow events, such urban inputs may be diluted by inputs from moorland
   and agricultural land in the headwaters. Consequently, for all three
   rivers, there are inverse relationships between the TP content of
   suspended sediment and both discharge and suspended sediment
   concentration, reflecting changes in sediment and P sources during high
   flow events. Spatial variations in the P contents of the <63 mum
   fraction of overbank floodplain deposits and channel bed sediment
   evidence a similar pattern as those for suspended sediment, with
   relatively low levels of TP in the River Swale and elevated levels in
   the middle and downstream reaches of the Rivers Aire and Calder. The PP
   concentrations associated with floodplain and channel bed sediment are,
   however, lower than equivalent values for suspended sediment, and this
   primarily reflects the differences in the particle size composition
   between the three types of sediments. Rates of floodplain deposition and
   the amounts of fine-grained sediment stored in the river channels are
   relatively high, and suggest that such environments may represent
   important sinks for PP. Based on the sediment samples collected from the
   study basins, a simple four-fold classification which relates the TP
   content of suspended sediment to upstream land use has been established.
   Both the range and the absolute values of TP content tend to increase
   with an increase in the level of urbanization and industrialization. (C)

Abstract = {{Aerobic granular sludge was cultivated in an intensely mixed sequencing
   batch airlift reactor (SBAR). A COD loading of 2.5 kg Acetate-COD/(m(3)
   d) was applied. Granules developed in the reactor within one week after
   inoculation with suspended activated sludge from a conventional
   wastewater treatment plant, Selection of the dense granules from the
   biomass mixture occurs because of the differences in settling velocities
   between granules (fast settling biomass), and filaments and floes (slow
   settling biomass). At `steady state' the granules had an average
   diameter of 2.5 mm, a biomass density of 60g VSS/1 of granules, and a
   settling rate of >10 m/h. The biomass consisted of both heterotrophic
   and nitrifying bacteria. The reactor was operated over a long period
   during which the granular sludge proved to remain stable. The
   performance of the intermittently fed SBAR was compared to that of the
   continuously fed biofilm airlift suspension reactor (BASR). The most
   importance difference was that the density of the granules in the SBAR
   was much higher than the density of the biofilms in the BASR. It is
   discussed that this could be due to the fact that the SBAR is
   intermittently fed, while the BASR is continuously fed. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{We investigated and compared the impact of organic loads due to the
   biodeposition of mussel and fish farms on the water column of a coastal
   area of the Tyrrhenian Sea (Western Mediterranean). Physico-chemical
   data (including oxygen, nutrients, DOC and particulate organic matter),
   microbial variables (picoplankton and picophytoplankton density and
   biomass) and phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll-a) were determined on
   a monthly basis from March 1997 to February 1998. The results of this
   study indicate that both fish farm and mussel culture did not alter
   significantly dissolved inorganic phosphorus and chlorophyll-a values,
   while inorganic nitrogen concentrations were higher in mussel farm area.
   However, waters overlying the fish farm presented significantly higher
   DOC concentrations. In contrast, no significant differences were
   observed comparing particulate matter concentrations. The increased DOC
   concentrations determined a response of the heterotrophic fraction of
   picoplankton, while picophytoplankton. likewise phytoplankton, did not
   display differences among fish or mussel farms and control site. From
   the analysis of the different microbial components, it is possible to
   conclude that the impact of fish farms is evident only for the
   heterotrophic components. The comparative analysis of the mussel
   biodeposition and fish-farm impact revealed that mussel farms induced a
   considerably lower disturbance, apparently limited to an increased
   density and biomass of microbial assemblages beneath the mussel
   cultures. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Partial denitrification and the initial step of nitrification are the
   main biological processes which produce nitrous oxide. In order to
   determine the contribution that these processes have in nitrous oxide
   production, the efficiency of different inhibitors on nitrifying
   activity has been tested, and the effect on denitrifying activity has
   been investigated, using culture strains and natural marine samples. A
   good nitrification inhibitor should not affect denitrification. A low
   partial pressure Of C2H2 provided the best conditions, inhibiting 75\%.
   Nitrosococcus oceanus (culture sample) and 100\% (natural sample) of the
   nitrifying activity and having only a small inhibitory effect (12\%) oil
   denitrifying activity. These conditions have been applied on samples
   from the dilution plume of the Rhone River. an area characterized as a
   source of nitrous oxide. Using these inhibitors, it has been shown that
   in this area, incomplete denitrification is the main process producing
   nitrous oxide in the surface layers at the mouth of the river and in the
   bottom nepheloid layer, whereas in the marine surface layer the dominant
   process is nitrification. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Transport and source of metal contaminants (Ag, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) in
   the turbidity maximum zone of the Hudson River estuary were studied over
   the course of a tidal cycle in November 1994 and August 1995. This study
   showed that the metal/Fe ratios in suspended particles varied more
   widely than those in the local sediments, implying that sources of metal
   contaminants to the water column are not only from local sediment
   resuspension but also from lateral advection. Although the metal/Fe
   ratios oscillate with time at the anchor stations, a general increasing
   trend with salinity was found over the course of a tidal cycle,
   suggesting that the lower estuary could be a source of metal
   contaminants to the upper estuary regions. These results support that
   sediment resuspension and lateral advection are important factors
   responsible for transporting the lower estuary contaminants up river and
   redistributing metal contaminants in the estuary. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Ballasted flocculation is applied successfully in the water treatment
   industry, but the concept has not yet been subject to extended
   experimental studies. The use of a microsand and a polymer together to
   increase the weight of the floes and the rate at which they settle is
   radically changing the coagulation-flocculation-settling methodology.
   The objective of this research is to study ballasted flocculation in the
   laboratory by means of a modified jar-test procedure. The first tests,
   conducted using a statistical approach, enabled us to identify those
   parameters that have a significant influence on the quality of settled
   water. The principal treatment parameters considered in this study were
   the chemical dosage, the contact times in the different basins, the pH
   of coagulation and the dosage of microsand. The parameters used to
   evaluate the quality of the settled water, and hence treatment
   performances, were turbidity. UV absorbance, TOC and membrane
   filterability. The results showed that the coagulant dosage and the
   coagulation pH have a preponderant effect on the variability of the
   quality of the settled water. By contrast, filterability its Measured by
   the laboratory filter tests, was found to be more sensitive to coagulant
   and microsand dosages. It was dependent on the ratio of microsand to
   polymer dosage, and improved when this ratio increased. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Scale formation in industrial or domestic installations is still an
   important economic problem. The existence of a metastable domain for
   calcium carbonate supersaturated solutions and its breakdown are
   observed under conditions rarely well defined. In most cases it is the
   pH rise caused by the carbon dioxide loss that involves calcium
   carbonate precipitation. Before studying this problem, we suggest in
   this first part, a new model for the evolution of the calco-carbonic
   system that takes into account the hydrated forms of CaCO3: CaCO3
   amorphous, CaCO3.6H(2)O(ikaite) and CaCO3.H2O (monohydrate). According
   to this model, the precipitation of any one of these hydrated forms
   could be responsible for the breakdown of the metastable state. After
   this first step, the solids evolve into dehydrated forms.
   At first, the metastable domain spread of the calcium carbonate
   supersaturated solutions was studied by the elaboration of computer
   programs in which the formation of CaCO30(aq) ion pairs was taken into
   account. These ion pairs are supposed to evolve through dehydration to
   form the various calcium carbonate solid form precursors. This
   thermodynamic study was then compared to the experimental methods of the
   critical pH. Here the pH rise was caused by adding sodium hydroxide
   under different conditions for sodium hydroxide addition speed,
   agitation mode and ageing of solutions.
   For the highest speed of sodium hydroxide addition, the CaCO3 ionic
   product reached the value of the amorphous calcium carbonate solubility
   product, and the reaction of the amorphous calcium carbonate
   precipitation was of the homogenous type. Decreasing the reagent's
   addition speed caused an extension of the titration time. Then, the
   breakdown of the metastable state was obtained with the CaCO3.H2O
   heterogeneous precipitation. This clearly illustrates the probable
   ageing of the precursors of the solid states that are considered in this
   model. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the first part, we have designed a new model of evolution for the
   calco-carbonic system which includes the hydrated forms of CaCO3:CaCO3
   amorphous, CaCO3.6H(2)O (ikaite) and CaCO3.H2O (monohydrate) (J. Eur.
   Hydr. 30 (1999) 47). According to this model, it is the precipitation of
   one or other of these hydrated forms which could be responsible for the
   breakdown of the metastable state, After this first step, the
   precipitates evolve to dehydrated solid forms. Through the elaboration
   of computer programs in which the CaCO30 (aq) ion pair formation was
   considered, this model was compared to experimental data obtained by the
   critical pH method applied to synthetic solutions.
   In the present article, the same method was applied for four French
   mineral waters. at 25degreesC under study, Three samples formed a
   precipitation during the sodium hydroxide addition, For these three
   cases, this precipitation began for the CaCO3.H2O saturation. The added
   volume of sodium hydroxide was more than what was required for
   neutralizing free CO2 initially in solution. These results indicate that
   during a spontaneous scaling phenomenon, the pH rises at the same time
   by loss of the initial free CO2 and of the one produced by the hydrogen
   carbonate ions decomposition, Then we calculated, at various
   temperatures for the three studied scaling waters: CO2 partial pressures
   and loss of total carbon corresponding to the solubility products of
   CaCO3 hydrated forms. The results show that the partial pressure
   monitoring of the carbon dioxide is important in managing the behavior
   of scaling waters. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This note reports the results of experiments aimed at confirming the
   luxury uptake of phosphorus (P) by sediment bacteria as polyphosphate
   (Poly-P). Aerobic suspensions of sediments front two different sites
   were spiked with 1 mg P/L as orthophosphate and augmented with acetate
   (a fermentation product) or glucose. The orthophosphate was rapidly
   taken up over a period of a few hours. When these aerobic uptake
   experiments were made anaerobic and additional organic carbon added,
   only the acetate-amended sediment released a significant amount of the
   added phosphorus. It was hypothesised that during the aerobic stage, and
   with the addition of acetate. some of the phosphorus was accumulated as
   Poly-P by sediment microorganisms, which was released during the
   subsequent anaerobic stage (provided acetate was still present). Two
   lines of evidence-transmission electron microscope analysis of sediment
   bacteria and P-31-NMR analysis of sediment extracts-are presented to
   support the hypothesis that a portion of the phosphorus taken up during
   the aerobic experiments was stored as Poly-P. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Using the measures of initial reaction rate, a kinetic-photometric
   method is developed that uses the reaction of Diquat with H2O2 in basic
   medium. The reaction rate is very high and therefore the stopped-flow
   mixing technique is required in order to make kinetic measurements, The
   reaction rate is obtained in 20 s after the reactants are mixed and it
   allows the simple application of the method proposed to the routine
   analyses. The sensitivity of the method is very high being the detection
   limit 0.44 mug mL(-1) and the application range between 1 and 16 mug
   mL(-1). The time of measure per sample is 90s. The proposed
   kinetic-photometric method has been applied to the direct determination
   of this compound in river water, in the water of laundry of the olives,
   and in a commercial product. The results are very acceptable. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Nitrate flux from a bedrock aquifer due to a storm was calculated by
   hydrograph separation. The hydrograph generated by a 20-mm rain in Cedar
   River of Iowa was separated into the following three components: the
   constant baseflow, the rainwater, and the water released from aquifer in
   excess of baseflow. The separation was conducted by using oxygen
   isotopes, dissolved nitrate, and stream discharge.
   The peak discharge was 33 h long. During this period, the water released
   from the aquifer storage in excess of baseflow was 36\% of the total
   discharge. The rainwater and the pre-storm baseflow equivalents were
   17\% and 47\%, respectively, The nitrate concentrations in the
   instantaneous discharge ranged between 8.6 and 10.0 mg/L. The average
   concentrations in the rainwater and the baseflow were 3.7 and 9.8 mg/L,
   respectively. A total of 3.6 x 10(5) mol of nitrate was transported by
   the stream during the 33 h of peak discharge, Approximately 35\% (1.3 x
   10(5) mol) of this mass was derived from the aquifer storage in excess
   of baseflow contribution. The rainwater and the constant baseflow
   equivalents were 7\% (2.6 x 10(4) mol) and 58\% (2.1 x 10(5) mol).
   respectively. The release of a significant amount of nitrate from the
   aquifer suggests that the local geology is favorable for vertical
   recharge of rainwater which causes an increased fluid pressure within
   the aquifer forcing ground water to discharge laterally into the stream.
   Such observation also implies that the aquifer is effectively flushed
   out during storms. thus restricting long term build-up of nitrate from
   agricultural sources. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   under those experimental conditions (inhibition of nitrification with
   ATU), hydrogen peroxide alters neither the biomass metabolism nor the
   biodegradability of the tested substrates. The oxygen uptake rates
   obtained with the aeration system were often more scattered due to the
   adhesion of fine bubbles after the switch off of the aeration. Moreover,

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design and use of modified solution samplers
   and non-weighing lysimeters in a field experiment examining the response
   of a turf-soil system to landfill leachate irrigation over a 2-year
   period. The two designs were shown to offer significant performance
   advantages, were cost effective and overcame many of the reported
   problems commonly associated with each technique. The quantities of
   leached chloride detected in the 20\%, 50\% and undiluted leachate
   irrigated plots by the modified solution samplers (1677, 4319 and 8021
   kg ha(-1), respectively) and microlysimeters (1759, 4512 and 8160 kg
   ha(-1) respectively) were significantly higher than the conventional
   sampler design (1407, 3767 and 7052 kg ha(-1), respectively).
   Additionally, the microlysimeter design functioned reliably throughout
   the experiment, achieving solution flow rates analogous to the
   unconfined plots. Therefore. it was concluded that both the designs
   appear to be suitable for monitoring changes in soil solution
   composition associated with sub-surface wastewater irrigation. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Studies have been conducted specifically to investigate the hypothesis
   that N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) can be produced by reactions
   involving monochloramine. Experiments were conducted using dimethylamine
   (DMA) as a model precursor. NDMA was formed from the reaction between
   DMA and monochloramine indicating that it should be considered a
   potential disinfection by-product. The formation of NDMA increased with
   increased monochloramine concentration and showed maximum in yield when
   DMA was varied at fixed monochloramine concentrations. The mass spectra
   of the NDMA formed from DMA and N-15 isotope labeled monochloramine
   ((NH2Cl)-N-15) showed that the source of one of the nitrogen atoms in
   the nitroso group in NDMA was from monochloramine. Addition of 0.05 and
   0.5 mM of preformed monochloramine to a secondarily treated wastewater
   at pH 7.2 also resulted in the formation of 3.6 and 111 ng/L of NDMA,
   respectively, showing that this is indeed an environmentally relevant
   NDMA formation pathway. The proposed NDMA formation mechanism consists
   of (i) the formation of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) intermediate from
   the reaction of DMA with monochloramine followed by, (ii) the oxidation
   of UDMH by monochloramine to NDMA, and (iii) the reversible chlorine
   transfer reaction between monochloramine and DMA which is parallel to
   (i). We conclude that reactions involving monochloramine in addition to
   classical nitrosation reactions are potentially important pathways for
   NDMA formation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The potential for iron (hydr)oxides to remove dissolved hydrogen
   sulphide from seawater has been examined under flow-through conditions.
   Ferrihydrite (a hydrous iron (III) oxide) was stabilised by
   precipitation onto zeolite pellets, and rates of sulphide removal were
   determined under laboratory conditions at pH 8.5. Sulphide removal
   kinetics were dependent on the initial sulphide concentration, substrate
   mass and flow rate. The experimental data suggest that these parameters
   can be optimised to result in the rapid and effective removal of
   hydrogen sulphide. The results from laboratory experiments compared
   favourably with sulphide removal kinetics determined in a series of
   experiments performed online in a recirculating mariculture production
   system. However, the presence in solution of ligands such as phosphate
   may also significantly affect reaction rates; a 50\% reduction in
   sulphide removal rate for substrate removed from an online system was
   partly attributed to phosphate adsorption. The formation of a more
   crystalline, less reactive iron (hydr)oxide in recharged substrate was
   the likely result of FeS oxidation, which may also have contributed to
   the observed reduction in sulphide removal rates. Ferrihydrite-coated
   zeolite would appear to provide an efficient, low-cost method for
   sulphide removal, which is particularly suited to relatively small-scale
   aqueous flow-through systems. The reaction of iron (hydr)oxides with
   dissolved sulphide is also accompanied by a distinct colour change due
   to the formation of black FeS(s) which, under appropriate conditions,
   may be used as a rapid indicator of sulphidic conditions. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{In an agricultural catchment area in Germany we analyzed water samples
   from five entry routes for 2 insecticides. 5 fungicides and 13
   herbicides. The sewage plant outlet and the emergency overflow of a
   sewage sewer contained only herbicides. In each farmyard runoff we found
   on average 24 g pesticides during application period, presumably caused
   by cleaning the spraying equipment. In comparison, the field runoff and
   the rainwater sewer contained less load. but also insecticides,
   fungicides and herbicides. The sewage plant caused 65.9\% of the total
   herbicide load, the sewage sewer 19.8\% and the farmyard runoff 12.8\%.
   The farmyards also caused 83.7\% of total insecticide and 83.8\% of
   fungicide load. The total load of all entry routes is correlated with
   the amount of pesticides applied in the catchment area and the K-o/w
   value for each pesticide (mult. regress. r(2) : 0.82; p<0.0001: n = 14).
   In stream A the sewage plant caused a slight but continuous
   contamination by herbicides with 82\% of the total load found during
   low-water phase. In comparison. stream B had only farmyard runoff and
   non-point sources. which caused high peaks of herbicide and a
   contamination by insecticides. Consequently, high-water phases generated
   70\% of the total pesticide load. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A five-stage consecutive irreversible model is derived to predict the
   photodegradation of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in a surfactant solution,
   which was proven to be a useful treatment process following the
   surfactant-aided soil washing or remediation. The photodegradation of
   HCB in surfactant micelles is dominated by photodechlorination, which
   sequentially removes chlorides one at a time. The minor pathways of
   photoisomerization and photochlorination were neglected in the kinetic
   model. The results show that the derived consecutive irreversible model
   can accurately predict the decay of HCB and the formation (and decay) of
   its less-chlorinated congeners. The initial rate approach was used to
   identify the proper range of decay rate of each chlorinated benzene; so
   the overall rate constants can be determined easier by trial. The
   decreased performance of a completely mixed flow reactor (CMFR) with
   continuous input is also quantified compared to a batch reactor. (C)

Abstract = {{Raw waters polluted with trace heavy metals present serious problems to
   the part of the Chinese water supply. One of the important contaminants
   is cadmium. Removal of trace amounts of heavy metals can be achieved by
   means of selective sorption processes. One of the possibilities is the
   application of weak base anion exchangers. LEWIS-base; acid interactions
   lead to an exclusive sorption of heavy metal cations and an equivalent
   amount of anions of strong acids. The respective elimination of cadmium
   from pure solutions and spiked natural water and the regeneration of the
   exhausted exchanger has been investigated. The results demonstrate a
   very efficient elimination. The standards for drinking water are met for
   a very large relative volume of treated water. In addition, even a
   considerable share of dissolved organic matter is adsorbed. Regeneration
   requires a first step with sulfuric acid to remove the metals and a
   second one with sodium hydroxide to neutralize the exchanger and to
   displace the DOC adsorbed. The heavy metals can be concentrated in a
   small volume which facilitates the discharge of the waste. (C) 2002

Title = {{Characterization of dissolved organic matter in effluents from

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in effluents from sewage and human-wastes
   treatment plants (STPEs and HWTPEs) was fractionated using resin
   adsorbents into six classes: aquatic humic substances (AHS), hydrophobic
   bases (HoB), hydrophobic neutrals (HoN), hydrophilic acids (HiA),
   hydrophilic bases (HiB), and hydrophilic neutrals (HiN).
   DOM-fraction distribution varied substantially depending on the kind of
   wastewater and the type of treatment process. AHS and HiA dominated in
   all effluents. collectively accounting for more than 55\% of the DOM
   measured as dissolved organic carbon (DOC). In particular, HiA were the
   most abundant fraction in the effluents, constituting 32-74\% of the
   DOM. AHS appeared to be the second most dominant fraction and varied
   considerably. accounting for 3-28\% of the DOM. The HoN fraction also
   varied from 0-21\%. AHS, HoN, and HiA were the fractions that changed
   substantially and differed characteristically among the samples studied.
   The ratios of ultraviolet absorbance to DOC (UV : DOC ratio) in all
   effluents exhibited a common relationship: AHS > total DOM > HiA.
   Nevertheless, the ratios were substantially different between STPEs and
   HWTPEs and among HWTPEs. For HWTPEs, the effluent from the chemical
   coagulation process had the highest UV: DOC ratios. On the other hand,
   the effluent from the ultrafiltration and activated carbon adsorption
   processes had the lowest ratios. Molecular size distribution of the
   effluents was determined by size exclusion chromatography and found to
   exhibit a relatively narrow size range and low weight-averaged molecular
   weights ranging from 380 to 830 g mol(-1). The weight-averaged molecular
   weight of DOM increased as the UV : DOC ratio of total DOM increased.

Abstract = {{Jar tests were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of potassium
   ferrate preoxidation on algae removal by coagulation. Laboratory studies
   demonstrated that pretreatment with potassium ferrate obviously enhanced
   the algae removal by coagulation with alum {[}Al-2(SO4)(3) . 18H(2)O].
   Algae removal efficiency increased remarkably when the water was
   pretreated with ferrate. A very short time of preoxidation was enough to
   achieve substantial algae removal efficiency, and the effectiveness was
   further increased at a prolonged pretreatment time. Pretreatment with
   ferrate resulted in a reduction of alum dosage required to cause an
   efficient coagulation for algae removal. The obvious impact of cell
   architecture by potassium ferrate was found through scanning electron
   microscopy. Upon oxidation with ferrite, the cells were inactivated and
   some intracellular and extracelluar components were released into the
   water. which may be helpful to the coagulation by their bridging effect.
   Efficient removal of algae by potassium ferrite preoxidation is believed
   to be a consequence of several process mechanisms. Ferrate preoxidation
   inactivated algae. induced the formation of coagulant aid, which are the
   cellular components secreted by algal cells. The coagulation was also
   improved by increasing particle concentration in water, because of the
   formation of the intermediate forms of precipitant iron species during
   preoxidation. In addition, it was also observed that ferrite
   preoxidation caused algae agglomerate formation before the addition of
   coagulant, the subsequent application of alum resulted in further
   coagulation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was the simulation of lead solubility
   equilibria in mixtures of concrete lixiviation waters and ground waters
   in order to obtain the data necessary for the modelling of lead
   behaviour. The lixiviation water was impossible to obtain in sufficient
   quantity by compression of concrete specimens and was replaced by cement
   water prepared by mixing a CLC or CPA cement suspension in distilled
   water under argon. Three lead salts, PbCl2, PbSO4 and PbCO3, were
   studied; they correspond to the anions found most frequently in the
   ground waters. The experimental curves of lead solubility were
   determined, at 20degreesC, from pH 5 to 13, for various systems: cement
   water/lead salt/ground water. The modelling of 10 systems was carried
   out by the PHREEQC code from the solution compositions (ground water and
   cement water mixtures) and the thermodynamic constants obtained from the
   MINTEQ data base. The chemical models included the nature of the species
   in solution and the solid phases in equilibrium together with the
   corresponding values for the logarithms of the formation constants or
   solubility products. These models were validated by comparing the
   experimental pH and solubilised lead concentration values with the
   values calculated using the PHREEQC code. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper investigated the variation of assimilable organic carbon
   (AOC) concentrations in water from several typical water treatment
   plants and distribution systems in a northern city of China. It is
   concluded from this study that: (1) The AOC in most of the product water
   of the studied water treatment plants and the water from the associated
   distribution systems could not meet the biostability criteria of 50-100
   mug/L. (2) Only 4\% of the measured AOC concentrations were less than
   100 mug/L. However, about half of the measured AOC values were less than
   200 mug/L. (3) Better source water quality resulted in lower AOC
   concentrations. (4) The variation of AOC concentrations in distribution
   systems was affected by chlorine oxidation and bacterial activity: the
   former resulted in an increase of AOC value while the latter led to a
   reduction in AOC. (5) The variation of AOC concentration followed
   different patterns in different distribution systems or different
   seasons due to their respective operational characteristics. (6) Less
   than 30\% of AOC could be removed by a conventional treatment process,
   whereas 30-60\% with a maximum of 50-60\% could be removed by granular
   activated carbon (GAC). (7) The observation via scanning electron
   microscope (SEM) on distribution pipe tubercle samples demonstrated that
   the pipe inner wall was not smooth and bacteria multiplied in the
   crevice as well as in the interior wall of distribution pipes. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Adsorption tests were performed on two different exhausted oils to
   reduce their polluting and health hazard potential: a ``water-insoluble
   oil{''}, utilised for automotive engine lubrication, and an
   ``emulsified{''} oil, used as coolant for metal-cutting tools. Dolomite,
   a low-cost recovery material, was used to prepare two effective
   adsorbents: (a) a mixed Ca and Mg oxide obtained by thermal
   decomposition of dolomite at 1800degreesC. and (b) an activated material
   obtained by submitting this product to chemical treatment with HCl.
   Preliminary tests carried out with an excess of the former material
   showed that the insoluble oil was adsorbed with lower yield (Y = 0.40)
   than the soluble (emulsified) oil (Y = 0.60). The material activation
   with HCl remarkably improved the adsorption of soluble oil organic
   fraction (Y > 0.90), while only a little increase in the removal yield
   was observed for the insoluble oil (Y = 0.44). The results presented and
   discussed in this work pointed out that the products of dolomite
   calcination can successfully replace the conventional adsorbing
   materials in the removal of organic pollutants, with particular concern
   to exhausted soluble oils, which cannot usually be recycled, thus
   reducing the operational costs of their treatment. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Title = {{Organotin contamination in sediments from the Western Mediterranean
   enclosures following 10 years of TBT regulation}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Organotin (OT) compounds, namely butyl and phenyl, were measured in 38
   recent sediments collected in harbours of the Western Mediterranean Sea
   (Northern: 4 and Southern: 9) and domestic and industrial sewage
   disposal sites (Northern: 9 and Southern: 1). Butyltins were the
   predominant tin species identified as being tributyltin (TBT) widespread
   in the whole area which suggests recent inputs of OTs. The highest
   levels of TBT were detected in commercial harbours associated with
   inputs from large vessels (average value: 5.0 mug TBT g(-1)). Moreover.
   relatively high TBT values were also detected in fishing and
   recreational boating areas (average level ca. 1.0 mug TBT g(-1)).
   Phenyltin derivatives occurred at lower levels than butyltins being the
   monophenyltin the predominant compound (average values 45-945 ng g(-1)).
   The large predominance of the phenyltin degradation products (i.e. mono
   and diphenyltin) over the parent compound (i.e. triphenyltin) suggests
   that there are almost no recent inputs of these compounds. Furthermore,
   a comparative study of the OT occurrence in the sewage sludge disposal
   sites offshore Barcelona and Almeria (domestic) and into the Tarragona
   harbour (industrial) shows that domestic primary sewage sludge effluents
   can contribute to coastal OT pollution (244 ng TBT g(-1)). Nevertheless,
   sewage sludge is a secondary source of OT contamination in the coastal
   environment in comparison to commercial harbours. In a comparative study
   with previous data collected in the late 1980s, the present study
   reveals that OT regulation, established in the Mediterranean region in
   1991 on the use of TBT-based antifouling paints have been effective in
   marinas, but reveals a significant TBT contamination in commercial and
   fishing harbours. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microtox(R) is a frequent toxicity tool for the screening of wastewaters
   discharged into wastewater treatment plants. There is currently an
   increasing controversy between this test and others using activated
   sludge. A Microtox(R) and electrolytic respirometry comparative study
   for toxicity determination has been performed. Seven organic and five
   inorganic toxic compounds have been assessed for comparing both methods.
   Microtox(R) proved to have a higher sensitivity to toxicants but was
   less representative of effects on activated sludge compared to
   respirometry. For instance, assays accomplished with LAS, a
   biodegradable reference surfactant. showed a toxic effect by Microtox(R)
   but good biodegradability and no toxicity in respirometry. This could be
   explained by the different nature of the biological material used, as
   Microtox(R) utilises the seawater Vibrio fischeri, whereas respirometry
   uses the bacterial consortium in activated sludge. For the evaluation of
   the potential toxicity of a compound on a WWTP, the preferred biological
   material be used should be activated sludge itself. Results obtained
   with any other biological material would be just an approach to reality.

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this work are to (1) determine the diffusion
   coefficients of natural organic matter (NOM) by diffusivimetry, (2)
   compare the results with diffusion coefficients determined by two other
   methods (fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and dynamic
   adsorption experiments (DAM), (3) compare molecular weights derived from
   the diffusion coefficients to molecular weights determined by three
   different ultrafiltration experiments and high perfomance size exclusion
   chromatography (HPSEC). The diffusion coefficients determined in this
   work (stirred diffusion cell) are about 70\% higher than that determined
   by DAM, and agree well with diffusion coefficients determined by FCS.
   Molecular weights determined by HPSEC are of the same magnitude as
   molecular weights derived from diffusion coefficients. Molecular weights
   determined by ultrafiltration vary considerably depending on the choice
   of membrane types. Membranes made of cellulose acetate generate results
   similar to results derived from diffusion coefficients. Membranes made
   of regenerated cellulose and polyether sulfone appear to retain too much
   of NOM, resulting in artificially high molecular weights. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The stability and performance of an anaerobic baled reactor (ABR)
   treating an ice-cream wastewater at several organic loading rates have
   been investigated. Specifically, it was determined whether an ABR would
   promote phase separation and if a polymer additive was capable of
   enhancing granule formation in an ABR. In order to achieve these goals,
   two ABRs, having identical dimensions and configurations, were used to
   study the above objectives using a synthetic ice-cream wastewater. The
   ABR proved to be an efficient reactor configuration for the treatment of
   a high-strength synthetic ice-cream wastewater. An organic loading rate
   of around 15 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) was treated with a 99 io COD removal
   efficiency. From the jar test and inhibition assay, it was concluded
   that Kymene SLX-2 was the most effective and least inhibitory polymer
   tested. The methane yield was higher in the polymer-amended reactor
   compared to the control reactor. In addition, polymer addition resulted
   in a considerably higher degree of biomass retention and lower solids
   washout from the ABR. Consequently, it demonstrated that there was a
   considerable potential for sludge conditioning in ABRs by facilitating
   better biomass retention within the reactor which in turn led to better
   process performance. Granulation was achieved in both ABRs within 3
   months. However, the granules from the polymer-amended reactor appeared
   earlier and were generally larger and more compact, although this was
   not quantified in detail during the present study. The main advantage of
   using an ABR comes from its compartmentalised structure. The first
   compartment of an ABR may act as a buffer zone to all toxic and
   inhibitory material in the feed thus allowing the later compartments to
   be loaded with a relatively harmless, balanced and mostly acidified
   influent. In this respect, the latter compartments would be more likely
   to support active populations of the relatively sensitive methanogenic
   bacteria and partly explains why the best granules and the highest
   methane yield were obtained in Compartment 2. It is unlikely that a
   complete separation of phases (acidogenic and methanogenic) occurred
   within the ABRs since methane production was observed in all
   compartments, although this was low (similar to40\% of all gas
   composition) in Compartment 1, becoming higher (similar to70\%) in the
   following compartments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The microbial ecology of wastewater treatment plants remains one of the
   least understood aspects in both aerobic and anaerobic systems. despite
   the fact that both processes are ultimately dependent on an active
   biomass for operational efficiency. Ultimately, future developments in
   anaerobic treatment processes will require a much greater understanding
   of the fundamental relationships between bacterial populations within
   the biomass if optimum process efficiency is to be fully realised. This
   study assesses the influence of polymer addition on granule formation
   within an ABR and compares the ecology of the biomass in each
   compartment of two ABRs treating ice-cream wastewater. To our knowledge.
   this is the first reported characterisation of the microbiology of
   acidogenic and methanogenic bacteria in the individual compartments of
   an ABR. The polymer-amended reactor contained sludge that had a greater
   density of anaerobic bacteria and larger and denser granules than the
   control reactor, indicating that polymer addition possibly contributed
   to the retention of active biomass within the ABR. The average fraction
   of autofluorescent methanogens was lower with 1.5\% being in the initial
   compartments of the ABRs, compared to the last compartment which had
   15\%, showing that each compartment of an ABR had a unique microbial
   composition. Partial spatial separation of anaerobic bacteria appeared
   to have taken place with acidogenic bacteria predominating in the
   initial compartments and methanogenic bacteria predominating in the
   final compartments. Scanning electron micrographs have revealed that the
   dominant bacteria in the initial compartments of the ABR (Compartments 1
   and 2) were those which could consume H-2/CO2 and formate as substrate,
   i.e. Methanobrevibacter. Methanococcus, with populations shifting to
   acetate utilisers, i.e. Methanosaeta. Methanosarcina, in the final
   compartments (Compartments 3 and 4). In addition, there appeared to be a
   stratified structure to the bacterial genera present within the
   granules. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The sorption of Si may decisively influence the P dynamics in surface
   sediment through competitive ligand exchange mechanisms. Many aspects of
   the process, such as the impact of Si dissolving from diatoms. are both
   insufficiently known and difficult to monitor by quantitative analyses
   due to the ubiquitousness of Si in sediment. Since the radioactive
   isotopes of Si have impractical half-times, the applicability of Ge-68
   as a tracer for Si additions in both inorganic and biogenic form to
   freshwater sediment (Lake Vesijarvi. Southern Finland) was studied in a
   24-h laboratory experiment. The Ge-68-label was added to the sediment
   with either inorganic Si (940mgl(-1)) or diatoms (3.2 x 10(6) cells
   1(-1)), and the distributions of the Ge-68-label and the different forms
   of added Si between the interstitial water and sequentially extracted,
   solid-phase sediment pools were critically examined. The inorganic Si
   addition significantly increased the amount of Si in the interstitial
   water and in the reversibly bound fraction, while the diatom addition
   had no discernible effects. The relative distribution of Si and Ge-68
   between the various sediment pools indicated that the first sorption
   phase of the added inorganic Si was similar to that reported for P. The
   high concentration of diatom-derived Ge-68-labelled Si in the
   interstitial water and in the easily soluble, reversibly bound pool
   indicated rapid dissolution of the added diatoms. The comparable
   distributions of the diatom-derived and inorganic Si-derived Ge-68-label
   within the studied pools indicated that the sorption of Si dissolving
   from diatoms in surface sediment closely resembles that of an inorganic
   addition of Si. Caution about the chemical speciation of the Ge-68-label
   is, however, advisable in sediment environments. Fractionation
   procedures designed for e.g. P may also be of limited use when applied
   to a different element, such as Si. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The effect of UV irradiation on human-derived Giardia lamblia cysts (WB
   isolate, cultivated using the gerbil model, and purified to homogeneity)
   was assessed using a 254 nm collimated beam protocol. The infection
   kinetics of UV-exposed cysts were directly compared to the infection
   kinetics of control (non-UV-exposed) cysts. This demonstrated that a UV
   dose at 254 nm resulted in significant inactivation of the Giardia
   cysts. Up to 2 log (99\%) inactivation was observed at a UV dose of
   approximately 10 mJ cm(-2) (range 9.3-11.7 mJ cm(-2)). Higher UV doses
   (between 20 and 40mJ cm(-2)) resulted in up to 3 log (99.9\%)
   inactivation of the cysts. The actual inactivation at these dose levels
   could be higher, but for this study the maximum quantifiable limit of
   cyst inactivation was up to 3 logs (99.9\%).
   Chemical actinometry using the Rahn potassium iodide actinometer was
   used to confirm the UV dose delivered.
   No correlation between a PI/DAPI vital dye viability assay and the
   infectious dose assay was observed. The vital dye viability assay
   demonstrated no inactivation.
   Future work using an alternative UV delivery systems including a
   demonstration-scale device is recommended and more work with a variety
   of isolates is warranted. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Ten compounds with aromatic acid and phenolic structure were chlorinated
   at laboratory conditions and MX analysis by GC/MS at scan mode. None of
   these compounds produced MX, which is contrary to the results of other
   researchers. The whole procedure was investigated and it was found that
   the results obtained at scan mode was more reliable than at SIM mode
   because of the possible interference. The structural characteristic of
   the precursors of MX is proposed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All
