Abstract = {{Polyethoxylated alkylphenols (APnEO, where n is the number of ethylene
   oxide molecules), are non-ionic surfactants widely used for domestic and
   industrial purposes. Most of APnEO are polyethoxylated nonylphenols
   (NPnEO). NPnEO are widespread environmental pollutants with relatively
   low toxicity for mammals and higher toxicity for aquatic organisms. In
   addition, they have been described as endocrine disrupters in recent
   publications.
   One of the main problems related to these surfactants is their
   uncomplete degradation, even in the most effective sewage treatment
   plants. Usually, the final products, more toxic and resistant to
   biological degradation than NPnEO, are nonylphenol (NP), monoethoxylated
   nonylphenol (NP1EO), diethoxylated nonylphenol (NP2EO), nonylphenoxy
   acetic acid (NP1EC), and nonylphenoxyethoxy acetic acid (NP2EC).
   In this paper, the degradation of NPnEO was studied in the different
   processes of a sewage treatment plant. For this purpose, NP, NP1EO and
   NP2EO were analysed in composite samples collected at different points
   along the plant (influent, pre-treatment effluent. primary effluent,
   plant effluent).
   Analyses were carried out by isotopic dilution-HRGC/MS, using available
   labelled nonylphenols (C-13(6)-NP, C-13(6)-NP1EO, C-13(6)-NP2EO) as
   internal standards. Extraction of NPnEO from aqueous samples, previous
   to analysis, was performed by the Likens-Nickerson method (simultaneous
   steam distillation/solvent extraction, SIDE). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The cause of water pollution in the Yodo River was examined regarding
   the mutagenic potentials formed by chlorination of river waters and
   sewage effluents along the river. Mutagenicity of the extracts from
   chlorinated waters was measured by Ames test using S. typhimurium TA100
   strain without metabolic activation. Mutagenic formation potentials of
   sewage effluents were 4-5 times higher than those of the three tributary
   river waters, the Kizu, Uji and Katsura Rivers. The contribution rates
   of the pollution loads from the three river waters and total of four
   sewage effluents to the Yodo River were revealed to be 10.2\%, 42.2\%,
   22.1\% and 25.5\%. respectively. The rate of the sewage effluents
   occupied one-fourth and exceeded the rates of the Kizu and Katsura
   Rivers. The contribution rate of the two sewage effluents to the Katsura
   River was 46.3\%. It could be confirmed that the relationship between
   COD and MFP in river waters and sewage effluents was very high with a
   correlation coefficient. These results indicated that the waters
   inflowing to the Yodo River were contaminated with numerous organic
   compounds, and the sewage effluents especially contribute to the
   formation of genotoxicity by the interaction between chlorine and
   organic components as genotoxic precursors in the purification plants.

Abstract = {{Since the start-up of the St. Lawrence Mesocosm (SLM) at the Montreal
   Biodome in 1992, phosphorus has accumulated slowly, reaching about 18 mg
   Pl(-1) in 2000. It was decided that this concentration should be lowered
   to about 2 mg Pl(-1) to maintain a safe nitrogen: phosporus (N : P)
   ratio of about 10. Before deciding what type of treatment to use for the
   removal of phosphorus, a P budget was estimated for 1998 in order to
   evaluate the different pathways of phosphorus in the mesocosm. The
   resulting budget had only a 1\% difference between the inputs (CV =
   12.9\%) and the sum of the outputs and changes in P pools (CV = 12.5\%).
   P inputs amounted to 40.5 kg for 1998: food for fish and invertebrates
   contributed 76\% of the inputs while seabird guano contributed 20\%.
   Filtration and general cleaning removed 51\% of the inputs while water
   losses removed 22\%. The slight but constant difference between total
   phosphorus and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in 1998 and previous
   years led us to believe that only DRP (mostly orthophosphate)
   accumulated in the system. The accumulation of DRP was 10\% of the
   inputs in 1998. The budget showed that the importance of water losses is
   relative and depends on the DRP concentration in the SLM. Furthermore,
   it was possible to compare this P budget with an N budget of the SLM
   prepared in 1995. The comparison helped us understand why nitrate in
   closed-circuit mesocosms are characterized by a high, never-ending
   accumulation while DRP is characterized by a net increase in the first
   few years after start-up followed by a very small increase in the
   following years. Considering its low CV, this P budget was considered a
   useful water quality management tool in designing a P removal unit for
   the SLM. This budget may also serve as a guideline for managers of
   closed-circuit systems such as marine aquariums and aquacultures as well
   as for designers of P removal units. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A bench-scale anoxic membrane bioreactor (MBR) system, consisting of a
   bioreactor coupled to a ceramic cross-flow ultrafiltration module, was
   evaluated to treat a synthetic wastewater containing alkaline hydrolysis
   byproducts (hydrolysates) of RDX. The wastewater was formulated the same
   as hydrolysis wastewater and consisted of acetate, formate and
   formaldehyde as carbon sources and nitrite and nitrate electron
   acceptors. The MBR system removed 80-90\% of the carbon sources. and
   approximately 90\% of the stoichiometric amount of nitrate, 60\% of
   nitrite. The reactor was also operated over a range of transmembrane
   pressure. temperature, suspended solids concentration, and organic
   loading rate to maximize treatment efficiency and permeate flux.
   Increasing the transmembrane pressure and temperature did not improve
   flux significantly. Increasing mixed liquor volatile suspended solids
   (MLVSS) concentration in the bioreactor decreased the permeate flux
   significantly. The maximum volumetric organic loading rate was 0.72 kg
   COD/m(3)/day. The maximum food-to-mass ratio was 0.50 kg N/kg MLVSS/day
   and 1.82 kg COD/kg MLVSS/day. Membrane permeate was clear and
   essentially free of bacteria, as indicated by heterotrophic plate count.
   Permeate flux ranged between 0.15 and 2.0 m(3)/m(2) day and was
   maintained by routine backwashing every three days. Backwashing with tap
   water containing chlorine bleach every fourth or fifth backwashing was
   able to restore membrane flux to its original value. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Various biological reaction models have been proposed which estimate
   concentrations of soluble and insoluble components in effluent of sewage
   treatment plants. These models should be effective to develop a better
   operation system and plant design, but their formulas consist of
   nonlinear equations, and there are many model constants, which are not
   easy to calibrate. A technique has been proposed to decide the model
   constants by precise experiments, but it is not practical for design
   engineers or process operators to perform these experiments regularly.
   Other approaches which calibrate the model constants by mathematical
   techniques should be used. In this paper, the optimal regulator method
   of modern control theory is applied as a mathematical technique to
   calibrate the model constants. This method is applied in a small sewage
   treatment testing facility. Calibration of the model constants is
   examined to decrease the deviations between calculated and measured
   concentrations. Results show that calculated values of component
   concentrations approach measured values and the method is useful for
   actual plants. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wastewater disinfection by ozone was investigated at pilot scale on
   different wastewater effluents. Variations in operating conditions
   showed that a very low hydraulic retention time (2 min) was sufficient
   for efficient fecal coliform inactivation, provided a sufficient ozone
   dose was transferred to the effluent. Therefore. the transferred ozone
   dose appeared to be the critical parameter for the design of wastewater
   disinfection. As a consequence, the ``Ct{''} approach commonly applied
   in drinking water treatment should not be used for wastewater ozonation.
   Design parameters of ozonation were proposed for two types of
   regulations, and for effluents of different qualities. It was
   demonstrated that only with an efficient filtration step one can meet
   stringent standards such as the California Title 22 criteria. In all
   cases, viruses were totally inactivated: consequently. viruses do not
   constitute a limiting factor in wastewater disinfection by ozone.
   The standard drinking water model failed to match the experimental data
   obtained on real wastewater effluents. A modified approach was
   successfully developed, based on the simultaneous consumption of ozone
   by the microorganisms and the organic matrix. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{There are currently four possible approaches in modeling coagulation
   kinetics: the traditional Euclidean rectilinear; the Euclidean
   curvilinear; the fractal rectilinear; and the fractal curvilinear. The
   fractal model includes the Euclidean case as a subset. The primary
   purpose of this research is to investigate which of the rectilinear
   models among these best predicts the evolution of experimental observed
   particle size distribution (PSD). Using a fractal rectilinear model
   previously developed by the authors, model predictions were compared
   with a series of observed PSD data obtained from estuarine sediment
   particles in a 2 m settling column, where the average velocity gradient
   (G) was 20 or 40s(-1). Nonlinear parameter estimation was performed to
   estimate two free parameters for the fractal model (the fractal
   dimension, D-F, and the collision efficiency factor, alpha), and one
   free parameter (the collision efficiency factor, alpha) for the
   Euclidean model. Compared with the observed PSD, the simulation showed
   that the fractal rectilinear model was best, and that this model fit
   better for the larger size particles. The estimated D-F was between 2.6
   and 3.0. The research demonstrated that the alpha's have multiple values
   for the same observed data, depending on the coagulation model used.
   This finding is significant because a is currently used as a single
   value based on the conventional Euclidean rectilinear model. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The continuously operated laboratory scale Kaldnes moving bed biofilm
   reactor (MBBR) was used for thermophilic (55degreesC) aerobic treatment
   of TMP whitewater. In the MBBR, the biomass is grown on carrier elements
   that move along with the water in the reactor. Inoculation with
   mesophilic activated sludge gave 60-65\% SCOD removal from the first day
   onwards. During the 107 days of experiment, the 60-65\% SCOD removals
   were achieved at organic loading rates of 2.5-3.5 kg SCOD m(-3)d(-1),
   the highest loading rates applied during the run and HRT of 13-22h.
   Carbohydrates, which contributed to 50-60\% of the influent SCOD, were
   removed by 90-95\%, while less than 15 \% of the lignin-like material
   (30-35\% of SCODin) was removed. The sludge yield was 0.23 g VSS g
   SCODTremoved-1. The results show that the aerobic biofilm process can be
   successfully operated under thermophilic conditions. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{To achieve practical treatment of photo-processing waste (PW) using our
   previously proposed sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB)/granular activated
   carbon (GAC) sludge system. this paper elucidates why 3- to 5-X dilution
   of PW was required. That is, a series of experiments were carried out to
   show the effects of high salinity and constituent organic compounds in
   PW, respectively. Both an inorganic salts system and calcination PW
   system showed that SOB completely oxidizes S2O32--S to SO42--S even at
   12.3 or 13.6\% salinity, respectively; hence the dilution requirement is
   not attributable to high salinity. In experiments employing SOB and
   SOB/GAC systems to investigate the effects of 23 constituent compounds
   in PW, compounds were classified into Groups I, II, IIIa, and IIIb. Even
   with 10 g/l GAC, the nine compounds in Group IIIb still exhibited a
   toxic effect on SOB activity at 1- and 3-X dilutions; thus it is these
   compounds that are responsible for requiring dilution of PW.
   Accordingly, a reduction in their use within the photo-developing and
   fix-stabilizing industry, and/or use of > 10 g/l GAC, are new
   considerations for establishing a more practical PW treatment process.

   HRT (in the range 6-46 h) were selected as the most decisive
   technological parameters for a practical application. Average removal
   efficiency of COD found for tested anaerobic reactors were 56-88\%
   (AnSBR) and 46-92\% (UAF) depending on used temperature and HRTs. Based

Abstract = {{Acidic methanol esterification followed by gas chromatography (GC) with
   electron capture detection (ECD) was applied for the determination of

   the use of acidic methanol as the derivatization agent instead of the
   hazardous diazomethane. The recoveries, estimated at concentrations
   ranging from 0.5 to 30 mug/l, are high for eight of the nine haloacetic
   acids, with the only exception being monochloroacetic acid. However,
   problems with this compound have been reported with diazomethane

Abstract = {{Organophosphate pesticides including fenitrothion chlorpyrifos,
   diazinon, methamidophos, edifenphos, mevinphos, fenthion, and acephate
   present in agro-wastewater can be effectively removed by supercritical
   carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) extraction. Near quantitative removal of the
   pesticides from the aqueous solution can be achieved by SC-CO2 at
   90degreesC and 325atm for 20 min of static extraction followed by 40 min
   of dynamic extraction. The extracted pesticides were collected in a
   small amount of Fenton's solution. The pesticides in Fenton's solution
   were degraded completely within an hour after the collection. A
   combination of SC-CO2 extraction and subsequent degradation by Fenton's
   reagent may provide an alternative water purification strategy for
   treating organophosphate pesticides in agro-wastewater. (C) 2002

   this anomaly is also present in the effluents of the municipal sewage

   The anomaly corresponds to a distinct increase of Gd concentrations (up
   to 19 pmol/l) in the river and around 5.4 pmol/l in the lagoon. The
   excess flux of Gd is compatible with the medical use of water soluble Gd

Abstract = {{The Lake Suwa version of the comprehensive aquatic systems model
   (CASM-SUWA) was developed using field data from Lake Suwa, and evaluated
   to examine the utility of CASM-SUWA for assessing the ecological risk of
   chemicals for aquatic ecosystems. The calibration of the parameters for
   the model provided that the established reference model simulation could
   reproduce complex seasonal biomass behavior of populations that were not
   significantly different from the general seasonal pattern for the Lake
   Suwa ecosystem. The sensitivity analyses revealed the potential
   importance of indirect effects and demonstrated that the parameter
   values of all the trophic levels were important in determining the
   biomass of each trophic level in the model. The risk estimation of
   linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) demonstrated that the model
   estimated the risks of direct toxic effects on each population and the
   indirect ecological effects that propagate through the food-web in the
   model ecosystem. The CASM-SUWA-derived benchmark levels were
   approximately one order of magnitude less than the field-derived NOECs
   in literature. The analyses of the comparison implied that the model
   could provide a good basis in determining an ecological protective level
   of a chemical of concern in aquatic ecosystem. This modeling study
   demonstrated that the model can be used to provide additional
   information for the decision-making process in the management of the
   aquatic ecological risk of chemicals. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   Salmonella/microsome assay (Ames test with TA98, TA 100 and TA 102, with
   and without S9 mix) and two micronucleus tests with the plant
   Tradescantia (clone \#4430) and with primary rat hepatocytes. Overall,
   the tested Austrian groundwater samples used for human consumption
   caused only weak genotoxic activities compared to drinking water samples
   reported from other countries under similar experimental conditions.
   With the exception of one weak positive result in the Ames test (only in
   strain TA98 without S9 mix) with an induction factor of 1.9) all samples
   after UV disinfection were devoid of additional mutagenic and
   clastogenic activities compared to the samples before UV disinfection.

Abstract = {{Contamination of groundwater resources by non-aqueous phase liquids
   (NAPLs) has become an issue of increasing environmental concern. This
   study investigated the formation and flow of microemulsions during
   surfactant flushing of NAPL-contaminated soil using the finite
   difference model UTCHEM, which was verified with our laboratory
   experimental data. Simulation results showed that surfactant flushing of
   NAPLs (i.e., trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene) from the
   contaminated soils was an emulsion-driven process. Formation of
   NAPL-in-water microemulsions facilitated the removal of NAPLs from
   contaminated soils. Changes in soil saturation pressure were used to
   monitor the mobilization and entrapment of NAPLs during surface flushing
   process. In general, more NAPLs were clogged in soil pores when the soil
   saturation pressure increased. Effects of aquifer salinity on the
   formation and flow of NAPL-in-water microemulsions were significant.
   This study suggests that the formation and flow of NAPL-in-water
   microemulsions through aquifer systems are complex physical-chemical
   phenomena that are critical to effective surfactant flushing of
   contaminated soils. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{41-48}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The fraction of particles with associated coliform bacteria (PAC) in the
   activated sludge process was evaluated using a 16S rRNA oligonucleotide
   probe specific to the family Enterobacteriaceae. The PAC was found to
   decline exponentially with increasing mean cell residence times (MCRTs).
   The factors influencing the formation of PAC, identified with simplified
   mass balance relationships, are the concentration of particles, the
   concentration of dispersed (non-particle associated) coliform bacteria,
   and the MCRT. The concentration of dispersed coliform bacteria was found
   to decline with increasing MCRTs, The rate of decline was greater than
   the typical half-life attributed to endogenous decay, suggesting that
   other factors (e.g., predation by protozoa) influence the concentration
   of dispersed coliform. bacteria, and subsequently the formation of PAC.
   Given that the association of targeted organisms with particles
   adversely impacts the performance of a disinfection system, studies
   targeted at the fate of organisms other than coliform bacteria in the
   activated sludge process are of paramount importance in assessing the
   health risks of post-disinfected effluents. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) is playing an increasingly
   important role in controlling the eutrophication phenomenon in natural
   waters. It is believed that substrates other than acetate exert
   significant effects on the EBPR process. In this research, it was found
   that glucose could be used as the dominant substrate to induce and
   maintain a successful EBPR process. However, compared to the
   conventional EBPR process using acetate as the dominant substrate, it
   was found that less PO4-P was released into the medium and
   3-hydroxyvalerate (3-HV) enriched poly-p-hydroxyalkanoate (PHA), rather
   than 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) enriched PHA, was accumulated during the
   anaerobic condition, According to the experimental results, a new
   biochemical model is hypothesized for the anaerobic metabolism of
   glucose. It is reasoned that the predominance of 3-HV enriched PHA is
   employed to balance the internal redox during the anaerobic condition.
   The Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway is likely used for anaerobic glucose
   metabolism when the bacteria demonstrate good EBPR performance, because
   the ED pathway necessitates the use of polyphosphate for energy
   purposes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   differences. Three hydroxylated aromatic intermediates resulting from
   the photocatalytic degradation of 4-NT were identified; this suggested
   two (initial) degradation pathways. Formation of acetic acid, formic
   acid, and formaldehyde was also noted. The mineralization products
   included NH4+, NO3- and CO2. N-2 bubbling or the presence of a positive
   hole acceptor during 4-NT degradation resulted in a high 4-aminotoluene
   formation. This indicated an effective reduction of 4-NT's nitro group
   to amino moiety. Generally, Pt-loaded TiO2 (Pt-TiO2) had no influence on
   the disappearance rate of 4-NT. However, the use of Pt-TiO2 along with a
   higher light intensity source resulted in an accelerated TOC removal.

Abstract = {{The kinetics of the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) and of chlorine
   consumption for the chlorination of natural organic matter with an
   excess of chlorine (50 muM > {[}Cl-2](o) > 210 muM) was investigated.
   THM precursors could be divided into a fast and a slowly reacting
   fraction. Long term chlorine demand and the formation of THM could be
   described by second order kinetics. Rate constants were between 0.01 and
   0.03 M-1 s(-1) in the pH range 7-9 for surface waters and humic
   materials extracted from surface waters. A groundwater gave a higher
   rate constant of 0.124 M-1 s(-1). Resorcinol-type structures were tested
   with respect to kinetics and yield of THM formation. They could possibly
   be responsible for the fast reacting THM precursors, which represent
   15-30\% of the THM precursors of natural waters. Additional classes of
   compounds that might contribute to the initial THM formation include
   readily enolizable compounds such as beta -diketones and beta
   -ketoacids. Experiments with phenol showed that slowly reacting THM
   precursors may consist of phenolic compounds. The influence of
   pretreatments (UV/visible irradiation, ozone and chlorine dioxide) on
   chlorine demand and THM formation from NOM was also studied: UV/visible
   irradiation does not alter THM formation but leads to a higher chlorine
   demand. Preoxidation with ozone leads to a lower THM formation with an
   unaltered chlorine demand and preoxidation with chlorine dioxide reduces
   THM formation and the chlorine demand. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title = {{The validity of the Gammarus : Asellus ratio as an index of organic

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{In freshwaters, Gammarus spp. are more sensitive to organic pollution
   than Asellus spp. and the relative abundance of the two taxa has been
   proposed as a pollution index. We tested the validity of this by
   examining the relationship between the Gammarus: Asellus (G:A) ratio and
   (1) a suite of physico-chemical variables, (2) established biotic
   (average score per taxon, ASPT) and richness (species richness (S) and
   Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera families richness (EPT family
   richness)) indices generated from the macro invertebrate community. In
   addition, we investigated a suspected biotic interaction, predation,
   between Gammarus and Asellus. Both univariate and multivariate analyses
   showed that the G:A ratio was sometimes responsive to changes in
   parameters linked to organic pollution, such as BOD5 and nitrate levels.
   However, the G: A ratio also appeared responsive to variables not
   directly linked to organic pollution, such as conductivity and distance
   from source. There were significant positive correlations among the G:A
   ratio and the ASPT, S and EPT, indicating that changes in the relative
   abundances of Gammarus and Asellus were reflected in changes in the
   pollution sensitivity and richness of the wider macroinvertebrate
   community. A laboratory experiment revealed significant predation of
   Asellus aquaticus juveniles by Gammarus duebeni celticus adults, but no
   reciprocal predation. We propose that the G:A ratio may be useful as a
   crude measure of organic pollution that could supplement more complex
   indices in a multimetric approach to pollution monitoring or be used for
   monitoring individual sites, where a simple technique is required for
   monitoring purposes over a period of time. Also, we urge recognition of
   the possible role of biotic interactions among taxa used in the
   generation of pollution indices. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was electro-generated in a parallel-plate
   electrolyzer by reduction of dissolved oxygen (DO) in acidic solutions
   containing dilute supporting electrolyte. Operational parameters such as
   cathodic potential, oxygen purity and mass flow rate, cathode surface
   area, pH, temperature, and inert supporting electrolyte concentration
   were systematically investigated as to improve the Faradic current
   efficiency of H2O2 generation. Results indicate that significant
   self-decomposition of H2O2 only occurs at high pH ( > 9) and elevated
   temperatures (> 23 degreesC). Results also indicate that the optimal
   conditions for H2O2 generation are cathodic potential of -0.5 V vs.
   saturated calomel electrode (SCE), oxygen mass flow rate of 8.2 x 10(-2)
   mol/min, and pH 2. Under the optimal conditions, the average current
   density and average current efficiency are 6.4 A/m(2) and 81\%,
   respectively. However, when air is applied at the optimal flow rate of
   oxygen, the average current density markedly decreases to 2.1 A/m(2),
   while the average current efficiency slightly increases to 90\%. The
   limiting current density is 6.4 A/m(2), which is independent of cathode
   geometry and surface area. H2O2 generation is favored at low
   temperatures. In the concentration range studied (0.01-0.25 M), the
   inert supporting electrolyte (NaClO4) affects the total potential drop
   of the electrolyzer, but does not affect the net generation rate of
   H2O2. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work deals with the treatment of offshore oilfield wastewater from
   the Campos Basin (Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil). After coarse
   filtration, this high saline wastewater was microfiltrated through mixed
   cellulose ester (MCE) membranes, resulting in average removals of COD,
   TOC, O\&G and phenols of 35\%, 25\%, 92\% and 35\%, respectively. The
   permeate effluent was fed into a 1-L air-lift reactor containing
   polystyrene particles of 2 mm diameter, used as support material. This
   reactor was operated for 210 days, at three hydraulic retention times
   (HRT): 48, 24 and 12 h. Even when operated at the lowest HRT (12 h),
   removal efficiencies of 65\% COD, 80\% TOC, 65\% phenols and 40\%
   ammonium were attained. The final effluent presented COD and TOC values
   of 230 and 55 mg/L, respectively. Results obtained by gas chromatography
   analyses and toxicity tests with Artemia salina showed that a
   significant improvement in the effluent's quality was achieved after
   treatment by the combined (microfiltration/biological) process. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Bacterial and colloid transport experiments related to environmental
   systems are typically performed in the laboratory, with sand often used
   as the porous media. In order to prepare the sand, mechanical sieving is
   frequently used to tighten the sand grain size distribution. However,
   mechanical sieving has been reported to provide insufficient
   repeatability between identical colloidal transport experiments. This
   work examined the deficiencies of mechanical sieving with respect to
   bacterial transport through sand columns. It was found that sieving with
   standard brass sieves (1) contaminates the sand with copper and zinc as
   a linear function of sieving time and (2) inefficiently sizes sand
   grains below 300 mum (the largest size examined in this study) due to
   rapid clogging of the sieves. A procedure was developed that allows
   utilization of brass sieves for sizing the sand grains and removes the
   metal contamination introduced from the sieves. Bacterial transport
   experiments utilizing this column preparation procedure gave repeatable
   breakthrough curves. Further examination of the effects of these
   treatments on bacterial transport showed interesting results. First, it
   was found that the metal contamination did not affect the clean-bed
   bacterial transport. Second, it was found that variations of the column
   flushing procedure did not alter the clean-bed breakthrough of the
   bacteria, but did alter the inter-particle blocking. Finally, it was
   found that the shape of the sand grains (oblong vs. rounded)
   significantly alters the bacterial transport, with the transport being
   dominated by the smallest dimension of the oblong grains. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The determination of the total concentration of selenium does not
   provide sufficient information about its toxicity and its
   bioavailability. The determination of its chemical forms is the basis
   for understanding the biogeochemical cycle in terrestrial and aquatic
   ecosystems and for detecting the species which might be toxic to biota.
   In this work we describe an analytical procedure to carry out the redox
   speciation of selenium present at Ultratrace levels in rainwater from
   sites of Valparaiso region in Chile, impacted by mining activities of
   copper ores. A simple preconcentration step of the rainwater sample on a
   rotavapor system, in vacuum at low temperature permits the concentration
   of the different redox selenium species until levels quantifiable by
   sensitive techniques such as differential pulse cathodic stripping
   voltammetry or by spectrometric techniques, based on the hydride
   generation and detection by atomic absorption or atomic fluorescence
   spectrometry. These techniques coupled to redox chemical reactions allow
   the redox speciation of selenium. The results show that the open
   evaporation system can be used to concentrate water samples when the aim
   of the analysis is the determination of the total selenium
   concentration. On the contrary, to carry out its redox speciation only
   the preconcentration. performed on rotavapor system, in vacuum can be
   used. When synthetic solutions containing different redox species of
   selenium, at ultratrace levels, were slowly evaporated on open system,
   Se(II) and Se(IV) were oxidized. The optimized procedure was then
   applied to the selenium determination and its redox speciation in
   rainwater samples collected in sites impacted by mining activities of
   copper ores. It was found that the amounts of total selenium in
   rainwater, as copper, from Puchuncavi valley decrease exponentially with
   the distance from the source, indicating that these elements in this
   region arise from the industrial complex Las Ventanas. In the redox
   speciation of selenium, Se(IV) and Se(VI) were the species found in all
   rainwater samples analyzed, providing selenium in species which are most
   favorable for their uptake by the vegetation grown in these soils. (C)

Abstract = {{The introduction of ultra-low pressure reverse osmosis (ULPRO) membrane
   has widened the horizon of reverse osmosis (RO) in purification of
   surface water and wastewater as well as desalination of brackish water.
   The ULPRO membrane chemistry can provide a high water flux at low
   operating pressure, while maintaining a very good salt and organics
   rejection. This paper deals with the investigation on the rejection of
   low molecular weight organic compounds by ULPRO membrane. Laboratory
   scale experiments were carried out at a pressure of 3 kg/cm(2) with a
   feed flow rate of 1.20 l/min. The rejection of undissociated organic
   compounds did not show a close relationship with the feed PH. The
   percentage removal of undissociated organic compounds increased linearly
   with the molecular weight as well as with the molecular width. The
   removal efficiency can be predicted by these relationships. But neither
   molecular weight nor molecular width can be considered as an absolute
   factor for rejection. The feed PH also influenced the removal efficiency
   of dissociated organic compounds. The efficiency decreased linearly with
   the increase in the dissociation constant. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This space-time study of bacteriological response compared the presence
   of pathogens with indicators contained in surface and groundwater in
   mountainous regions. A systematic search for bacteria such as Listeria,
   Salmonella, Campylobacter and Yersinia carried out simultaneously with a
   search for indicators has shown that these waters can occasionally
   contain potentially pathogens, though these are generally to be found in
   small quantities. The most common pathogens found are Campylobacter and
   Listeria. Salmonella has never been isolated. The presence of pathogens
   is usually accompanied by the presence of classic indicators of
   contamination such as Escherichia coli, enterococci and other aerobic
   bacteria. Exceptions are only to be observed in cases of samples
   presenting very low numbers of pathogens. Such low pathogen levels have
   a minimal impact on human health; but we cannot exclude that, during
   periods affected by specific conditions, higher levels might temporarily
   occur. Our research has demonstrated that classic indicators can be
   considered as efficient detectors of pathogens in most cases. When these
   indicators are used systematically and regularly, the human health
   hazard can be qualified as low but not negligible. The presence of
   pathogens, together with their survival capacity, brings the protection
   measures currently applied to safeguard drinking waters sharply into
   question. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing incidence of algal blooms in fresh water supplies and the
   consequent possibility of cyanobacterial microcystin contamination of
   potable water is a cause of recent concern. Heterogeneous photocatalytic
   oxidation forms part of a family of advanced water treatment
   technologies comprising the generation of reactive oxidizing species in
   water media and results in the complete oxidative degradation
   (mineralization) of organic pollutants to yield carbon dioxide, water
   and inorganic ions. A new experimental laboratory-scale `falling film'
   reactor has been developed to Study the photocatalytic degradation of
   microcystins in aqueous solution. The reactor consisted of a fiberglass
   sheet impregnated with immobilized titanium dioxide (TiO2) catalyst over
   which the microcystin solution was pumped (as a falling film) while
   being irradiated from UV-C germicidal lamps. The design of the system
   obviated the necessity to separate suspended catalyst from treated water
   as required in slurry reactors. The photocatalytic degradation was
   characterized by pseudo-first order reaction kinetics. Rapid degradation
   of microcystins LR, YR and RR was observed in natural lake water with
   half lives less than 10 min, while even faster rates were achieved in
   laboratory distilled water. Although low pH (pH 3) marginally improved
   reaction rates, the presence of radical scavengers such as sulfate ions
   was detrimental to the photocatalytic oxidation process. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The performance of a rotating biological contactor (RBC) for the
   post-treatment of the effluent of an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket
   (UASB) was the subject of this study. Different hydraulic and organic
   loading rates have been investigated. The removal efficiencies of
   CODtotal, CODsuspended, CODcolloidal and CODsoluble increased at a
   higher hydraulic retention time (HRT) and a lower influent organic
   loading rate.
   The results obtained indicated that a two-stage RBC reactor at an HRT of
   10 h and an organic loading rate of 6.4 g COD m(-2) d(-1) represents an
   effective post-treatment process. Most CODsuspended and CODcolloidal
   were removed in the first stage while nitrification proceeded in the
   second stage.
   The overall nitrification efficiency was 92\% at an ammonia loading rate
   of 1.1 g m(-2) d(-1). Total E. coli removal at HRTs of 10, 5 and 2.5 h
   were 99.5\%, 99.0\% and 89.0\%, respectively. The major part of
   suspended E. coli (>4.4 mum) was removed by sedimentation or by
   adsorption in the biofilm of the first stage of RBC (99.66\%). However,
   E. coli in the colloidal fraction (< 4.4 to > 0.45 mum) was eliminated
   in the second stage of RBC (99.78\%).
   A comparison of the performance of a one-stage versus two-stage RBC
   system, operated at the same total loading rate, revealed an improvement
   in the effluent quality of the two-stage effluent as compared to the
   one-stage effluent.
   The two stages RBC were used to examine the effect of hydraulic shock
   loads on reactor performance in terms of COD, nitrification and E. coli
   removal. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-component numerical leach model (SBLEM) was developed by
   coupling a general chemical speciation code with a modified
   Crank-Nicolson algorithm to determine the leaching behavior of
   contaminants in stabilized/solidified (s/s) wastes. The thermodynamic
   database of the speciation code was modified using batch leaching data.
   SBLEM was evaluated by simulating a dynamic leaching test of
   cement-treated combined bottom and fly ash from a municipal solid waste
   (MSW) incinerator. Simulations used an input composition prepared from
   acid neutralization capacity (ANC) test data of the ash. The results
   show that SBLEM can reasonably predict the dynamic leaching behavior of
   metals from the cement-treated ash when the ANC of the ash and
   pH-solubility curves of metals are well described. This indicates SBLEM
   simulations may be able to augment or replace experimental leaching
   tests that can consume a substantial period of time ( > 2 months) and in
   some cases, provide unreliable results. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Sulfate-reducing reactive walls installed in situ in the path of acid
   mine drainage contaminated groundwater, present a promising passive
   treatment technology. However, a rigorous and methodical selection of
   the most appropriate reactive mixture composition still needs to be
   investigated. The aim of this study was the selection of the most
   reactive medium using a multiple factor design and the modeling of the
   sulfate-reduction rate. Reactivity of 17 mixtures was assessed in batch
   reactors (in duplicates) using a synthetic AMD. Results indicate that
   within 41 days, sulfate concentrations decreased from initial
   concentrations of 2000-3200 mg/l to final concentrations of < 90 mg/l.
   Metal removal efficiencies ranged between 51-84\% for Ni and 73-93\% for
   Zn. Generated sulfate-reduction rate predictive models which had very
   satisfactory parameters (R-2 = 0.86, F = 62.38 (p-level < 10(-13)) and
   R-2 = 0.90, F = 62.30 (p-level < 10(-13))) identified poultry manure and
   two other carbon sources as the critical variables for sulfate-reduction

Abstract = {{The main objective of this study was to assess the effect of temperature
   (4-30 degreesC) on the inactivation kinetics of Cryptosporidium parvum
   oocysts with sequential disinfection schemes involving the use of
   chlorine dioxide as the primary disinfectant and free or combined
   chlorine as the secondary disinfectant in synthetic water. The synergy
   previously reported for sequential inactivation of C. parvum oocysts
   with ozone/free chlorine or ozone/combined chlorine did not occur when
   chlorine dioxide was used, instead of ozone, as the primary disinfectant
   within the temperature range (4-30 degreesC) and the pre-treatment
   levels investigated. Sequential ozone ``chlorine dioxide and chlorine
   dioxide/ozone experiments revealed that the lower level or absence of
   synergy for chlorine dioxide/free chlorine and chlorine
   dioxide/monochloramine was likely the result of chlorine dioxide
   reacting with oocyst chemical groups that are mostly different from
   those reacting with ozone, free chlorine, or monochloramine. The CT
   concept was found to be valid for the primary inactivation kinetics of
   C. parvum oocysts with chlorine dioxide, thus allowing the use of the
   simpler CT approach for the development of C. parvum inactivation
   requirements with chlorine dioxide. General consistency was found
   between the secondary inactivation kinetics of C. parvum oocysts with.
   free chlorine and monochloramine after chlorine dioxide pretreatment
   obtained in this study with oocyst viability determined by a modified in
   vitro excystation method and those reported in the literature for the
   same sequential disinfection schemes based on an animal infectivity

Abstract = {{Some farm wastes have been analysed for their fluorescence properties
   using fluorescence excitation-matrix (EEM) spectroscopy. Farm wastes
   investigated were silage liquor, pig and cattle slurry, and sheep barn
   waste. All farm wastes exhibited high intensities of fluorescence that
   can be attributed to the protein tryptophan. Silage liquor was
   characterised by a very high fluorescence intensity and an initial
   tryptophan: fulvic-like fluorescence intensity ratio of > 20. Cattle and
   pig slurries exhibited a lower tryptophan: fulvic-like fluorescence
   intensity ratio (similar to2-5) and lower tryptophan fluorescence
   intensity, and tyrosine fluorescence was also observed. Sheep barn
   wastes had the lowest tryptophan: fulvic-like fluorescence intensity
   ratios (similar to0.5-4.0). Farm waste samples were reanalysed under
   controlled temperature conditions over a period of 50 days after
   sampling, to investigate the stability of their fluorescence properties.
   For silage liquor, tryptophan: fulvic-like fluorescence intensity ratios
   were observed to decrease with time, and were associated with a decrease
   in tryptophan fluorescence intensity, suggestive of clostridia breakdown
   of protein. For slurry samples, tryptophan: fulvic-like fluorescence
   intensity exhibited a more variable time-evolution, and tryptophan
   fluorescence intensity increased through time; the more complex
   fluorescence signal is due to the relatively heterogeneous nature of the
   slurry. Sheep barn waste samples exhibited more stable tryptophan:
   fulvic-like fluorescence intensity ratio and tryptophan intensities,
   suggesting these samples were more stable due to their greater age and
   decomposition. The ratios of tryptophan: fulvic-like fluorescence
   intensity observed from the farm wastes investigated are significantly
   higher than those observed in the majority of river waters, suggesting
   that farm waste pollution events could leave a signature in river waters
   due to their distinctively high protein fluorescence intensity. (C) 2001

   adsorbent the preconcentration process can also be performed in water
   samples containing suspended solids, After elution of the captured dyes,
   their presence in eluates was detected spectrophotometrically.
   Concentrations of both clues in the range 0.5-1.0 mug l(-1) of water
   could be reproducibly detected. The dyes can be detected not only in

Abstract = {{The two-stage anaerobic wastewater pre-treatment was modelled and
   controlled. The biological state of the reactors could be predicted
   using a fuzzy logic system and based upon this, proper control actions
   were taken automatically in order to avoid in overload. The system was
   designed to handle very strong fluctuations in the concentration of the
   substrate and the volumetric loading rate. Hydrogen concentration
   together with methane concentration, gas production rate, pH and the
   filling level of the acidification buffer tank were used as input
   variables for the fuzzy logic system. The manipulated variables were the
   flow rate from the acidification buffer tank into the methane reactor,
   the temperature and pH of both reactors, the circulation rate of the
   fixed bed reactor, back flow from the methane reactor into the
   acidification, and the control of the feed into the acidification buffer
   tank. The developed control system was successfully tested on a fully
   automated lab scale two-stage anaerobic digester. Different types of
   wastewater from food processing industries were successfully applied.
   Even a restart of feeding with very high COD concentrations (100 gl(-1))
   after several days of stand by was handled successfully. Effluent
   concentrations could be kept low without using TOC, COD or equivalent
   measurements. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The on-line titration of volatile fatty acids (VFA) was found to be a
   reliable method to measure the substrate (metabolite) concentration
   without the use of expensive analytical devices. A measurement cell was
   designed that ensures stable long-term operation, high throughputs and
   copes with both very low and very high VFA, concentrations. Using
   synthetic textile wastewater, a recalibration of the pH probe was
   necessary only twice a week. A good reproducibility of the VFA
   concentrations was determined and standard deviations were below +/- 1\%
   of the measured concentration. Changing salt concentrations of the
   wastewater in the range of 2.5-150 g l(-1) NaCl did not influence the
   determined VFA concentration significantly. The method was suitable to
   control the hydraulic retention time in an acidic phase reactor and to
   determine the acidification rates of wastewater compounds in batch
   experiments. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A series of soil slurry experiments were performed in a carefully
   conceived reactor set-up to investigate the characteristics of the
   catalytic decomposition of ozone on a sand and iron surface. Real time
   on-line monitoring of ozone in the reaction module was possible using
   flow injection analysis coupled with a computer-cont rolled UV detector
   and data acquisition system. The effects of the soil media and size,
   ozone dosage, pH and p-CBA as a probe compound were examined at the
   given experimental conditions. Two apparent phases existed, and ozone
   instantaneously decomposed within one second in the first phase. These
   were defined as the instantaneous ozone demand (ID) phase, and the
   relatively slow decay stage. The interactions of ozone with the soil
   organic matter (SOM) and metal oxides were attributed mostly to the
   instantaneous decomposition of ozone. From the probe (p-CBA)
   experiments, 60-68\% of total p-CBA removal occurred during the ID
   phase. The generation of hydroxyl radicals (OH .) was demonstrated and
   was closely related with metal oxides as well as SOM. Metal oxides in
   soil surface were considered to have relatively faster reaction rate
   with ozone and provide more favorable reactive sites to generate higher
   amount of OH . than SOM. Even at one-tenth concentration of the sands, a
   goethite-induced catalytic reaction outfitted the removal rate of p-CBA
   among all the soils tested. More than 40\% of total p-CBA removal
   occurred on the soil surface. It was inferred that the radical reaction
   with the probe compound seemed to take place not only on the soil
   surface but also in the solid-liquid interface. Ozone decomposition and
   the reaction between OH . and p-CBA appeared to be independent of any
   change in pH. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of an immobilized-cell reactor for simultaneous carbon
   nitrogen removal in synthetic wastewater with an intermittent aeration
   (IA) process under real-time control of oxygen supply was investigated.
   The oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) was monitored during operation.
   The ORP-time profile showed distinctive turning points, which directly
   correlated with the changes in the system chemistry and biological
   activity. The reactor was conducted by cyclic fixed-time
   aeration-nonaeration operation at the beginning, followed by real-time
   control technology using ORP setpoint. A moving window along the slope
   of the ORP curve was employed to search for the nitrate breakpoint of
   the aeration cycle. Once the breakpoint was found, the reactor was
   aerated for a fixed period. The treatment process could effectively
   avoid the anoxic fermentation state under the real-time control. The
   cycle time was reduced around 30\%. The duration of aeration period was
   found to be optimum at 3 h under the consideration of the removal
   efficiencies of COD and total nitrogen. The real-time control system not
   only exhibited a better nitrogen removal efficiency than the fixed-time
   control operation, but it also showed a stable effluent quality during
   the change of HRT from 3 to 8 h. Good operation stability was
   demonstrated even when a very high disturbance of the influent loading
   occurred. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Deep seawater has recently been under trial as a fundamental material
   for mineral water, food, face lotion and an efficacious reagent for the
   cure of atopic dermatitis in Japan. However, little is known about the
   biologically effective substances, including toxic compounds in deep
   seawater. In this study, we investigated the effects of deep seawater on
   the function of murine macrophages in vitro, and examined the
   endotoxin-like substances in seawater, Mitochondrial activity and NO
   production in macrophage cells cultured with stimulants were enhanced in
   a depth dependent manner by pretreatment with deep seawater. In
   addition, fractions from deep seawater, enriched by hydrophobic column
   chromatography, activated the macrophage cells much more than the
   corresponding fractions from surface seawater. Furthermore, the effects
   of the fractions on macrophage cells remained significant, even with the
   addition of polymyxin B, which is a specific inhibitor of endotoxins.
   These results indicate that endotoxins and unknown substances, which
   affect macrophage functions, exist in a depth dependent manner in
   seawater. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   tap water samples were examined for infectious enteroviruses and
   adenoviruses by a cell culture technique followed by polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) amplification. To identify the recovered viruses,
   sequence analysis of PCR products was performed. Infectious
   enteroviruses and adenoviruses were detected in 11 (47.8\%) and 9
   (39.1\%) of the samples, respectively. Both enteroviruses and
   adenoviruses were detected in five samples (21.7\%). The level of viral
   contamination was quite high, ranging from 2 x 10(-3) to 2.9 x 10(-2)
   Most Probable Number of Infectious Unit L-1, far above the recommended
   virus level in drinking water set by the US EPA. Poliovirus type 1
   derived from vaccine was frequently detected and the remainder comprised
   coxsackievirus B type or echovirus type 6, which were causative agents
   of aseptic meningitis in Korea in 1997 and 1998, respectively. Several
   types of adenovirus were detected in tap water samples and some water

Abstract = {{As an aid to the design and operation of anaerobic digesters treating
   high sulphate waste waters, a mathematical model describing this
   treatment process has been developed. Apart from sulphate reduction, the
   model includes those reactions which occur either prior to sulphate
   reduction or in competition with it. These include, hydrolysis of solid
   substrates, acidogenesis, beta oxidation of long chain fatty acids,
   acetogenesis and methanogenesis. By incorporating terms for these
   reactions the model is able to simulate sulphate reduction using a wide
   range of carbon sources. Acid/base equilibrium chemistry is included in
   order to predict the pH and unionized component concentrations, needed
   for calculating inhibition. An activity based model is used, with the
   activity coefficients calculated using Debye-Huckle theory. The mass
   transfer rates of hydrogen, methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen
   sulphide from the liquid to the vapour phase are also included. A number
   of different reactor types may be simulated, including a dynamic batch,
   steady state CSTR and dynamic CSTR. By separating the hydraulic and
   solids residence times, high rate reactors such as UASB and packed bed
   reactors may also be simulated. The model has been used to successfully
   predict the dynamic and steady state behaviour of a number of different
   reactor types, utilizing both simple and complex carbon sources. (C)

Abstract = {{Iodinated X-ray contrast media are pharmaceuticals which are
   biologically inert and metabolically stable during their passage through
   the body and are excreted almost completely within a day into waste
   water. They are not readily biodegradable. However, in a test system
   simulating sewage treatment, we were able to show that the model
   compound iopromide
   (N,N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodo-5-methoxyacetylamino-N-meth
   yliso-phthalamide) was amenable to primary degradation. The resulting
   degradation product
   (5-amino-N,N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodo-N-methyliso-phthala
   mide) showed a faster photolysis than the parent compound. Additionally
   this product was further degraded in a test system simulating surface
   water conditions. Short-term toxicity of the primary degradation product
   was low, i.e. no effects on any of various aquatic species could be
   found even at concentrations of I g l(-1). Additionally no chronic
   toxicity of the degradation product was observed in an early-life stage
   test with zebrafish at the highest tested concentration of 100 mg l(-1).
   Based on the results from model systems a degradation pathway for
   iopromide is postulated. Though further work showing the transferability
   of the laboratory results to environmental conditions is necessary the
   presently available information on the environmental fate and effects of
   iopromide and its degradation products do not provide evidence of a risk
   for aquatic life caused by the introduction of this contrast medium into
   waste water. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to achieve a better understanding of the
   behavior of fecal coliform populations on the vegetation and in the soil
   after slurry spreading in environmental conditions, typical of
   vegetative growth period in mountain hay meadows. Changes in fecal
   coliform populations on the vegetation and in the soil were monitored in
   situ for 3 months after slurry spreading on 9 plots. The variations
   found in populations are related to the agricultural, soil. and climatic
   characteristics of plots and to the moisture regime of soils. These
   observations are compared with laboratory experiments on undisturbed
   soil microcosms. In absence of water flux, survival durations recorded
   in the laboratory and in the field are of the same order of magnitude.
   The data enable us to pinpoint the influence of various factors
   affecting the decline and transfer of fecal bacteria in the plant-soil
   system and consequently to discuss the risk management of water

Abstract = {{A thermally enhanced pump-and-treatment method for pentachlorophenol
   (PCP)-contaminated soil and ground-water has shown potential advantages

   quantitative assessment of the newly proposed method. Five series of
   desorption batch tests were conducted at different temperatures, and the
   test results were analyzed by linear regression to determine the
   best-fit kinetic model for PCP desorbed from the contaminated field soil
   under all temperature conditions. The first-order kinetic model,
   parabolic diffusion model. and modified Freundlich model were discussed
   in linear regression work. A modified Freundlich model was found to
   describe the PCP desorption kinetics from soil in consideration of a

Abstract = {{Leachate is a contaminated liquor resulting from the disposal of solid
   and liquid wastes at landfill sites that must be treated before
   discharge. Vegetated leachate treatment planes have been used at
   landfill sites in the UK but have received little scientific attention.
   This paper describes studies of model leachate, treatment planes with a
   focus on the removal of ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N). Small-scale and
   field-scale experimental treatment planes were constructed, filled with
   clay loam soil and vegetated with grass (Agrostis stolonifera). Landfill
   leachate was applied at hydraulic loading rates ranging from
   17-2171/m(2)/d. An exponential relationship was used to characterise the
   pattern of NH3-N removal. No relationship was observed between the
   hydraulic loading rate and the NH3-N removal rate constants (R-2 =
   0.0039). The daily specific NH3-N mass removal rate was found to be
   linearly related to the NH3-N concentration at the start of that day of
   treatment (R-2 = 0.35). Possible causes of variation in the rate of
   NH3-N removal between experiments are discussed. A simple inorganic
   nitrogen balance indicated that the mass of NH3-N and NO2-N removed was
   not accounted for by NO3-N production. Explanations for this apparent
   nitrogen deficit are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Due to their chemical and thermal stability, perfluorinated surfactants
   (PFSs) are promising materials for the development of novel
   environmental remediation applications. This stability also leads to the
   persistence of PFS in the environment; therefore, their properties and
   behavior should be well understood. This study focused on polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and PFS interactions, particularly the
   solubilization of PAHs by PFS micelles. Naphthalene. phenanthrene, and
   pyrene were selected as representative PAHs and an anionic PFS. ammonium
   perfluorooctanoate (APFO) was used. Critical micelle concentration (CMC)
   values of APFO measured by surface tension, fluorescence probe, and
   solubility enhancement methods fell in the range of 20-30 mM at 22 +/- 1
   degreesC. Apparent solubilities of molecular oxygen and PAHs in APFO
   micellar solutions depended linearly on the APFO concentration. Molar
   solubilization ratio (MSR) values were determined to be 9.50 x 10(-4),
   4.17 x 10(-3), 2.31 x 10(-4), and 4.09 x 10(-5) and mole fraction
   micellar partition coefficient (K-mic) values were found to be 1.89 x
   10(2), 9.50 x 10(2), 2.12 x 10(3), and 3.79 x 10(3) for oxygen,
   naphthalene, phenanthrene, and pyrene, respectively at 22 +/- 1
   degreesC. log K-mic values for three PAHs were shown to be linearly
   correlated with the log values of octanol-water partition coefficients
   (log K-ow). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) solubilized in perfluorinated
   surfactant (PFS) solutions were degraded by direct photolysis and
   UV/H2O2 process. The subsequent recovery and reuse of these surfactant
   solutions were also demonstrated. Phenanthrene and pyrene were selected
   as representative PAHs and an anionic PFS; ammonium perfluorooctanoate
   (APFO) was used, In our experiments, micellar APFO solutions retarded
   the phenanthrene photolysis and enhanced the pyrene photolysis. The
   results indicate that the photochemical reactivity of compound in
   micelles is strongly dependent on specific properties of the
   solubilizate, possibly due to the different excited state behaviors of
   compound. UV/H2O2 process exhibits a greatly enhanced rate of PAH
   photolysis in both water and APFO compared to direct photolysis,
   indicating that hydroxyl radicals may be generated or penetrated at the
   sites of PAHs solubilized in the micelles. Additionally, a smaller rate
   enhancement by UV/H2O2 in micelles than in water suggests that micelles
   provide some degree of protection from hydroxyl radical attack. The
   possibility of recovery and reuse of PFS has been demonstrated by
   measuring the solubilizing capacity of APFO after direct photolysis and
   UV/H2O2 process. Overall, this study demonstrates UV/H2O2 process can be
   an effective treatment method for not only PAH degradation but also
   surfactant recovery and reuse. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The concentrations and loading rates of pesticides used in paddy fields
   were investigated over a period of 5 years in the Seta River, which is
   the only natural outlet of Lake Biwa. The lake's water catchment area is
   3174 km(2) 20\% of which contains paddy fields. Water samples were also
   collected in six rivers flowing into the lake in order to compare the
   contamination level and concentration profile. The pesticides analyzed
   were four herbicides (molinate, simetryn, oxadiazon, and thiobencarb),
   one fungicide (isoprothiolane), and two insecticides (diazinon and
   fenitrothion). Molinate, simetryn, oxadiazon and isoprothiolane were
   found at the higher frequencies with maximum concentrations of 1.1, 0.4,
   0.1 and 0.5 mug/l in the effluent river, one or two order of magnitude
   higher than that of effluent in influent rivers. These peak
   concentrations were observed during the application period in influent
   rivers and two or three weeks after that in effluent river. The
   frequency of occurrence of thiobencarb, diazinon, and fenitrothion was
   relatively low and their maximum concentrations in the effluent remained
   below 0.1 mug/l. The decrease of molinate, simetryn and oxadiazon
   concentrations in the effluent river were approximated by two straight
   lines plotted on semilogarithmic scale. Increased loading was induced by
   intense rainfall, which took place during the application period.
   Simetryn and isoprothiolane persisted in relatively high concentrations
   through the year were also influenced on its loading by the heavy
   rainfall in the following months. The percentages of the total amount of
   pesticides released through Lake Biwa to the basin in downstream were
   estimated to be 1.3-2.9\% for molinate, 5.4-10.0\% for simetryn,
   0.6-1.3\% for oxadiazon, 0.2-0.9\% for thiobencarb, 1.8-6.6\% for
   isoprothiolane, 0.3-2.1\% for diazinon, and 0\% for fenitrothion. (C)

Abstract = {{Factorial experiments were conducted using source waters from seven
   drinking water treatment plants in Ontario, Canada to develop
   statistically based model equations capable of predicting chlorine
   dioxide consumption and chlorite and chlorate formation upon chlorine
   dioxide application. The equations address raw water quality and
   operational parameters including pH, temperature, chlorine dioxide
   concentration, reaction time and water organic content (as described by
   non-purgeable organic carbon x ultraviolet absorbance measured at 254
   nm, NPOC x UV254). Terms describing two-factor interaction effects were
   also included, improving the accuracy of the predictive equations in
   fitting measured response concentrations as evaluated through internal
   and external validations. Nearly 80\% of the predictions for chlorine
   dioxide consumption and chlorite formation were observed to be within
   20\% of the measured levels. Over 90\% of the predicted chlorate levels
   were within +/- 0.1 mg,/L of the measured levels. Chlorine dioxide
   concentration and NPOC x UV254 were key parameters when developing the
   predictive models. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the long-term dynamics of phosphorus concentrations
   in both the lake water and the sediment in a subtropical Chinese lake,
   Lake Donghu. The total phosphorus (TP) concentration in the lake water
   experienced an upward trend from the 1950s, and peaked in 1983/1984, but
   declined obviously afterwards. From the 1950s to the 1990s, TP content
   in the upper 10 cm sediment of the lake increased steadily from 0.307 to
   1.68 mg Pg DW-1 at Station I and from 0.151 to 0.89 mg Pg DW-1 at
   Station II, respectively. The TP increase in the lake water before
   mid-1980s was mainly attributed to the massive input of sewage P. The
   outbreak of cyanobacterial blooms coincided with the peaks of TP and
   Orthophosphate (PO4-P) in the water in mid-1980s, and the maximum TP of
   the water reached as high as 1.349 mg/1 at Station I and 0.757 mg/l at
   Station II (in 1984), respectively. The declines of TP and PO4-P in the
   water after mid-1980s was coincident with the disappearance of
   cyanobacterial bloom. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Salinity is an important indicator for water quality and aquatic
   ecosystem in tidal rivers. The increase of salinity intrusion in a river
   may have an adverse effect on the aquatic environment system. This study
   presents an application of the artificial neural network (ANN) to assess
   salinity variation responding to the multiple Forcing functions of
   freshwater input, tide, and wind in Apalachicola River, Florida.
   Parameters in the neural network model were trained until the model
   predictions of salinity matched well with the observations. Then, the
   trained model was validated by applying the model to another independent
   data set. The results indicate that the ANN model is capable of
   correlating the non-linear time series of salinity to the multiple
   forcing signals of wind, tides, and freshwater input in the Apalachicola
   River. This study suggests that the ANN model is an easy-to-use modeling
   tool fbr engineers and water resource managers to obtain a quick
   preliminary assessment of salinity variation in response to the
   engineering modifications to the river system. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Application of novel analytical and investigative methods such as
   fluorescence in situ hybridization, confocal laser scanning microscopy
   (CLSM), microelectrodes and advanced numerical simulation has led to new
   insights into micro-and macroscopic processes in bioreactors. However,
   the question is still open whether or not these new findings and the
   subsequent gain of knowledge are of significant practical relevance and
   if so, where and how. To find suitable answers it is necessary for
   engineers to know what can be expected by applying these modern
   analytical tools. Similarly, scientists could benefit significantly from
   an intensive dialogue with engineers in order to find out about
   practical problems and conditions existing in wastewater treatment
   systems. In this paper, an attempt is made to help bridge the gap
   between science and engineering in biological wastewater treatment. We
   provide an overview of recently developed methods in microbiology and in
   mathematical modeling and numerical simulation. A questionnaire is
   presented which may help generate a platform from which further
   technical and scientific developments can be accomplished. Both the
   paper and the questionnaire are aimed at encouraging scientists and
   engineers to enter into an intensive, mutually beneficial dialogue. (C)

Abstract = {{An aerobic membrane bioreactor treating municipal wastewater at complete
   biomass retention was studied in respect of microbiological parameters
   over a period of 380 days. The results were compared to those obtained
   from a conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)
   treating the same wastewater. Microscopically, significant changes in
   the structure of the flocs and of the ratio between free suspended and
   aggregated cells could be observed. The presence of filamentous bacteria
   varied from almost not present to very high numbers. With the exception
   of short periods after changes in operating conditions, protozoa and
   metazoa were rarely present in the sludge community. The rate of oxygen
   consumption and the cell delectability by fluorescence in situ
   hybridization (FISH) with rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes were used
   to assess the physiological state of the bacterial cells. Oxygen
   consumption rates of sludge samples obtained from both the conventional
   and membrane filtration plant were determined without and after addition
   of different energy and carbon sources. In contrast to the conventional
   activated sludge, a pronounced increase in respiration activity upon the
   addition of organic substrates could be observed in the membrane
   filtration sludge. In situ probing with the Bacteria-specific probe
   EUB338 visualized 40-50\% of all DAPI-stainable bacteria in the membrane
   bioreactor, compared to 80\% cells detectable by FISH in the
   conventional activated sludge. These results suggest that bacteria
   present in the highly concentrated biomass of the membrane reactor used
   the energy supplied for their maintenance metabolism and were not in a
   physiological state characteristic for growth. This assumption could
   explain the zero net biomass production observed in the reactor. (C)

Abstract = {{To investigate the characteristics and the microbial diversity of
   denitrifying phosphate-accumulating organisms (DNPAOs) that are capable
   of conducting enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) using
   nitrate as electron acceptor, three sequencing batch reactors were
   operated under three different electron acceptor conditions, i.e., only
   oxygen, oxygen together with nitrate and only nitrate. Based on the
   chemical analysis concerning the biochemical transformation of each
   reactor, it was found that phosphate-accumulating organisms responsible
   for EBPR consisted of at least three populations including DNPAOs, and
   that the microbial community structure was changed according to the
   electron acceptor conditions. Also, the sludge cultivated with oxygen
   together with nitrate showed a drastic increase in the amount of
   phosphorus uptake under anoxic conditions, which suggested that a
   proportion of DNPAOs capable of utilizing nitrate under aerobic
   conditions were present.
   On the other hand, the change in microbial community structure depending
   on the type of electron acceptor was demonstrated by the analysis of the
   results of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of polymerase chain
   reaction-amplified 16S ribosomal DNA fragments. It was found that the
   bacteria commonly contained in all the reactors were Rhodocyclus sp.
   (96\% identity) and Dechlorimonas sp. (97\% identity) that belonged to
   the beta subclass of Proteobacteria, on the basis of the analysis of the
   sequence excised from DGGE bands and the determination of phylogenetic
   affiliation. However, only the presence of Rhodocyclus sp. in all the
   reactors was demonstrated by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis.

Abstract = {{Aerobic treatment of municipal waste water in a membrane bioreactor was
   studied for 535 d. Apart from sampling, sludge was retained completely
   by a submerged hollow fibre membrane with a pore-size of 0.2 mum. The
   pilot plant comprised an anoxic zone to enable denitrification. The
   maximum liquid hold-up of the plant was 3.9 m(3). In this study the
   reactor performance and the stability of the process and the membrane
   capacity were investigated. A stable flux of 181m(-2) h(-1) could be
   realised with a mean transmembrane pressure difference of 0.3 bar with
   air-bubbling and backflushing the membrane and cleaning it in place
   every two months for one or two hours. For about 140 d, a flux of
   271m(-2) h(-1) was achieved, but cleaning became necessary more often.
   The hydraulic retention time (HRT) varied between 10.4 and 15.6h.
   Accordingly the volumetric loading rate was between 1.1 and 1.7kg
   CODm(-3)d(-1). No inoculum was used. The mixed liquor suspended solids
   (MLSS) concentration gradually increased to 18-20 g MLSSI-1. The feed to
   microorganism (F/M) ratio varied according to the operation conditions
   but decreased against a value of 0.07 kg COD kg(-1) MLSS d(-1).
   Treatment performance was very stable and on a high level. The COD was
   reduced by 95\%. Nitrification was complete and up to 82\% of the total
   nitrogen could be denitrified. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Microautoradiography was used to enumerate bacteria able to take up
   radiolabelled acetate in activated sludge using oxygen or nitrate as
   electron acceptors. In each of three wastewater treatment plants (WWTP)
   with nitrification and denitrification (N-removal), the number of
   bacteria consuming acetate under aerobic and anoxic conditions was
   identical in contrast to the acetate removal rates. The rates were
   clearly lower under anoxic conditions suggesting that the specific
   activity of the cells and not the number of active cells was reduced
   under anoxic conditions. The fraction of bacteria able to consume
   acetate varied in three WWTPs between 47\% and 93\% of the total number
   of bacteria as determined by DAPI. In a WWTP without N-removal only 20\%
   of the bacteria were able to consume acetate under aerobic conditions
   and very few of these were able to do it under anoxic conditions. The
   cell specific acetate removal rates in all WWTPs were found to be
   3.0-13.2 x 10(-15) mol cell(-1) h(-1) under aerobic conditions and

Abstract = {{Microbial community structure of a lab scale thermophilic aerobic
   wastewater treatment reactor was analyzed by a combination of
   culture-independent methods. Quinone profile method provides for
   chemical analysis of respiratory quinone molecular species, which
   corresponds to bacterial groups. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
   (DGGE) of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA partial sequences (PCR-DGGE) clarifies
   community changes at species level, as DGGE can separate DNA fragments
   of different sequences. Certain phylogenetic groups of bacterial cells
   can be labeled by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Quinone
   profile showed a predominant presence of MK-7. PCR-DGGE revealed that
   constituents of the community were unchanged during the stable phase.
   FISH demonstrated the existence of the relatives of Bacillus lentus and
   B. thermocloacae in considerable proportions. The community was mainly
   composed of Bacillaceae, and obligate thermophilic and mesophilic
   Bacillus appeared in spite of the temperature fluctuation from
   35degreesC to 60degreesC. The combination of these culture-independent
   methods revealed the community precisely enough to evaluate the reactor

Abstract = {{The engineering and technology of the activated sludge system are
   reasonably well established, with systems implemented worldwide for the
   biological removal of C, N and/or P. Parallel to this development,
   significant advances have been made in the microbiological and
   biochemical areas of activated sludge, These advances have been driven
   by the development of new analytical techniques that allow
   microorganisms to be studied in situ in the activated sludge
   environment. However, there has been little cross-linking and overlap
   between the engineering and technology and microbiology and biochemistry
   paradigms. In particular, the information from the microbiology and
   biochemistry has not been integrated into the engineering and technology
   paradigm, to enable improved system design and optimization. One area
   that can form a starting point to build bridges between the two paradigm
   sets, is measurement of active biomass. The current design and
   simulation models invariably include active biomass for each organism
   group as fundamental parameters which define quantitatively the kinetic
   rates of the relevant biological processes. However, these parameters
   remain purely hypothetical because to date they have not been
   quantitatively measured; their acceptance is based on the consistency of
   model predicted results over a wide range of application. This paper
   describes developments in quantitative measurement of the heterotrophic
   and autotrophic active biomass concentrations within the engineering and
   technology paradigm, and the formulation of a multinational project
   which will attempt to link these measurements and the defined
   engineering environment to the new microbiological and biochemical
   analytical techniques. It is hoped that this project will facilitate
   integration of the two paradigms sets. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Pages = {{445-459}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The relationship between the levels of mycolic acid-containing
   actinomycetes (mycolata), Gordonia spp. and Gordonia amarae, and foam
   initiation and stability was characterized using: (1) batch tests
   involving addition of G. amarae cells to activated sludge, (2) analysis
   of a full-scale activated sludge plant that experienced seasonal
   foaming, and (3) a study of lab-scale activated sludge reactors
   augmented with G. amarae. Using batch tests, threshold Gordonia levels
   for foam formation and foam stability were determined to be
   approximately 2 x 10(8) mum ml(-1) and 1 x 10(9) mum ml(-1),
   respectively. In the full-scale plant, the levels of Gordonia spp. and
   G. amarae increased during the course of foaming, and the foam formation
   threshold of 2 x 10(8) mum ml(-1) corresponded to the onset of foaming.
   This value was also verified in lab-scale reactor washout experiments,
   where decreasing mycolata levels were observed during the course of foam
   dissipation. The foam stability threshold of 1 x 10(9) mum ml(-1) was
   verified in lab-scale reactor studies. The increase in the levels of
   Gordonia spp. and G. amarae in the full-scale plant corresponded to an
   increase in temperature, suggesting that the growth of Gordonia spp. was
   favored during warmer periods. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to evaluate the applicability of fluorescent
   dyes and multiparameter flow cytometry for the rapid and direct
   viability/activity assessment of activated sludge samples taken from
   wastewater treatment plants. Viability and activity of the biomass were
   estimated respectively through cellular membrane integrity, staining
   with SYBR Green I and Propidium Iodide, and through fluorogenic dyes
   capable of detecting enzymatic activity, as FDA and BCECF-AM. A
   procedure has been developed to disaggregate sludge flocs before dyes
   staining and cytometric analysis. The developed procedure allows a high
   recovery of bacteria with good accuracy and repeatability, and minimize
   the damage of the cells suspension obtained from the disaggregation of
   the flocs. These measurements were applied to estimate the two main
   parameters required to define the biological activated sludge process:
   the endogenous decay rate and the specific growth rate in exponential
   phase with high F/M ratio. Oxygen utilization rate measurements (OUR)
   were conducted to conventionally monitor the activity of the biomass.
   The preliminary data are encouraging and support the possibility to
   investigate bacteria dynamics on wastewater treatment plants. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Two biofilm reactors operated with hydraulic retention times of 0.8 and
   5.0 h were used to study the links between population dynamics and
   reactor operation performance during a shift in process operation from
   pure nitrification to combined nitrification and organic carbon removal.
   The ammonium and the organic carbon loads were identical for both
   reactors. The composition and dynamics of the microbial consortia were
   quantified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with
   rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes combined with confocal laser
   scanning microscopy, and digital image analysis. In contrast to past
   research, after addition of acetate as organic carbon nitrification
   performance decreased more drastically in the reactor with longer
   hydraulic retention time. FISH analysis showed that this effect was
   caused by the unexpected formation of a heterotrophic microorganism
   layer on top of the nitrifying biofilm that limited nitrifiers oxygen
   supply. Our results demonstrate that extension of the hydraulic
   retention time might be insufficient to improve combined nitrification
   and organic carbon removal in biofilm reactors. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The activated sludge comprises a complex microbiological community. The
   structure (what types of microorganisms are present) and function (what
   can the organisms do and at what rates) of this community are determined
   by external physico -chemical features and by the influent to the sewage
   treatment plant. The external features we can manipulate but rarely the
   influent. Conventional control and operational strategies optimise
   activated sludge processes more as a chemical system than as a
   biological one. While optimising the process in a short time period,
   these strategies may deteriorate the long-term performance of the
   process due to their potentially adverse impact on the microbial
   properties. Through briefly reviewing the evidence available in the
   literature that plant design and operation affect both the structure and
   function of the microbial community in activated sludge, we propose to
   add sludge population optimisation as a new dimension to the control of
   biological wastewater treatment systems. We stress that optimising the
   microbial community structure and property should be an explicit aim for
   the design and operation of a treatment plant. The major limitations to
   sludge population optimisation revolve around inadequate microbiological
   data, specifically community structure, function and kinetic data.
   However, molecular microbiological methods that strive to provide that
   data are being developed rapidly. The combination of these methods with
   the conventional approaches for kinetic study is briefly discussed. The
   most pressing research questions pertaining to sludge population
   optimisation are outlined. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Induction of denitrification was investigated for a lab-scale phosphate
   removing biofilm reactor where oxygen was replaced with nitrate as the
   electron acceptor. Acetate was used as the carbon source. The original
   biofilm. (acclimatised with oxygen) was taken from a well-established
   large-scale reactor. During the first run, a decrease in the
   denitrifying bio-P activity was observed after I month following a
   change in the anaerobic phase length. This was initially interpreted as
   a shift in the microbial population caused by the changed operation. In
   the second run, biomass samples were regularly collected and analysed by
   fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) and confocal laser scanning
   microscopy (CLSM). Concurrently, samples were taken from the original
   reactor with oxygen as electron acceptor in order to investigate natural
   microbial fluctuations. A similar decrease in the activity as in the
   first run was seen after one month, although the phase lengths had not
   been varied. Hence, the decrease after I month in the first and second
   run should be seen as a start-up phenomenon. FISH could detect a
   noticeable shift in the microbial population mainly within the first 2
   weeks of operation. Almost all bacteria belonging to the alpha subclass
   disappeared and characteristic clusters of the beta and gamma subclasses
   were lost. Small clusters of gram-positive bacteria with a high DNA G +
   C content (GPBHGC) were gradually replaced by filamentous GPBHGC. Most
   of the bacteria in the denitrifying, phosphate removing biofilm belonged
   to the beta subclass of Proteobacteria. The applied set of gene probes
   had been selected based on existing literature on biological phosphate
   removing organisms and included a recently published probe for a
   Rhodocyclus-like clone. However, none of the specific probes hybridised
   to the dominant bacterial groups in the reactors investigated. No
   noticeable changes were detected in the aerobic bench-scale reactor
   during this period, indicating that the observed changes in the
   lab-scale reactor were caused by the changed environment. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{A sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR) with well established enhanced
   biological phosphate removal (EBPR) was subjected to higher ammonium
   concentrations to stimulate and eventually implement simultaneous
   nitrification. Changes of activity and populations were investigated by
   a combination of online monitoring, microsensor measurements and
   fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) of biofilm sections.
   Nitrification and nitrifying bacteria were always restricted to the
   periodically oxic biofilm surface. Both, activity and population size
   increased significantly with higher ammonium concentrations.
   Nitrification always showed a delay after the onset of aeration, most
   likely due to competition for oxygen by coexisting P accumulating and
   other heterotrophic bacteria during the initial aeration phase. This
   view is also supported by comparing oxygen penetration and oxygen uptake
   rates under low and high ammonium conditions. Therefore, simultaneous
   nitrification and phosphorus removal in a P removing SBBR appears to be
   only possible with a sufficiently long oxic period to ensure oxygen
   availability for nitrifiers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights
