Abstract = {{The main objective of this study was to investigate the inactivation
   kinetics of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts with sequential disinfection
   schemes involving ozone as a primary disinfectant, and free chlorine or
   monochloramine as a secondary disinfectant. Two types of synergistic
   effects were observed. Ozone pre-treatment resulted in the removal of
   the relatively more pronounced initial lag phases observed for
   monochloramine and hypochlorous acid. An additional and more important
   synergistic effect was an enhancement in the rate of secondary
   inactivation with both hypochlorous acid and monochloramine after
   complete removal of the lag phase by ozone pretreatment. A stronger
   synergy was observed at a lower temperature. The secondary inactivation
   rate was 1.1-2.8 (hypochlorous acid) and 2.4-9.2 (monochloramine) times
   faster than the corresponding post lag-phase primary inactivation rate
   at respective temperatures of 30-10 degreesC. Consistency between the
   two viability assessment methods, modified in-vitro excystation and
   animal infectivity, was demonstrated or shown for both primary
   inactivation with ozone and secondary inactivation with
   ozone/monochloramine. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The feasibility of a PAH- and phenol-degrading microorganism
   (Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17484) to degrade carbazole was investigated.
   While the culture could not utilize carbazole as a sole carbon and
   energy source, carbazole could be completely degraded in the presence of
   200 mg/l sodium salicylate. It was found that there was a trace
   accumulation of autopolymerization products resulting from the
   degradation of sodium salicylate at the end of the experiments. Based on
   mass-spectrometric analysis, the identities of these products were
   proposed as a dimer of catechol and its derivative. Cell growth and
   degradation kinetics models were developed and experimentally validated
   over a wide range of concentrations of sodium salicylate (50-600 mg/l)
   and carbazole (0.5-4.5 mg/l). Cells grew on sodium salicylate based on
   Haldane kinetics with parameters of mu (ml) = 0.520 h(-1), K-S1 = 36.2
   mg/l and K-II = 1201.7 mg/l. while carbazole exerted toxicity inhibition
   to growth. When both carbazole and sodium salicylate were present, ATCC
   17484 utilized them simultaneously but with lower specific rates. Model
   analysis indicates that carbazole inhibited sodium salicylate
   degradation more than the self-inhibition of sodium salicylate. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The mesh filtration bio-reactor (MFBR) was equipped with a nylon mesh as
   filter material instead of a microfiltration membrane in a membrane
   bio-reactor. Laboratory scale MFBRs were used for the experiments. We
   have observed that a mesh having a pore size of 100 mum effectively
   rejected activated sludge and that the reactor retained SS of up to 9000
   mg.l(-1) with a flux of 0.5-0.76 m.day(-1) at very low pressure (5-10
   mm-H2O). The study also revealed that the sludge layer formed at the
   mesh surface plays an essential role in separating activated sludge.
   The synthetic wastewater (BOD:200 mg.l(-1), T-N:50 mg.l(-1). T-P:5.7
   mg.l(-1)) was fed to the reactor under the following conditions: HRT of
   4-8 h, continuous feeding, continuous filtration, and continuous or
   intermittent aeration. Under these conditions, SS and BOD of the
   effluent were less than 1.5 mg.l(-1) and 5.0 mg.l(-1), respectively.
   Under intermittent aeration conditions T-N removal attained 80 \%,
   although the mesh filter was clogged in 1-2 weeks. In addition, when the
   filtration bio-reactor was applied to an A2O process, effective T-N
   removal was obtained without clogging of the mesh filter for 2 months.
   These results show that a MFBR can be of use as an alternative advanced
   wastewater treatment system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The authors discuss the reliability of a new method used to depict
   precisely the authigenic calcite precipitation process in the water
   column of a mesotrophic alpine lake (Lake Bourget, Savoie, France).
   Complete chemical analysis of dissolved major elements shows that, in
   the epilimnion, calcium concentration and alkalinity are the only
   chemical species presenting large variations. The behaviour of these two
   parameters is only related to calcite precipitation. The method is based
   on in situ specific conductance measurements (C-25). Experimental values
   were compared with theoretical calculations. The results demonstrate
   clearly that dissolved calcium concentration can be directly related to
   measured specific conductance. Hence, a mathematical relationship was
   developed to compute calcium concentration profiles in the water column
   with a centimetre spatial resolution through the whole water column.
   Finally, authigenic calcite production can be observed and quantified on
   a time scale covering two years or experimental data. Calcite production
   is estimated to 4.8 mol m(-2) yr(-1). Extrapolation to the whole lake
   surface leads to 16.000 +/- 2000 tons yr(-1) as CaCO3. specific
   conductance is an easy-to-measure in situ parameter which could be used
   to trace authigenic calcite production in other hard water alpine lakes.

Abstract = {{Studies of the anaerobic biodegradation of mixtures of tetrachloroethene
   (PCE) and carbon tetrachloride (CT) were performed in a ? m long
   sand-filled column that was initially biodegrading PCE in the absence of
   CT. CT added to the column was rapidly biodegraded to chloroform (CF).
   When concentrations of CT were increased from 3.3 muM, to 6.6 muM, and
   finally to 13 muM the corresponding CF concentrations were 1.2, 2.3, and
   3.0 muM. respectively. Dichloromethane (DCM) production also increased
   as CT concentrations were increased, but all DCM was biodegraded.
   Biodegradation of PCE was initially completely inhibited on exposure of
   the column to 3.3 muM CT, but within 24 days PCE biodegradation had
   restarted, reaching a peak recovery after 34 days. Subsequent doubling
   of CT inlet concentrations to 6.6 muM (2.3 muM CF) produced only partial
   inhibition of PCE biodegradation and recovery was faster than observed
   with the initial addition of CT. Further doubling of CT concentrations
   to 13 muM (3.0 muM CF) produced an even shorter period of elevated
   inhibition of PCE biodegradation. The ultimate rate and extent of PCE
   biodegradation were reduced however, indicating an increased inhibition
   of PCE biodegradation at 3.0 muM CF compared to 2.3 muM CF. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{A tertiary treatment scheme involving simultaneous operation of
   activated carbon adsorption and advanced oxidation with ultraviolet
   light and hydrogen peroxide, followed by ``destructive regeneration{''}
   of the spent adsorbent by advanced oxidation was investigated, using
   phenol as a model compound. Operational parameters in each step were
   optimized on the basis of phenol and total organic carbon removal during
   selected contact times. It was found that in the first stage with
   adsorption/advanced oxidation, phenol was totally eliminated during the
   first quarter of the contact time, and 87.5\% total organic carbon
   removal was accomplished at the end. It was further found that advanced
   oxidation was the dominant pathway in this operation for the
   disappearance of phenol, while that of total organic carbon was carried
   out by combined effects of adsorption and oxidative degradation. Optimum
   regenerating frequency for the spent activated carbon was found to be
   once every four batches, which was four times slower than the required
   frequency in the absence of advanced oxidation. In the second part of
   the operation, where the spent carbon was regenerated destructively via
   advanced oxidation, 92.5\% mineralization was accomplished in the
   regenerating solution at the end of the optimized contact Lime. The
   economic assessment of the system considering the operation of both
   steps revealed that under the initial and optimized conditions, the
   operating cost is 2.26 USD per cubic meter of wastewater with 40 ppm
   phenol. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reactive dyes have been identified as problematic compounds in textile
   wastewaters as they are water soluble and cannot be easily removed by
   conventional aerobic biological wastewater treatment systems. Anaerobic
   systems could reduce the color intensity more satisfactorily than the
   aerobic processes. However, the intermediate products are carcinogenic
   aromatic amines which need to be further decomposed by an aerobic
   treatment. An anaerobic/aerobic SBR system was used to treat a synthetic
   dye wastewater with glucose and acetic acid (1000 mg/l GOD) as carbon
   sources, together with 20 mg/l of four different reactive dyes; i.e.,
   bisazo vinylsulphonyl, anthraquinone vinylsulphonyl, anthraquinone
   monochlorotriazinyl and oxazine. The color reduction of the first three
   dyes was 63, 64 and 66\%, respectively. The decolorization efficiency of
   the last or oxazine dye was not determined because of a strange
   phenomenon or re-appearance of the color when samples were disturbed.
   More color removal was achieved in the anaerobic phase than in the
   aerobic step. The initial decolorization rate was 11.9, 0.37 and 0.48
   SU/h for the first three dyes, respectively. Though the system comprised
   anaerobic and aerobic tanks, the color reduction did not rely on
   phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs). High temperature and
   photo-oxidation through exposure to sunlight could increase the
   decolorization rate, and the decolorization was not possible if viable
   organisms were not present in the system. Nitrate. when present, could
   interfere with the color reduction while sulfate did not. The bisazo
   reactive dye was decolorized by the reductive reaction, which resulted
   in the cleavage of the azo bond. Meanwhile, the decolorization of
   anthraquinone dyes was through the adsorption of dyes on Roc materials.

Abstract = {{Activated sludge treatment is used to remove wastewater organic matter
   (OM) and residual OM is found at low levels in treated water. The
   molecular composition of OM of waters and sludge was determined In order
   to understand the fate of the organic substances during biological
   treatment and the nature of residual OM. Proteins, sugars, lipids and
   polyphenolic compounds were quantified in a municipal wastewater
   treatment plant via chromatographic analysis after chemical hydrolysis.
   The concentration of OM was decreased by more than 90\% by biological
   treatment. However, if 63\% of the OM were characterized in activated
   sludge, molecular analysis did not allow us to characterize all the OM
   in the water samples. Relatively higher amounts of total organic carbon
   (TOC) were identified in wastewater (50\%) than in treated water (20\%).
   Likewise, for total nitrogen, 33\% were identified as amino acid
   nitrogen in wastewater, and only 10\% in treated water. Analytical
   pyrolysis suggested that some of the difficulties in identifying OM of
   treated water with common analytical methods are due to the presence of
   complex structures, refractory to hydrolysis. These structures may also
   be refractory to microbial degradation since they are concentrated
   during the biological treatment of wastewater. Suggestions on the
   possible origin and structure of resistant OM were formulated according
   to the analytical results. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the past, a series of epidemiological studies have been conducted
   with the aim of establishing a relationship between the concentration of
   faecal indicators and the number of bathing related illnesses. The final
   goal was to find a level of faecal indicators which could be considered
   acceptable under the point of view of the risk of infection. Because
   epidemiological studies are costly, additional means of obtaining
   health-related standards are desirable, which are easier to carry out
   and more affordable than epidemiological studies. In this paper. we have
   made an attempt to develop such an alternative. Setting out from
   published data on the dose response relationship for rotaviruses in
   humans, and from the lognormal distribution of faecal indicators assumed
   to exist in surface waters, we have established a series of equations
   which link the concentration of faecal indicators with the risk of
   infection. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The anaerobic degradability and inhibitory effects of linoleic acid, an
   18 carbon acid with two double bonds (C18:2) commonly found in vegetable
   oils, were examined at 21 degreesC. Linoleic acid was anaerobically
   degraded to unsaturated and saturated products. Unsaturated oleic
   (C18:1) and palmitoleic (C16:1) acids were transiently formed while
   saturated palmitic (C16:0) and myristic (C14:0) acids were
   stoichiometrically produced and may have inhibited their own subsequent
   degradation. Ultimately, all detected byproducts, including lauric
   (C12:0) and hexanoic (C6:0) acids, were degraded with the exception of
   acetic acid which accumulated. Linoleic acid at concentrations of 30 mg
   l(-1) or more completely inhibited aceticlastic methanogenesis. Although
   hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was slightly inhibited by 30 mg l(-1) of
   linoieic acid or more, hydrogen consumption remained robust. Anaerobic
   systems to treat wastewaters with linoleic acid-containing vegetable
   oils may require two separate stages to minimize the inhibition of
   aceticlastic methanogens by linoleic acid. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Biofilm protein removal by a variety of chemical treatments was
   investigated. Binary population biofilms of P. aeruginosa and K.
   pneumoniae were grown in continuous flow annular reactors for 7-9 days
   prior to a 1-h treatment period. Treatments that caused removal of more
   than 25\% of the biomass (as total protein) included NaCl and CaCl2, two
   chelating agents (EDTA and Dequest 2006), surfactants (SDS, Tween 20,
   and Triton X-100), a pH increase, lysozyme, hypochlorite.
   monochloramine. and concentrated urea. Treatments that caused little
   removal (less than 25\%) included a control. MgCl2, sucrose, nutrient
   upshifts and downshifts, and a pH decrease. The amount of biofilm
   protein removal and the reduction in viable cell numbers in the biofilm
   were not correlated. Some treatments caused significant killing but not
   much removal while other treatments caused removal with little killing.
   These results underscore the fact that biofilm removal and killing are
   distinct processes. The chemical diversity of agents that bring about
   biofilm removal suggests that multiple interactive forces contribute to
   biofilm cohesion. No pattern of differential removal of the two
   microbial species could be discerned. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail

Abstract = {{The first part of the study investigated mercury (Hg) concentrations in
   freshwater fish collected from the Pearl River Delta and Hong Kong.
   Mercury concentrations observed in freshwater fish and fish pond
   sediments collected from the Pearl River Delta were 17.5-267 ng/g (dry
   wt) and 96 ng/g (dry wt)-1.67 mug/g (dry wt), respectively. As to
   samples collected from Hong Kong, Hg concentrations were 15.8-84.4 ng/g
   (dry wt) in fish flesh and 57-435 ng/g (dry wt) In sediments.
   Accumulation of Hg in fish was related to the spatial difference of Hp
   in sediment. Significant linear relationships were obtained for the
   concentrations of Hg in grass carp (r(2) = 0.51, n = 12), big head (r(2)
   = 0.97, n = 12) and tilapia (r(2) = 0.55, n = 24). The second part of
   the study investigated the dietary influence on the uptake of Hg by
   different fish species cultured in the wastewater treatment system at Au
   Tau Fisheries Station in Hong Kong. The effect of feeding habits of the
   six fish species in Hg accumulation was apparent. The highest levels of
   Hg were observed in black bass with the value of 56.7 ng/g (dry wt),
   moderately in big head (33.8 ng/g dry wt), grass carp (26.3 ng/g dry wt)
   and silver carp (20.8 ng/g dry wt), and the least in common carp (18.9
   ng/g dry wt) and tilapia (13.7 ng/g dry wt). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The removal of bromate, an inorganic disinfection by-product, by
   granular activated carbon (GAC) was investigated in this study. Bromate
   ion removal from water was observed in the presence of virgin and
   acid-washed outgassed (AWOG) GAG. In a GAC filter with
   distilled-deionized water, bromate breakthrough occurred slowly whereas
   bromate breakthrough occurred very quickly in natural water due to the
   presence of natural organic matter (NOM) and other anions. NOM
   adsorption decreased bromate reduction, presumably by blocking bromate
   reduction sites. The use of a biologically active carbon (BAC) tilter
   with ozonated water, as a pretreatment step to remove NOM. only slightly
   improved bromate reduction in the subsequent fresh GAC filter. Kinetic
   studies showed that the presence of chloride. sulfate. bromide, and
   nitrate causes a decrease in the kinetics of bromate reduction by GAG.
   These anions may occupy ion exchange sites on the carbon, reducing the
   rate at which bromate can access the reduction sites. However, when the
   anions were released from the carbon, the bromate reduction rate
   increased. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many human pathogenic micro-organisms can be transmitted by waters
   contaminated by wastewater effluents. Wastewater disinfection helps
   prevent the spread of these pathogens in aquatic environments.
   Chlorination is the most widely used method for the disinfection of
   wastewater, but can cause the formation of mutagenic/carcinogenic and
   toxic by-products which are potentially harmful to human and aquatic
   organisms.
   The aim of this research was to study the influence of disinfectants
   alternative to chlorine, such as chlorine dioxide, ozone, peracetic acid
   and UV radiation, on the formation of mutagenic and toxic compounds in
   wastewater. Wastewater samples were collected before and after
   disinfection in summer and in winter and then adsorbed using silica C-18
   cartridges. Concentrates were tested For mutagenicity using the Ames
   rest. For toxicity test, a bioluminescence assay using Vibrio fischeri
   photobacteria was employed. To detect DNA damage activity
   non-concentrated water samples were tested using two genotoxicity plant
   tests (Allium test and Tradescantia/micronuclei test). All disinfectant
   treatments produced bacterial mutagenicity, particularly after treatment
   with ClO2 or ozone. The Allium cepa test gave positive results only for
   PAA-treated wastewater sampled in winter and the Tradescantia/MCN test
   always gave negative results. Raw wastewater, ClO2- and PAA-disinfected
   waters showed toxic effects in the marine bacteria test. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Six different species of non-living Sargassum biomass were compared on
   the basis of their equilibrium Cd and Cu uptake in order to evaluate
   potential variability in the sorption performance of different Sargassum
   species. Biosorption uptakes for Cd at the optimal pH of 4.5 ranged from
   q(max) = 0.90 mmol/g for Sargassum sp. 1 to 0.66 mmol/g for S.
   filipendula I representing a 36\% difference. Three species were
   evaluated for their Cu uptake where q(max) = 0.93 mmol/g for S. vulgare;
   0.89 mmol/g for S. filipendula I, and 0.80 for S. fluitans, representing
   a 16\% difference between the lowest and highest values. Potentiometric
   titrations were carried out on S. vulgare, S. fluitans and S.
   filipendula I and yielded the similar results of 1.5 mmol/g weakly
   acidic sites for S. vulgare and S. fluitans, and 1.6 mmol/g for S.
   filipendula I. Estimates of 0.3 mmol/g of strongly acidic sites for S.
   fluitans and S. filipendula I and 0.5 mmol/g for S. vulgare were
   obtained. The total number of active sites averaged 1.9 +/- 0.1 mmol/g.
   The elution efficiency for Cu-desorption from S. filipendula was
   determined for CaCl2, Ca(NO3)(2), and HCl at various concentrations and
   solid:liquid ratios (S/L). The highest elution efficiency was >95\% for
   Cu for all elutants at S/L = 1 g/l and decreased for both calcium salts
   with increasing S/L to less than 50\% at S/L = 10 g/l as a new batch
   sorption equilibrium was reached quickly. CaCl2 was chosen to be the
   most suitable metal-cation desorbing agent. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A feasibility study for oxidation of printed circuit board wastes with
   NaOH in supercritical water has been investigated. Experimentally, Sr
   species in the printed circuit board resin was abstracted by sodium
   cations and the destruction efficiency of the waste was enhanced in the
   supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) process. By X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   spectroscopy, Cu2O, CuO, and Cu(OH)(2) were found in the SWCO solid
   residue of the printed circuit board wastes. The extended X-ray
   absorption fine structural (EXAFS) spectra indicated that the bond
   distance of Cu-O in the residue was 1.87 Angstrom with a coordination
   number of 2.61. Since the Cu-Br species was not observed by XRD and
   EXAFS spectroscopies, one may eliminate the possibility that the copper
   was involved in the abstraction of bromine species from the resin matrix
   in the SCWO process. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The low temperature of the snowmelt water in the spring seems to affect
   the biofiltration of wastewaters: biofilters clog rapidly during the
   critical period of March and April. This study presents the results of
   biochemical tests carried out in wash-water (biomass) of a Biodrof-type
   biofilter. These tests deal with the measurement of hydrolase,
   dehydrogenase (DI-IA) and total polysaccharides (TP). The wash-water
   analyses showed ratios of 41\% total polysaccharides over VSS (w/w)
   during the cold period. corresponding to influent temperatures of
   7.5-13.5 degreesC. During the warmer period (15.0-18.01 degreesC), this
   ratio is 26\%. Observations of the biomass show an abundance of fixed
   ciliated protozoans during the cold period. being replaced by a
   bacterial and fungal biofilm during the warmer period. Moreover. during
   the cold period, the biomass contains less extra-cellular enzyme like
   beta -glucosidase type, but the ratio of active biomass measured using
   the dehydrogenase glucose (DHA) is the same for all temperature ranges
   measured here. This implies that weak hydrolytic activity. coupled with
   accumulation of a biofilm and inert particles of the influent encourages
   a rapid clogging of the biofilter. The loads in GOD, and SS as well as
   the filtration rates have but little effect on the premature clogging of
   the biofilter under spring conditions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The adsorption of reactive dyes on shale oil ash has been investigated
   during a series of batch adsorption experiments. The adsorption isotherm
   data were fitted to Langmuir isotherm. The two-resistance mass transfer
   model has been developed based on the film resistance and homogeneous
   solid phase diffusion.
   A computer program has been developed to estimate the theoretical
   concentration-lime dependent curves and to compare them with the
   experimental curves by means of the best-fit approach. The model
   predicts that the external mass transfer coefficient K was not affected
   by varying the initial dye concentration, but it increases when the
   agitation speed and temperature was raised. The diffusion coefficient D
   was Found to increase when the initial dye concentration, and
   temperature was raised. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail rights

Abstract = {{The occurrence of arsenic in natural water has received significant
   attention during recent years. Arsenic exists in the environment in a
   number of valency states. The valency state of arsenic plays an
   important role for its behavior and toxicity in the aqueous system. The
   toxicity and bioavailability of arsenic can only be determined if all
   its forms can be identified and quantified. Therefore, the aim of this
   article is to provide a general description of the occurrence of arsenic
   in the environment, its toxicity, health hazards, and measurement
   techniques for speciation analysis. Different techniques used for
   speciation of arsenic. viz.. spectrometric. chromatographic.
   electrochemical. etc. have been discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Syringaldehyde (4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde) was chlorinated in
   the laboratory at different reaction rime. temperature, pH and chlorine
   dose, and MX was determined and quantified by GC/MS. The finding
   suggests that the optimal chlorination conditions are as follows:
   temperature=298 K. pH=5, Cl:syrin. (mol:mol)=9:1. We also found that the
   formation of MX increased with the syringaldehyde concentration in a
   linear relationship. In addition, when syringaldehyde was chlorinated
   with a different chlorine dose in an alkaline condition, no MX was
   detected. This study Will conduce to elucidating the kinetic process For
   the formation of MX from syringaldehyde and will be of great help for
   better control of MX in drinking water. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The drying of residual sludge is a current environmental problem not
   well described in scientific literature. Thus research investigations on
   this dewatering process are necessary according to the industrial
   demand. This paper proposes, from laboratory convective drying
   experiments, a macroscopic approach in terms of kinetics curve and
   drying potential. This criterion which groups a set of external
   conditions into an unique parameter (T, RH, v) allows an easy
   classification of different operating strategies-then it can be the
   first step for design investigations. Moreover this study allowed us to
   compare the behaviour of tao very different kinds of sludge. It also
   described a crust phenomenon in the case of activated sludge and a large
   permeability of the PVC drying cake according to water transport. (C)

Abstract = {{A continuous-flow stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and a soil
   slurry-sequencing batch reactor (SS-SBR) were maintained in 81 vessels
   for 180 days to treat a diesel fuel-contaminated soil. The SS-SBR
   provided markedly enhanced contaminant degradation relative to the CSTR.
   Diesel fuel removal efticiency was 96\% in the SS-SBR, compared with
   75\% in the CSTR. Microbial growth was approximately 25\% greater in the
   SS-SBR than the CSTR. However, significant biosurfactant production and
   foaming occurred in the SS-SBR, whereas none was observed in the CSTR.
   Surfactants were produced in the SS-SBR at concentrations up to 70 times
   the critical micelle concentration (CMC), but were biodegraded by the
   end of the cycle. Reactor operation was reversed after 80 days. The
   reactor converted from an SS-SBR to a CSTR lost surfactant production
   and showed reduced diesel fuel degradation. Converting the CSTR to an
   SS-SBR resulted in surfactant production and enhanced diesel fuel
   degradation. These results indicate that fill-and-draw operation
   selected for microbes with a greater ability to produce surfactants and
   degrade diesel fuel than the CSTR operation. Decreasing the diesel fuel
   addition rate in the SS-SBR by four times on day 160 reduced the maximum
   surfactant concentration and foam thickness by more than three times
   without affecting diesel fuel removal. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{New methods for the determination of reactive bromine and chlorine
   species are presented. Hypobromous acid (HOBr) and all three bromamines
   species (NH2Br, NHBr2, NBr3) are analyzed as a sum parameter and
   hypochlorous acid (HOCl), monochloramine (NH2Cl) and chlorine dioxide
   (ClO2) can be determined selectively. However, no distinction is
   possible between HOCl and the active bromine species. The bromine and
   chlorine species react with ABTS
   (2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid-diammonium salt)
   to a green colored product that is measured at 405 or 728 nm. Free
   chlorine and NH2Cl can be measured in the presence of ozone. The method
   is therefore suitable if combinations of disinfectants are used, such as
   chlorine/chlorine dioxide or chlorine/ozone. In natural waters, the
   method provides a detection limit for all chlorine/bromine species of
   less than 0.1 muM. The colored reaction product is very stable and
   allows a fixation of the chlorine/bromine species in the field and
   subsequent determination of the absorption in the laboratory. (C) 2000

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Three activated carbons and two chars made from low rank coal were
   evaluated in terms of their ability to remove the organic compound
   4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and natural organic matter (NOM) from aqueous
   systems. The adsorption equilibrium capacities of all adsorbents for
   4-NP correlated with the micropore area of the adsorbents. Adsorption
   rates showed improved removal with decreasing particle size and higher
   carbon mass loadings. A pseudo first order model was used to fit the
   kinetic data, with a correlation coefficient of 0.995-0.999 for all
   systems.
   The adsorption capacity for NOM, as measured by UV-absorbing DOG,
   correlated well with the pore volume and pore surface areas for pores
   with diameters in the range 2.7-21 nm. The trend in the adsorption
   capacities and removal rates of the adsorbents for NOM provided evidence
   that the pore size distribution is one of the most important physical
   characteristics of activated carbon for the adsorption of NOM.
   The performance of activated low rank coal based materials was
   comparable to a high quality coconut-based commercial carbon in batch
   systems. Although the non-activated char adsorbents gave poor
   performance, they have potential for use in applications where poor
   performance can be outweighed by lower cost. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The feasibility of biologically removing methanol from kraft pulp mill
   evaporator condensate was investigated, using a high temperature
   membrane bioreactor (MBR). Over the range of temperatures investigated
   (55-70 degreesC), a mixed culture of methanol-utilizing microorganisms
   could be successfully developed, using synthetic condensate as a
   feedstock. A maximum specific methanol utilization coefficient of
   approximately 0.81 day(-1) occurred at an operating temperature of 60
   degreesC. Over 99\% of the methanol was removed from the condensate at
   operating temperatures of 55 and 60 degreesC. Above 60 degreesC, the
   specific methanol utilization coefficient declined sharply, indicating
   that at high operating temperatures, the inactivating effect of
   temperature on the mixed culture of microorganisms must be considered. A
   relatively simple model was proposed and used to estimate the effect of
   high temperatures on methanol removal kinetics in an MBR over the range
   of temperatures investigated. The operating temperature also had a
   significant effect on the observed growth yield. At increasing operating
   temperatures, a larger fraction of the methanol consumed was converted
   to energy, reducing the observed growth yield. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The possibility of predicting the time dependence of flux evolution for
   ultrafiltration systems is one of the most important factor that
   influences large-scale applications, optimization and automation,
   because flux affects productivity and thus all cost components. This
   paper presents the development and exploitation of mathematical models
   based on artificial neural networks, trained with experimental data
   obtained in a laboratory scale ultrafiltration system. Hollow-fibre
   ultrafiltration membranes and dead-end mode of operation were used for
   secondary refinery effluent treatment, at constant transmembrane
   pressure and fixed loss of the initial flux. For the training procedure
   of neural networks, ultrafiltration tests followed by backwashing with
   demineralized water, performed in the same operating conditions have
   been selected. Two neural network models were constructed to predict the
   flux at any time instant during ultrafiltration and after backwashing
   for arbitrary cycles, within the ultrafiltration-backwashing process.
   The trained networks are able to accurately capture the non-linear
   dynamics for initial fluxes in the range 80-145 I h(-1) m(-2) and for
   time horizons up to 2500 s. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Most wastewater treatment plants regularly monitor plant performance.
   Analysis of the resulting data can provide valuable insights into plant
   behaviour. A useful first step in the systematic analysis of such data
   is to depict them graphically. The resulting plots help identify the
   more obvious relationships between measured wastewater characteristics.
   They also help in locating anomalous data points. In the case of
   multi-pond wastewater treatment lagoons, finding an informative way of
   depicting the monitoring data is difficult. This is because the required
   data plots need to show not only how measured characteristics vary with
   time but also how they vary along the pond chain. Conventional 2-D
   ``time-series{''} plots are inadequate for this task if the lagoon
   comprises more than a few ponds, or if the amount of accumulated data is
   large. An alternative, contour plot based approach was developed that
   overcomes the problems with conventional 2-D plots. The procedure for
   producing such plots is described and factors affecting their accuracy
   discussed. A major advantage of the contour plot approach is that
   contour plots for different parameters can be superimposed. By examining
   these superimposed plots, one can learn much about the way different
   parameters are related. A procedure is described that enables the
   interrelatedness of any given pair of parameters to be systematically
   characterised. The effectiveness of the contour plot approach is
   illustrated using data obtained over a 9-year period for an 11 (later
   10) pond lagoon at the Western Treatment plant in Melbourne, Australia.

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{4389-4396}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the course of the present study the biological treatment of leachate
   from oil shale semicoke ash heaps in a wastewater lagoon was
   investigated. The lagooning process was simulated by laboratory-scale
   batch processes and a lagoon, by applying different aeration conditions
   at 20 degreesC.
   Treatment in the lagoon significantly reduced chemical oxygen demand
   (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and phenols in the leachate. A
   removal of 55-64\% of COD was achieved. The removal of phenols,
   estimated on the basis of identified phenolic compounds, was 80-88\%.
   The best removal of GOD, up to 70\%, was achieved in the intermittently
   aerated batch, while in the non-aerated batch the removal was 41\%. In
   the intermittently aerated batch the removals of phenol, methylphenols
   and dimethylphenols were on the average from 95 to over 99\%. All the
   tested systems showed lower removals of resorcinols compared to those of
   monohydric phenols.
   This study indicates that leachate from oil shale semicoke ash heaps
   could be treated in an aerated lagooning system, and that the biological
   treatment of the high pH leachate is feasible without pH adjustment. (C)

Abstract = {{The degradation of aniline by bacterial consortia was investigated under
   aerobic, fermentative, nitrate-reducing and sulphate-reducing conditions
   and a variety of salt concentrations (0.2, 4 and 7\% NaCl w/v) and pH
   values (5 and 7). A variety of degradation conditions were studied to
   provide information and recommendations for large-scale biological
   treatment of aniline-containing wastewater. Under aerobic conditions,
   degradation of aniline (2 mM) was achieved under all combinations of
   salinity and pH tested. The rate of bacterial growth decreased with
   increasing salinity. The bacterial consortium of each batch culture
   generally maintained its ability to degrade aniline when salt
   concentrations and pHs were changed although often the lag-phase prior
   to growth was extended. Microbial populations in tired film continuous
   reactors were also able to resist changes in NaCl concentration.
   Increasing aniline concentration (0.25-1 g l(-1)) under 0.2\% NaCl (pH 5
   and 7) conditions, resulted in aniline removal without affecting growth
   rates. At the lower pH, cell yield was not adversely affected by an
   increase in aniline concentration. However, at neutral pH, cell yield
   decreased with increasing aniline concentration. Cultures capable of
   degrading aniline under fermentative, nitrate-reducing and
   sulphate-reducing conditions were not obtained. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Studies on the reductive decolorization of a complex azo dye, Reactive
   Red 3.1, were made as part of the development of a practical approach to
   better exploit the metabolic potential of biomass in wastewater
   treatment. Decolorization was achieved at low and variable rates by
   mixed microbial cultures under various environmental conditions,
   including low pH and high salt concentration. It was caused by reductive
   cleavage of the azo bond to yield two aromatic amines. More reliable and
   effective decolorization rates, of up to 20-30 mg l(-1) h(-1), were
   given by unadapted activated sludge, (6 g l(-1)) incubated with 400 mg
   l(-1) of Reactive Red 3.1 under anaerobic conditions. Decolorization
   also occurred best in static conditions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The ozonation of metol, one of the main constituents of photographic
   developers, has been studied in aqueous solution in the pH range
   2.0-7.0. Main reaction mechanisms have been assessed on the basis of
   observed reaction intermediates and products at varying pH of the
   solution. The effect of manganese addition-Mn-II ions or solid MnO2-to
   the reacting system has also been evaluated.
   The capability of the ozonation treatment to reduce the toxicity of
   metol-containing aqueous solutions, with respect to selected organisms,
   such as algae, has also been studied according to reported standard
   procedures. The results of toxicological assessments show that high
   levels of detoxification are achieved after 20 min of ozonation
   treatment and that longer treatments cause an increase in the toxicity
   of the solution due to the formation of secondary reaction products. The
   adoption of proper chemical and fluid dynamic submodels enabled the
   estimation of the reaction kinetics of ozone that attack to the
   substrate. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sludge dewatering by dual polyelectrolytes conditioning was investigated
   in this study. Single polyelectrolyte is utilized in sludge conditioning
   conventionally, in which charge neutralization and bridging are involved
   in the reactions. In the current study, both cationic and non-ionic
   polyelectrolytes were utilized simultaneously in the conditioning. Waste
   activated sludge was sampled from a synthetic fiber plant, and used in
   the experiment. Capillary suction time (CST), specific resistance to
   filtration (SRF), and settling rate were used to evaluate the sludge
   dewatering behaviors. Zeta potentials were also measured. Sludge
   dewatering behaviors resulting from single and dual polyelectrolytes
   conditioning were compared. It was found that sludge conditioned with
   dual polyelectrolytes performed better in fine particle capture and in
   the formation of larger Aocs that resulted in a better dewaterability
   and less chance of overdosing. The dosing sequence in dual
   polyelectrolytes also affected the sludge dewaterability. Reaction
   mechanisms in dual polyelectrolyte conditioning were proposed based on
   enhanced flocculation of sludge particles. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Sequential reductive dechlorination of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene (HCBD)
   was achieved by a mixed, methanogenic culture enriched from a
   contaminated estuarine sediment. Both methanol and lactate served as
   carbon and electron sources. Methanol was stoichiometrically converted
   to methane, whereas lactate was fermented to propionate and acetate and
   then to methane. Lactate and propionate fermentation, as well as
   methanogenesis were not inhibited at 0.4 mg HCBD/l, the normal
   enrichment culture HCBD feeding level. At a higher initial HCBD level of
   1.5 mg HCBD/l, propionate fermentation and acetoclastic methanogenesis
   were inhibited while, after a lag time, enhanced HCBD dechlorination
   rates were observed. While lactate fermentation was not inhibited at
   high concentrations (>25 mM) of 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES), both
   propionate fermentation and methanogenesis were completely inhibited,
   although the HCBD dechlorination rate was not affected. Therefore,
   methanogens were not likely responsible for the observed dechlorination
   of HCBD in the enrichment culture. The predominant HCBD dechlorination
   products were isomers of tri- and dichloro-1,3-butadiene. Traces of a
   monochloro-1,3-butadiene isomer were also detected. Although extensive
   dechlorination of HCBD was achieved by the enrichment culture, the
   detoxification efficiency of this process remains unclear because the
   potential inhibitory effect of the HCBD transformation products is
   unknown. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation aimed
   at determining the impact of the type of pavement, whether conventional
   or porous, on the hydraulic behaviour and on the quality of runoff
   water. Data obtained from a French highway bath before and after the
   replacement of a conventional asphalt by a porous asphalt are compared.
   Statistical tests have been used to evaluate the significance of the
   differences detected. Firstly, the differences in hydrological behaviour
   between the two types of pavement is highlighted (retardant effect on
   the evacuation of water into the outlet, peak flow attenuation,
   mitigation of splashing by the pervious pavement). Secondly, the impact
   on water quality is investigated. The retention of particulate pollution
   by the porous pavement, which acts as a filter, is clearly demonstrated.
   This study also shows the probable impact of the type of pavement an the
   pollutant content in a dissolved form. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Bulking by Spaerotilus natans has been attributed to several factors
   such as low dissolved oxygen in the aeration basin, wastes with high C:N
   ratios and phosphorus limitation; however, the occurrence of bulking has
   been reported in fruit, vegetable, meat and poultry wastewaters in which
   the ratio C:N is variable.
   Growth of S. natans was analyzed in a model system of st food industry
   wastewater (potato processing waste) that was characterized by HPLC
   determining that citric acid was the most important identified
   component. The effect of several carbon sources on S. natans growth was
   also studied; different C:N ratios were tested in a continuous culture
   system (chemostat). This strain grew in a mineral medium with citric
   acid as a sore carbon source, in spite of the contradictory results
   found in literature. Chemostat studies showed that the medium was
   carbon-limited when C:N ratios <19 mgCOD (mgN-NH3)(-1). Monod kinetic
   growth coefficients, determined for this strain in chemostat were:
   maximum specific growth rate, <mu>(max) = 0.301 h(-1) Monod constant,
   K-S = 4.6 mgCOD l(-1) true biomass growth yield, Y-X/S(T) = 0.490 mgVSS
   (mgCOD)(-1) endogenous decay rate, k(d), = 0.011 h(-1) and maintenance
   coefficient, m(S) = 0.022 mgCOD (mgVSS)(-1) h(-1). The obtained
   parameters were compared with literature data and the effect of glucose
   and citric acid as carbon sources was discussed; these parameters are
   useful in modeling the growth of S. natans in potato processing
   wastewaters (or in other effluents under carbon-limiting conditions)
   especially when citrate is the main component and can be used to control
   filamentous bulking by metabolic or kinetic selection. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of biofilter loading rate on the removal of organic ozonation
   by-products (OBPs) was studied in three biofilters used for the
   pretreatment of drinking water. One of the biofilters contained plastic
   biofilm media (KMT) and the two others contained expanded clay
   aggregates (Filtralite). Tests were carried out with ozonated humic
   water at several OBP concentration levels using empty bed contact times
   (EBCTs) from 6.2 to 48 min. The sum of aldehyde (formaldehyde,
   acetaldehyde, glyoxal and methyl glyoxal) and acetone concentrations
   ranged from 21 to 77 mug l(-1) in the ozonated water. The total ketoacid
   (glyoxylic, pyruvic, and ketomalonic acids) concentrations varied from
   92 to 521 mug l(-1). The results were modelled using a first-order model
   including parameter for minimum substrate concentration (S-min) The OBPs
   showed different sensitivities to decreasing EBCT. Formaldehyde and
   pyruvic acid had the highest specific removal rates and their removal
   was little affected by increased loading rate. Ketomalonic acid had the
   lowest specific removal rate and its removal efficiency was reduced most
   with decreasing EBCT. The other studied OBPs had specific removal rates
   close to each other. The ketoacids had higher S-min concentrations than
   aldehydes and the S-min concentrations were influenced by the influent
   OBP concentrations. The biofilter media did not have a significant
   effect on OBP removal efficiency. Generally, over 80\% removal
   efficiency was obtained for OBPs at EBCTs over 20 min. The significance
   of OBP concentrations close to S-min for the biological stability of
   drinking water needs to be determined. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{We describe a size selective continuous flow filtration method for
   detecting Cryptosporidium oocyst and Giardia cyst in finished water.
   Twenty liters of finished water spiked with oocysts (110) and Giardia
   cysts (60) were filtered through macro (5.0-10.0 mum) and micro (3.0
   mum) pore-sized polycarbonate-track-etch (PCTE) membrane fillers housed
   into two separate 47 mm diameter filter holders joined with a stainless
   steel nipple. The macro-pore-sized filters removed larger unwanted
   particles while allowing the Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts
   to pass through, these being subsequently captured on the
   micro-pore-sized filter. The eluted oocysts and cysts were transferred
   onto the well-slide, stained by IFA and examined microscopically. The
   mean recovery efficiencies obtained for Cryptosporidium oocysts using
   the filter pairs of macro 5 mum and micro 3 mum, macro 8 mum and micro 3
   mum, and macro 10 mum and micro 3 mum were 67.3\%, 77.2-85.0\% and
   76.9-82.2\%, respectively. Whereas the recovery rates for Giardia cysts
   using the same filter pairs were 0, 55 and 77.1\%. The filter pair
   having the pore size of macro 10 mum and micro 3 mum was found to be
   most efficient in the simultaneous detection of Cryptosporidium and
   Giardia in the finished water. This method is simple, easy, rapid and
   economical. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The complexing capacity of some drinking waters for aluminium(III) and
   copper(II) is determined by a ligand titration with metal ions based on
   the use of complexing resins. The resins used in the titration are the
   iminodiacetic resin Chelex 100, the carboxylic resin Amberlite CG50 and
   the anionic exchange resin AG1X8. They allow the detection of ligands
   forming complexes of different stability with the metal ions used for
   the titration, since they have different sorbing properties. After
   equilibration with the resin, the concentration of the free metal ion in
   solution is evaluated from the concentration of sorbed metal ion and
   from the quantity KC, which is the ratio of the concentration of the
   metal ion sorbed on the resin to the free metal ion in solution. It
   strongly depends on the conditions, but it can be evaluated, at the
   considered conditions, From the sorption equilibria of the metal ion on
   the resin. The concentration of the ligands in solution and the
   conditional stability constant are obtained from the Ruzik linearization
   procedure. Very strong ligands of copper(II) and aluminium(III) were
   detected in a tap water sample at concentrations ranging from 10(-7) to
   10(-6) mol kg(-1), and forming complexes having conditional complexation
   constants K-cl = 2.3 x 10(17) (pH = 6.77) and 4.5 x 10(16) (pH = 624),
   respectively, for copper(II) and aluminium(III). Weaker ligands were
   detected using the less strongly sorbing resins Amberlite CG50 and
   AG1X8, but at a concentration equal to that of the strong ligands. This
   was ascribed to the presence of competing metals in solution, not sorbed
   by the weak resins. Two other drinking waters had completely different
   complexing properties both towards copper(II) and aluminium(III),
   containing much weaker ligands. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Peat has been investigated by several researchers as a sorbent for the
   capture of dissolved metals from wastestreams. Besides being plentiful
   and inexpensive, pear possesses several characteristics that make it an
   effective media for the removal of dissolved metal pollutants. The
   mechanism of metal ion binding to peat remains a controversial area with
   ion-exchange, complexation, and surface adsorption being the prevalent
   theories. Factors affecting adsorption include pH, loading rates, and
   the presence of competing metals. The optimum pH range for metals
   capture is generally 3.5-6.5. Although the presence of more than one
   metal in a solution creates competition For sorption sites and less of a
   particular ion may be bound, the total sorption capacity has been found
   to increase. Studies have also shown that metals removal is most
   efficient when the loading rates are low. In addition, recovery of
   metals and regeneration of the peat is possible using acid elution with
   little effect on peat's sorption capacity.
   The utilization of peat and other biomass materials for the treatment of
   wastewater containing heavy metals is gaining more attention as a
   simple. effective and economical means of pollution remediation.
   Pelleting processes can now produce a robust media for a variety of
   applications where traditional methods of pollutant removal would he
   economically or technologically difficult. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Real waste water, which resulted from the oxidative phenol synthesis and
   contained high amounts of organic peroxides (about 300 mmol l(-1)
   including 2000 mg l(-1) cumolhydroperoxide) was treated using one
   fluidized bed biofilm reactor (FBR) with granular activated carbon and
   two upflow suspended growth bioreactors (USB) containing either no
   support or powdered activated carbon (1\%). The continuous operating
   reactors were employed to investigate the part of the activated carbon
   biofilm supports in the degradation of organic peroxides.
   The peroxide containing waste water was degraded by the suspended
   bacteria in the USE very slowly (maximum degradation rate about 30 mg
   TOC l(-1) d(-1)). Moreover, organic peroxides accumulated during the
   treatment. The biodegradation of the organic compounds was completely
   inhibited, if the peroxide concentration exceeded 15 mmol l(-1). The
   biocommunities in the biofilm reactors, however, continued to degrade
   the organic compounds almost completely up to a TOC loading of 1000 mg
   TOC l(-1) d(-1) without any accumulation of organic peroxides. This
   degradation rate was more than 45-fold higher than that obtained by the
   USE without a biofilm support and was shown to be caused by the action
   of the activated carbon biofilm support. The carrier material acted as a
   very effective catalyst for the disproportionation of the organic
   peroxides and the resulting products from the catalytic reaction were
   mineralized by the biocommunity within the biofilm. The transport of the
   toxic substrates to the catalytic active support without damaging the
   biofilm organisms was suggested to be mainly favored by the
   three-dimensional biofilm structure containing dense microcolonies and
   highly permeable channels. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Activated sludge deflocculated when it was exposed to anaerobic
   conditions and shear. The extent of deflocculation, measured as
   turbidity, varied with length of anaerobic period and sludge type (age).
   In order to restore the deflocculated sludge, oxygen was added, and
   subsequently, in less than 1 h, most of the deflocculated matter was
   reflocculated. A certain part of the deflocculated hoc components
   remained, however, deflocculated even after several hours of aeration.
   As the sludge was exposed to repeated deflocculation-reflocculation
   conditions, the flocs were progressively damaged, and an accumulation of
   non-flocculated matter was observed. Measurements of the number of
   bacteria, the concentration of protein, humic substances and
   carbohydrate in the sludge and the supernatant indicated that the
   deflocculated material was mainly composed of bacteria and extracellular
   polymeric substances (EPS) attached to cells or hoc fragments. The
   non-flocculated particles after reflocculation were enriched in bacteria
   and protein, compared to the average sludge composition. A reduced
   deflocculation was observed when nitrate acted as an electron acceptor
   (anoxic conditions), compared to anaerobic conditions. Increased shear
   and decreased temperature reinforced the deflocculation. Field
   experiments showed a temporal variation in flee strengths with the
   weakest flocs present in the winter period. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{In this study, inert COD production in a crossflow ultrafiltration
   membrane anaerobic reactor (CUMAR) system treating brewery wastewater,
   was investigated. The system was operated at a wide range of influent
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations and solid retention times
   (SRT) in order to determine residual non-biodegradable COD produced by
   biomass in the anaerobic reactor. Previous studies showed that the
   wastewater had practically no inert soluble GOD. The inert soluble COD
   in the effluent would, therefore, have been produced in the anaerobic
   reactor by the biomass. Significant increases in the effluent COD
   concentration were observed during the operation of the CUMAR system at
   SRT lower than 100 days. It was also calculated from the results that
   the soluble microbial products measured in terms of COD were found to be
   an average of 2.2\% of the influent GOD. These microbial products were
   not removed from the effluent even with extended operation times.
   Throughout the operation, a maximum of 28.5 kg COD/m(3) day was applied,
   at which point COD removal efficiencies of no lower than 97\% in the
   anaerobic reactor and 99\% in the membrane permeate were achieved during
   the steady-state operation of the CUMAR system. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study investigated the interactions of P and Si with
   ferrous-derived Fe oxides under conditions simulating natural systems.
   Iron oxides were formed from the oxidation of Fe(II) at pH 7.0 under a
   CO2/air mixture. Phosphate and/or silicate were either present during
   the oxidation of Fe(II) or added 24 h after the Fe(II) had oxidized and
   the solid had formed. Oxidation of Fe(II) in the presence of P resulted
   in very high initial P sorption densities; however,much of this sorbed P
   was subsequently released into solution, probably as a result of
   coagulation and crystallite growth of the Fe oxide. If Si was present as
   well during Fe(II) oxidation, initial P sorption densities were very
   high and almost all of the sorbed P remained in the solid phase. The
   formation of Fe(II)-derived Fe oxide in the presence of Si and P
   resulted in a very effective sink for P. This solid may have
   applications in wastewater treatment and important implications for P
   chemistry in the natural environment. The presence of Si during Fe(II)
   oxidation at molar ratios of 0.36 Si/Fe or higher promoted the formation
   of ferrihydrite, an Fe oxide with a high specific surface area and a
   high concentration of reactive surface sites. Coagulation and
   crystallite growth of the ferrihydrite were inhibited by the Si, thereby
   limiting the release of P over time. When P was added 24 h after solid
   formation, the sorption capacity of the mixed Fe-Si oxide was greater
   than the pure Fe oxide bur, in both cases, sorption densities were much
   less than when P and Si were both present during solid formation.
   Competition of Si and P for Fe oxide sorption sites appeared to be less
   important to P sorption than the influence of Si on Fe oxide mineralogy,
   at least under the experimental conditions studied. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Laboratory assays were conducted to assess the anaerobic
   biodegradability of a silver-bearing, waste activated sludge as well as
   the effect of silver compounds on the anaerobic digestion process. All
   assays were performed at 35 degrees C in the dark. The ultimate
   biodegradability of a silver-bearing waste activated sludge (5.0 g
   silver/kg sludge dry solids) was 61\% as compared to 59\% for the
   control (i.e.. silver-free) sludge. The rate and extent of methane
   production was similar for both sludge samples. Addition of either
   silver nitrate or silver sulfide to methanogenic, mixed cultures up to
   an equivalent concentration of 100 mg Ag/l did not affect the rate and
   extent of methane production. Silver thiosulfate when tested at an
   equivalent concentration of 100 mg Ag/l (and 1000 mg S/l), resulted in
   accumulation of ra. 28 mM of fatty acids (mainly acetate), 90\%
   inhibition of methanogenesis and 39\% inhibition of acidogenesis.
   However, when using silver-free, thiosulfate-amended controls, it was
   concluded that the observed inhibition in the silver thiosulfate-amended
   cultures was not attributed to the silver but rather to the excess
   thiosulfate (used as an alternative electron acceptor resulting in the
   production of soluble sulfide at inhibitory levels). Computer
   simulations under typical anaerobic digestion conditions using the
   geochemical equilibrium speciation program MINTEQA2 resulted in.
   extremely low concentrations (<10(-14) M) of free silver ions (Ag+). The
   two predominant insoluble silver species were Ag2S and Ag-c. Therefore,
   due to the high complexing capacity of the anaerobic digester mixed
   liquor as well as the reduction to elemental silver, relatively high
   levels of silver (at least up to 100 mg Ag/l) can be tolerated by
   anaerobic digestion systems. The results of this study have important
   implications on the biological treatment and management of
   photoprocessing wastewaters. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper we present the results of the application of conventional
   and photocatalytic methods for the treatment of hazardous laboratory
   wastes. Liquid wastes from the spectrophotometric determination of NH4+
   as indophenol have been chosen as model samples. The waste composition
   is rather heterogeneous, as phenol, ethanol, nitroprusside and citrate
   can be found, among others. High organic carbon contents (thousands of
   ppm) are found, part of which is volatile organic carbon (VOC) up to
   68\%.
   Three different photocatalytic methods have been tested:
   TiO2-photocatalysis, photoFenton reaction and the combination of H2O2-UV
   light. The degradation process was monitored by Total Organic Carbon
   (TOC) reduction. The effect of experimental parameters, such as pH and
   TiO2, H2O2 and Fe2+ concentrations, has been investigated. The strongest
   TOC reduction was achieved employing the photoFenton reaction with 2.5
   mM Fe2+ and 8 mM H2O2 The effect of solar TiO2-photocatalysis and the
   photoFenton reaction was also studied. TOC reductions of 76.6 and 46.8\%
   were achieved by the photoFenton reaction and TiO2-photocatalysis,
   respectively.
   The mineralization of individual components of the samples:
   nitroprusside, phenol and citrate (1000 ppm of C) was also attempted by
   KMnO4 and the three photomethods. Nitroprusside was the most resistant
   component to be mineralized. PhotoFenton and the combination of H2O2-UV
   light gave the best results for nitroprusside degradation.
   Due to the high TOC content of the samples, an oxidative pretreatment
   with KMnO4 before the photocatalytic treatment was also investigated.
   KMnO4 pretreatment gave reductions of initial TOC as high as 90\% and
   VOC reductions From 30 to 77\%. The remaining solution must be treated
   with KMnO4 if the photocatalytic methods are to be applied later. If the
   sample is not previously treated with KMnO4, not one of the photomethods
   tested is able to reduce the remaining non-purgeable (NPOC) organic
   carbon of the sample. This suggests that KMnO4 oxidizes the organic
   pollutants to other organics compounds that can be more readily
   mineralized by photodegradation.
   The recommended method for the treatment of these wastes consists of a
   pretreatment with KMnO4, followed by the photocatalytic treatment by
   means of photoFenton reaction. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{During the 1994-1997 water years, a hydrogeological study was carried
   out on the alluvial aquifer of Sparta in the Peloponnese, where the
   concentration of nitrate ions in groundwater, as NO3- is well over the
   highest recommended WHO limits of 50 mg l(-). Under specific
   hydrological and chemical conditions with high amounts of dissolved
   oxygen, the migration of nitrate ions in the aquifer, seems to be
   unaffected by any hydrological process, chemical substance or reaction.
   Examination of the relationship between nitrate concentration and
   aquifer properties shows that maximum nitrate concentration values
   follow the main axes of groundwater movement, while zones of increased
   recharge coincide with zones of diluted nitrate concentration.
   Profiles of the evolution of chemical parameters vs depth, show that the
   main process causing nitrate increase in groundwater, is the oxidation
   of ammonia originating from the rapid leaching of inorganic fertilizers
   applied to cultivated areas. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   was strongly related to the air flowrate and this feature was included
   in the oxygen mass balance. The temperature model was based on a heat
   balance of the reactor. Experimental methods for parameter estimation
   were demonstrated. The dispersion coefficient and the oxygen transfer
   coefficient were estimated from tracer studies and off-gas measurements,

Abstract = {{A general dynamic model of the activated sludge reactor, including
   biological processes, hydraulics, oxygen transfer and temperature, was
   verified against both steady-state and dynamic field data. These data
   originated from the Rock Creek wastewater treatment plant located in
   Hillsboro, Oregon (USA). During simulations only one set of the model
   parameters was used. The model was capable of predicting dissolved
   oxygen concentrations and consumption, ammonia concentrations, and
   nitrate + nitrite concentrations with time and distance along the
   activated sludge reactor. Uncertainty analysis enabled the
   classification of model parameters (kinetic and stoichiometric
   coefficients, and wastewater components) according to model sensitivity.
   The maximum growth rate of nitrifiers, mu(A,max), and the ammonia
   concentration, S-NH, were the most sensitive coefficient and wastewater
   component, respectively, when the sum of ammonia. nitrate;nitrite,
   dissolved oxygen concentrations and total oxygen uptake rate was taken
   into account. Application of the model was demonstrated by analyzing the
   impact of changing the operational mode (from A/O process to 4-stage
   Bardenpho) on dissolved oxygen conditions and nitrogen removal. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The responses of three species of coliform bacteria (Citrobacter
   diversus, Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and the
   bacteriophage (virus) phi X-174 to three wavelengths of UV light (254,
   280 and 301 nm) were measured. The values of germicidal efficiency at
   280 nm determined for each of the microorganisms were not significantly
   different. At 301 nm, the values of germicidal efficiency were
   significantly different, but ail values were too small (< 0.06) to
   warrant consideration in the modeling of the germicidal intensity
   delivered by a medium pressure UV system. The data from this study
   provide some evidence that the values of germicidal efficiency
   determined for one species of bacteria or virus may be used to represent
   the relative responses of all bacteria and viruses to medium pressure UV

Abstract = {{The eutrophication of lakes causes serious problems, such as water-bloom
   consisting of the harmful blue-green algae. To prevent an unusual degree
   of growth of phytoplankton, various restoration methods have been tried.
   ``Biomanipulation{''}: which uses zooplankton to prey on the
   phytoplankton, is a promising method because it can, In principle,
   create a desirable ecosystem. However, there are many equivocal points
   in the long-term stability of a newly developed ecosystem after
   biomanipulations. The fate prediction of a water ecosystem using a lake
   mathematical model is thus essential for implementing biomanipulations.
   There remain, however, many uncertain points in the dynamic parameters
   of the lake models, especially the parameters concerned with zooplankton
   and fish. In this study, we established a lake mathematical model based
   on the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus flows among the biotic and
   abiotic substances in a water ecosystem. In this model, two types of
   phytoplankton (non blue-green algae and blue-green algae), three types
   of zooplankton (rotatoria. cladocera and copepoda), planktivorous fish
   (crucian carp), detritus and dissolved matters were considered. The
   dynamic parameters were estimated with a set membership estimation
   algorithm using random scanning based on mesocosm experiments, which can
   provide more rigid data than actual lake observations can. The model
   calculations showed good agreement with the observation data for both
   the non-filamentous blue-green algae dominant case and the filamentous
   blue-green algae dominant case. Using this model, we calculated the
   long-term stability of the effects of biomanipulations in a hypothetical
   lake. The calculation results clarified the blue-green algal species
   specificity in the longterm effects of biomanipulations. In the
   non-filamentous blue-green algal dominant case, the Long-term stable
   suppression of algal growth was predicted under a certain threshold fish
   biomass, while in the filamentous blue-green algal dominant case, the
   suppression was not sustainable even in a no-fish-coexisting series.
   Model simulation is very important to the design of biomanipulations,
   and the model proposed in this study is suitable for this purpose. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, the characteristics of natural manganese mineral
   collected from Guangxi Province. China, including crystalline
   properties, elemental composition, organic substrates content (0.17\%)
   and BET surface area (29.8 m(2)/g), were determined. By X-ray powder
   diffraction and fluorescence spectrograph analysis, it is shown that
   manganese oxide in the natural mineral exists in the crystal structure
   of alpha-Mn2O3 and the contents of manganese (II) and manganese (IV)
   oxides are 4.6 and 42.6\%, respectively. The solubility experiments show
   that manganese dissolved in solution can be ignored at a higher pH
   value, but its significant solubility is observed with the decrease of
   pH value. Moreover. the decolorization properties of direct light red
   F3B dye on natural manganese mineral surface were studied by batch
   technique. The effects of pH value, temperature, inert electrolyte,
   light, particles concentration and size, the presence of calcium and
   phosphate as well as oxygen on the decolorization efficiency of the dye
   were investigated in detail. The results show that the decolorization of
   the dye is strongly dependent on pH value, with lower decolorization
   percentage at higher pH values, and the higher concentration of inert
   electrolyte and temperature favor the decolorization reaction of the dye
   on the particle surface. By Arrhenius Equation. the apparent activation
   energy is found to be at 71.7 kJ/mol, indicating the surface chemical
   reaction as a rate-limiting step in the overall interface process. The
   illumination enhances the surface chemical reaction of the dye on
   manganese mineral particles. The decolorization rate of the dye compound
   is increased with the increase of particle concentration and the
   decrease of size since the available surface sires grow in number. The
   presence of phosphate greatly inhibits the decolorization reaction by
   competitive adsorption on the mineral surface with the dye anion, while
   the addition of calcium promotes the decolorization rate of direct light
   red F3B dye. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{FT-IR spectroscopy was used to study the course of abiotic
   mineralization in samples treated with ozone and ozone:peroxide. The
   importance of oxidative mineralization as a mechanism for dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) removal during disinfection must be determined if
   advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in water and wastewater treatment is
   to be fully exploited. Understanding the full impact of these
   applications is critical for determining how effective a remedy AOPs are
   for eliminating disinfection by-product formation and for assessing how
   well these applications might facilitate compliance with future
   regulatory changes. Although these processes have been shown to surpass
   the level of disinfection afforded by traditional techniques and improve
   biodegradability, this study found that the use of ozone, or ozone in
   combination with hydrogen peroxide, to chemically effect TOC reduction
   may have practical limitations when applied to dilute aqueous solutions
   containing both refractory and degradable dissolved organic carbons.
   Reactions possessing very favorable thermodynamics were found, by an
   indirect measure, to be complicated by solute/solvent interactions which
   may have served to inhibit oxidation. It was also shown that ``close to
   real time{''} CO2 plots generated using highly sensitive FT-IR
   techniques may have some practical utility in assessing mineralization
   potential and optimizing disinfection processes. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The resazurin assay has been used in a limited manner to evaluate sperm
   quality in humans and some domestic animals. We have enhanced the
   sensitivity of the assay by measuring fluorescence instead of absorbance
   and have adapted it to sperm samples from marine organisms (sea urchins,
   scallops, fish) to measure tributyltin (TBT) toxicity.
   Sea urchin, capelin and scallop semen showed measurable levels of
   activity and an acceptable variation coefficient was obtained while
   assessing TBT inhibition. As mitochondria seem to be the main target of
   organotin toxicity, the sensitivity of the resazurin bioassay was
   compared to TBT effects on sea urchin sperm cell and rat liver
   mitochondria respiration rates. The resazurin sperm assay was more
   sensitive to TBT (EC50 = 0.09 ppm) than respiration rates of sea urchin
   semen (EC50 = 9.25 ppm) This information was confirmed by TBT levels
   showing an uncoupling effect on cat liver mitochondria. Significant
   differences were observed between monthly sea urchin sperm activities
   showing that the resazurin test is obviously a parameter varying with
   seasonal sperm quality. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Alachlor is one of the most commonly used herbicides in both Europe and
   North America. Because of its toxic properties, its fate and attenuation
   in natural waters is practically important. This paper assesses factors
   that affect alachlor decay rate in aquatic systems using field-scale
   experimental units. In particular, we used field mesocosms (11.3 m(3)
   outdoor fiberglass tanks) to examine the affect of oxygen level and
   other factors on decay rate in water columns, This is one of the first
   studies ever performed where diverse water column conditions have been
   successfully simulated using common mesocosm-scale facilities. Four
   treatments were assessed, including aerobic systems (aerobic); low
   nutrient, oxygen-stratified systems (stratified-LN); moderate nutrient,
   oxygen-stratified systems (stratified-HN); and anaerobic systems
   (anaerobic). The lowest half-lives were observed in the anaerobic units
   (9.7 days) followed by the aerobic (21 days), stratified-HN (22 days),
   and stratified-LN (46 days) units. Our results indicate that alachlor is
   transformed most rapidly under anaerobic conditions, although the
   ambient phosphorus level also appears to influence decay rate. In this
   study, two common alachlor breakdown products. ethane sulfonic acid
   (ESA) and oxanilic acid, were also monitored. Oxanilic acid was produced
   in greater quantities than ESA under all treatments with the highest
   levels being produced in the stratified-HN units. In general, our
   results suggest that previous laboratory data, which indicated that high
   rates of alachlor decay can occur under oxygen-free methanogenic
   conditions, is translatable to field-scale applications. (C) 2000

   changing the nature and number of adsorption sites for contaminants. Due
   to their effect on the surface charge of colloidal particles they can
   also change the particles mobility and thus their transport behavior. In
   this paper the influence of natural organic matter on the zetapotential
   of kaolinite and montmorillonite is shown. Adsorption experiments with
   kaolinite and montmorillonite show that due to adsorption the humic
   substances are fractionated. The equilibrium pH value does not influence
   the fractionation due to adsorption. Large hydrophobic molecules showed
   the strongest affinity towards the clay surfaces. Substances with a
   small apparent molecular size and a high content of carboxylic
   functional groups made up the non-adsorbing fraction of the NOM. Ca2+
   had no measurable effect on the adsorption. The low influence of the
   adsorbed NOM on the zetapotential of the clay minerals suggests physical
   adsorption as the predominant adsorption mechanism. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The application of powdered activated carbon (PAC) to upflow flee
   blanket reactors (FBR) is widely used to reduce the concentration of
   organic compounds present in drinking water sources. Long carbon
   retention limes can be reached due to the high solids concentrations
   attainable in the blanket. potentially resulting in organic loadings
   close to the maximum adsorptive capacity predicted by the isotherm.
   However, some operating parameters can compromise both carbon retention
   time and adsorption capacity, leading to poor adsorption performance.
   The objective of this study was to point out these parameters and to
   determine whether the carbon capacity determined by the bottle point
   isotherm test can be used to predict the removal of organic
   micropollutants by PAC applied in FBRs. For this purpose, a
   laboratory-scale upflow FBR was used to evaluate the steady-state
   removal of atrazine spiked in a natural water. The results of this study
   showed that the PAC was not used at its maximum capacity predicted by
   batch isotherm experiments, which cannot be attributable to the fact
   that carbon retention times were lower than 20 h. It is hypothesized
   that carbon capacity for micropollutants in continuous-flow systems,
   where the carbon retention time is higher than the hydraulic retention
   time, is a function of the DOC throughput. This study also showed that
   carbon retention time decreases with increasing carbon dose, or
   hydraulic loading rate. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The present paper describes the changes in biofilm density and specific
   activities of carbon. ammonia and nitrite oxidizers within a nitrifying
   up-flow biological aerated filter (UBAF) as a function of the C:N ratio
   in the wastewater entering the filter. The filter was initially fed for
   several months with synthetic wastewater containing only ammonia and
   micro-nutrients and no external organic carbon sourer which favored the
   filter colonization by a fairly stable nitrifying biofilm. In the
   experimentation conditions the reactor resisted the entrance of up 200
   mg COD/l without losing nitrification efficiency. This limit corresponds
   to a COD:NH4+-N ratio of four. Over 200 mg COD/l entering the reactor
   nitrification could no longer reach 100\%. For COD:NH4+-N ratios higher
   than 4 it appeared to be two different zones within the filter. One part
   located at the entrance where organic matter and ammonia entering the
   filter are removed at rates of 3.85 kg TOC/m(3) day and 0.19 kg N/m(3)
   day, respectively. The second part was characterized for showing removal
   rates of 0.42 kp TOC/m(3) day and 0.96 kg N/m(3) day. A valley in the
   dissolved oxygen concentration is revealed as a practical indication of
   the frontier between the two zones. The spatial distribution of
   heterotrophic and nitrifying populations was quantified in terms of
   oxygen uptake rates (OUR) or specific activities at different filter
   heights and for increasing COD concentrations entering the reactor.
   Specific activities of three microbial groups, ammonia oxidizers,
   nitrite oxidizers and heterotrophs aerobes revealed a clear microbial
   segregation along the filter depending on the COD concentration entering
   the reactor. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The removal of Pb(II) by live, resting and dead cells of a lignolytic
   white-rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium was investigated. Kinetic
   studies revealed the fact that adsorption is a two-stage process: a very
   rapid surface adsorption within the first hour and a slow intracellular
   diffusion during 2 h of metal exposure. The results showed that the
   resting cells were able to uptake up to 80 mg Pb(II)/g dry cell. The
   saturation sorption capacities of live and dead cells were 9 and 20 mg
   Pb(II)/g dry cell, respectively. The biomass originated from different
   growth phases and exhibited different adsorption capacities for Pb(II).
   It appeared that the young resting cells held higher Pb(II) adsorption
   capacities than old ones. Acid and alkali pre-treatments of the old
   resting cells increased the sorption capacity; although the capacity of
   virgin young fungi was never attained. Acid treatment of the young cells
   reduced the adsorption capacity remarkably; however, alkali treatment
   improved it. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradation of two fatty alcohol ethoxylates: surfactant C12E10 (C-12
   with an average 10 oxyethylene subunits (EO)) and Marlipal 1618/25
   (C16-18 With an average 25 EO) were tested under the continuous flow
   activated sludge conditions of the classical Husmann plant and a plant
   having a denitrifying chamber. Primary biodegradation and concentration
   of metabolites: free fatty alcohol (FFA) and poly(ethylene glycols)
   (PEG) were measured. PEG were divided into two fractions: short-chained
   (1-3 EO) and long-chained PEG (>3 EO). Tensammetric methods were used
   for analysis. High primary biodegradation was found (96.8 +/- 0.5\% for
   surfactant C12E10 (C12E10) and 99.6 +/- 0.1\% For Marlipal 1618/25
   (Marlipal)), though with a high concentration of metabolites: FFA and
   PEG. FFA concentration corresponded to 30-100\% of theoretically
   predicted concentration (presuming central fission) and dependent on the
   chemical structure of surfactant and type of plant used for testing.
   Total PEG concentration was about 20\% of that predicted on the basis of
   central fission, while the ratio of short-chained PEG in the total PEG
   varied from 20 to 70\% and depended on the chemical structure of
   surfactant and type of plant used for testing. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Particle-bound pollutants from road runoff and their entry into the
   river system were investigated and compared to river bottom sediments.
   The intensity of rainfall is responsible for the wash load, whereas the
   grain size distribution is controlled by the amount of rainfall and
   sorting processes near the sink traps of the streets. While the
   concentrations of suspended heavy metals show a familiar inverse
   relationship to particle size both in road runoff and river bottom
   sediments, the situation for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is
   less clear. They are bimodally distributed. In street runoff, small
   molecules such as three-ring PAHs tend to be enriched in the fine sand
   fraction. Six-ring molecules show maximum concentrations in the fine
   silt fraction. In addition to chemical properties. the activation of
   both particle and PAH sources play an important role. After the input in
   the river system this pattern changes again. The chemical composition
   and structure of organic material become more significant than the
   sources, whereas its amount is only of minor importance. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Cryptosporidium parvum behaves similarly to other low density colloidal

   treatment that has been used primarily for sludge thickening to remove
   low density particles th;ct are generally missed by gravity
   sedimentation treatment. Dissolved air flotation process has been found
   to he effective for removal of fragile floc particles such as Found in
   water treatment. This method has been reported to be effective in
   removing up to 4 log-units of C. parvum in pilot-scale studies, There
   were 138 data points found in the literature that were used to estimate
   the model parameters from the temperature, turbidity and pH of the water
   source as well as the flocculation time. coagulant concentration and
   recycle ratio of the DAF process. The statistical analysis suggested
   that there was a strong positive correlation with the recirculation
   ratio for the recycle feed and a slightly weaker positive correlation
   with the coagulant concentration, water temperature and the time of
   flocculation. Both the pH and the turbidity demonstrated a strong

Abstract = {{Enhanced biological phosphate removal (EBPR) is an established activated
   sludge process although many of the fundamental metabolic mechanisms are
   still poorly understood. Therefore, the stoichiometry and enzymatic
   reactions of the anaerobic phase of this process were studied in a
   laboratory reactor with acetate as organic substrate. Enzyme assays
   showed that acetate activation is performed by acetyl-CoA synthetase.
   Results of C-13-NMR measurements after feeding C-13-labeled acetate
   indicated that glycogen is degraded via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway.
   Energy is supplied by glycolysis, hydrolysis of polyphosphate and
   probably also by hydrolysis of pyrophosphate and the efflux of MgHPO4.
   The ratio of phosphate released to acetate taken up is variable and
   apparently dependent on the contents of polyphosphate and glycogen. A
   biochemical model is proposed explaining the experimental results in
   terms of carbon, redox. and energy balances. Anaerobic operation of an
   incomplete tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) is proposed to explain the
   generation of extra reducing equivalents. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Seasonal and vertical patterns of organic carbon concentration, and an
   organic carbon budget were studied in a deep reservoir in Korea.
   Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) were
   measured in the river inflow and at the dam. Autochthonous production of
   carbon was estimated from phytoplankton primary productivity. Variations
   in POC were greater than for DOG, reflecting pronounced changes in algal
   biomass during the study period. Before the monsoon, in spring and early
   summer, DOC concentrations consistently were low (ca. 1.5 mg l(-1)).
   Heavy rains associated with the summer monsoon had substantial impacts
   on the lake's carbon budget. Turbid storm runoff supplied large
   quantities of nutrients and organic carbon to the metalimnion. Some of
   these substances were advected into the epilimnion, and may have
   contributed to a seasonal increase in primary productivity. Although
   annual rates of carbon supply from allochthonous and autochthonous
   sources were similar, the autochthonous carbon appears to be a more
   important energy source in the lake because most aliochthonous carbon
   was discharged from the dam without affecting the epilimnion. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{High-pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) is a powerful
   technique for determining molecular weight (MW) distributions of aquatic
   humic substances (HS). Previous researchers have shown that HPSEC can
   provide Values of weight average molecular weight (M-w), number average
   molecular weight (M-n), and polydispersity (rho) that are comparable to
   values determined by other techniques such as vapor pressure osmometry
   and held flow fractionation. We have observed that HPSEC does not always
   provide reproducible results for HGS-variability by 10-20\% is common.
   Since certain applications require better precision for MW of HS, this
   research focuses on improving precision and reproducibility of HPSEC
   measurements.
   While the method of baseline correction or of high MW (HMW) cutoff of
   the HPSEC chromatogram is not critical, the choice of low MW (LMW)
   cutoff can greatly affect M-n and rho . For HS, we recommend either 2\%
   of the maximum chromatogram height or MW = 50 as the LMW cutoff,
   whichever is the higher value, and 1\% of the maximum chromatogram
   height as the HMW cutoff. Polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) standards are
   commonly used in combination with acetone; we further recommend the
   inclusion of salicylic acid as a charged low MW standard. Analysis of UV
   detection wavelengths shows that wavelengths between 230 and 280 nm give
   reasonable results, but that higher wavelengths can bias measurements to
   higher MWs. We recommend 254 nm except for low carbon concentration
   samples, where 230 will provide better sensitivity. Our results show
   that ``standardization{''} of HPSEC procedures according to these
   suggestions can lead to excellent reproducibility of M-n and M-w
   measurements for HS (2-3\% RSD). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The degradation of the organic pollutants present in black-olive
   wastewater was carried out by ozonation, aerobic biological degradation,
   and the combination of two successive steps: an aerobic biological
   process followed by an ozonation. Contaminant removal was followed by
   means of global parameters directly related to the concentration of
   organic compounds in those effluents: chemical oxygen demand and total
   aromatic and phenolic contents. In the ozonation, an approximate kinetic
   study was performed to determine the apparent kinetic constants for the
   COD reduction, k(COD), and for the total aromatic reduction, k(A) In the
   aerobic biological degradation, the kinetic study was performed using
   the Monod model applied to the experimental data. In the combined
   process, a higher overall reduction in COD and aromatic content was
   achieved by the successive stages, and there was improved removal of the
   organic material during the second treatment. This enhancement was
   reflected in an increase in the apparent kinetic constants in the
   ozonation of the wastewater that had previously been treated
   aerobically, relative to the Values obtained for the kinetic parameters
   in the single process experiment which were carried out under the same

Abstract = {{Residue analyses and ecotoxicity assessment were conducted on the new
   antifouling compound Irgarol 1051
   (2-methylthio-4-tert-butylamino-6-cyclopropylamino-s-triazine) and its
   degradation product M1
   (2-methylthio-4-tert-butylamino-6-amino-s-triazine) in order to
   delineate the environmental fate and impact of Irgarol 1051 on the
   aquatic ecosystem. For the first time, the Irgarol degradation product
   (M1) was positively identified in environmental samples. During the 1998
   Irgarol survey, concentrations of M1 (up to 1870 ng/l) were generally
   higher than those of Irgarol in the coastal waters of the Seto Inland
   Sea in Japan, suggesting a greater environmental persistence for M1 than
   for the parent compound Irgarol 1051 in the aquatic ecosystem.
   Ecotoxicity testing revealed that Irgarol 1051 and M1 were moderately
   toxic to a marine bacterium and the four crustaceans tested, but were
   highly toxic to some algae and higher plants. In the root elongation
   inhibition bioassay, M1 showed a phytotoxicity at least 10 times greater
   than that of Irgarol and six other triazine herbicides (terbutryn,
   terbutylazine, terbumeton, simetryn, atrazine and simazine). These
   results strongly suggest that both Irgarol 1051 and its persistent
   degradation product M1 may potentially affect and/or damage the primary
   producer community in aquatic ecosystems. To safeguard the aquatic
   ecosystem from the damaging impact of micro contaminants, it is
   recommended that, besides monitoring for the target parent compound,
   major degradation products should also be included in environmental
   surveys. Otherwise, then is a risk of underestimating the ultimate
   impact of a particular toxicant on the environment. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A method was developed for determining biotransformation rate
   coefficients for volatile organic compounds in activated sludge systems.
   It consisted of a sealed batch reactor containing primary substrate,
   VOCs and biomass. A bubbleless oxygenation system was used to supply
   oxygen. Two types of substrate were studied to determine method
   reliability; domestic wastewater and synthetic wastewater, as were
   various conditions; abiotic, biotic, anaerobic, anoxic denitrifying and
   aerobic. The anaerobic and anoxic denitrifying conditions revealed
   minimal VOC biotransformation, while under aerobic conditions, the
   method successfully measured mixed second-order biotransformation rate
   coefficients for the ten VOCs studied. The proposed method will be
   useful to designers and operators of wastewater treatment plants, who
   need reliable kinetic parameters to predict the fate of contaminants in
   wastewater treatment plants. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{On some abandoned manufactured-gas plant sites the presence of a
   particular non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL), namely coal tar, represents
   a potential source of groundwater pollution. The aim of this study was
   to characterise the phase partition of aromatic pollutants between coal
   tar and water. Batch trials have been carried out in order to evaluate
   the state of phase partition equilibrium of pollutants between coal tar
   and water, under variable experimental conditions (temperature, pH,
   ionic strength, coal tar composition). The experimental results clearly
   show that coal tar cannot be considered as an ideal solution with
   regards to phase partition of pollutants with water. The main identified
   mechanisms of phase partition are the quasi instantaneous solubilization
   of pollutants near the coal tar/water interphase, and the diffusion of
   pollutants within the organic phase or at the interphase which controls
   the transfer kinetics of pollutants towards the aqueous phase. The
   dissolution kinetics experimentally observed were therefore correlated
   to a diffusional model of mass transfer. The formation of a film which
   increased resistance to mass transfer was also observed at the coal
   tar/water interphase. This ageing phenomenon of the coal tar/water
   interphase was found to be an important aspect which can have a
   significant influence on the long term fate of coal tar in soils or
   subsoils, as well as on soil remediation techniques. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A quantitative survey of ciliated protozoa and filamentous
   microorganisms from biofilters at 12 different treatment plants along
   the River Po, has been carried out during a period of 1 year from
   February 1996 to April 1997. Altogether 21 species of ciliates and 13
   species of filamentous microorganisms were identified. Other protozoa
   than ciliates, and metazoa were observed also. The dominating organism
   group was crawling ciliates. The occurrence and abundance of the most
   important microorganisms were compared with the physico-chemical and
   operational parameters of the plant. The backwashing interval seems to
   influence the protozoan colonization of biofilters whilst the filtering
   material does not seem to play an important role in the colonization of
   these microorganisms. Crawling ciliates were associated to ammonium
   removal efficiency since their grazing activity on heterotrophic
   bacteria reduced the competition pressure on nitrifying microorganisms,
   supporting their growth. The filamentous bacterium Crenothrix resulted
   particularly linked to the Mn removal efficiency. Factor analysis
   performed on organism groups and physico-chemical parameters, revealed
   that the removal efficiency of Mn and ammonium were related to the
   biotic components corroborating the close interdependence of these two
   processes and their association to the biomass growth. In particular
   some ciliates, such as Aspidisca lynceus and Litonotus sp., resulted
   positively correlated to the ammonium removal efficiency; conversely
   some free-swimming ciliates showed a negative relationship with the
   aforenamed operational conditions and were directly associated with the
   raw water characteristics. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Total nutrition parameters as e.g. total organic carbon (TOC) and total
   bound nitrogen (TNb) are indispensable to water quality and elemental
   nutrient balances. The recommended and most often applied wet chemical
   digestion for TNb measurement, however, is discouragingly labour
   intensive. Therefore, high temperature (690 degrees) catalytic
   (Pt/Al2O3) combustion (HTC) was investigated for simultaneous
   determination of TOC and TNb. Using commercially available instruments a
   fast and simple procedure was established by coupling a TOC-analyzer to
   a chemiluminescence detector (CLD) for determination of NOx gases in the
   combustion exhaust. Dissolved compounds as well as particulate matter
   were used to test carrier gases, hot zone fillings and injection Volumes
   influencing N-recovery rates. Injecting dissolved wastewater components
   (e.g. ammonium, urea, antipyrine) direct onto the catalyst yielded low
   N-recovery rates (40-90\%) depending on concentration. Instead of
   increasing the oven temperature the evaporation of injected sample
   solution was improved which resulted in quantitative recovery rates for
   all investigated compounds except hydrazine.
   A representative number of TNb Values from river and domestic wastewater
   obtained by HTC-CLD were compared to wet chemical digestion. No
   significant differences between the two methods were found. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{ASM3 was tested against experimental data from aerobic and anoxic
   batches as well as full-scale experiments from various WWTPs treating
   Swiss municipal wastewater. A set of kinetic and stoichiometric
   parameters emerged from these tests. The calibrated ASM3 allows the
   sludge production and the denitrification capacity to be successfully
   modeled with a standardized set of parameters. The readily degradable
   inlet substrate Ss., was estimated from respiration measurements by
   curve fitting. This contradicts the suggestion of the IAWQ task group
   that S-S,S-o in ASM3 may be approximated by the total soluble COD as
   determined by 0.45 mu m membrane filtration. Aerobic and anoxic
   respiration of storage products is insignificant compared to growth on
   these products. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The rate of Cryptosporidium parvum inactivation with free chlorine
   decreased with increasing pH in the range of 6.0-8.5, consistent with
   hypochlorous acid being primarily responsible for C. parvum inactivation
   within this pH range. The rate of sequential inactivation of C. parvum
   oocysts with free chlorine after pre-ozonation was characterized by an
   initial rapid decline in viability followed by slower kinetics with
   respective rates at pH 6.0 of approximately six times and twice that for
   free chlorine treatment without pre-ozonation under the same conditions.
   The greatest level of synergy was observed at pH 6; synergy decreased as
   pH increased until no synergy was observed at pH 8.5. Consistent with
   hypochlorous acid being the free chlorine species primarily responsible
   for C. parvum inactivation, within the pH range of 6.0-8.5 the rate of
   secondary inactivation with free chlorine decreased with increasing pH.
   Experiments designed to assess the effect of free chlorine concentration
   on inactivation kinetics provided conclusive evidence for the validity
   of the CT concept in the case of secondary inactivation of C. parvum
   oocysts with hypochlorous acid after ozone pre-treatment. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Organic acid anion concentrations (R-) represent an important part of
   the anion pool in colored surface waters. When the estimation of R- is
   based on a charge balance approach, R- cannot be used for the ionic
   balance control of the correctness of the analyses. We provide here
   another simple approach for R- estimation, which is independent of the
   charge balance. In this approach, R- was estimated using the
   concentration of ionizable carboxylic groups per mass of DOC (X-1), DOC
   concentration and pH. The X-1 value was estimated as the difference
   between the average total concentration of carboxylic groups per 1 mg of
   DOC of natural fulvic and humic acids (10 mu eq mg(-1)) and the
   concentration of metal-complexed carboxylic groups. The latter
   concentration was assumed to be equal to organically-bound Al and Fe,
   When applied to the Bohemian Forest stream waters, the average (+/-
   standard deviation) X-1 was 6.2 +/- 0.8 mu eq mg(-1), R- varied from 2
   to 146 mu eg l(-1), and the average percent difference between the sums
   of cations and anions was 0.7\%. The R- values, obtained using the
   charge balance approach, were strictly comparable (P < 0.001) to the
   values estimated from the proposed approach. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The relationship between phosphorus removal activity and isoprenoid
   quinone, the characteristic of the bacteria community structure, and the
   population dynamics in sequencing batch reactor (SBR) activated sludge
   processes for phosphorus removal were investigated using
   laboratory-scale SBR activated sludge processes. The increase of
   ubiquinone-9 (Q-9) and menaquinone-10 (MK-10) contents in the activated
   sludge accompanied an enhanced phosphorus removal activity. It was found
   that the relationship between phosphorus removal activity and Q-9 and
   ubiquinone-8 (Q-8) contents of the activated sludge was dependent
   neither on the organic substrate composition, nor on the reaction time.
   However. the correlation between phosphorus release activity and
   menaquinone varied with different organic substrates. It can be
   estimated that the enhanced phosphorus removal capability of activated
   sludge was due not to the increase in the phosphorus removal capability
   of bio-P-bacteria, but due to the increase in their populations, i.e.
   species succession of bacteria in activated sludge ecosystems. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to assess the possible removal of cadmium(II)
   or lead(II) from dilute aqueous solution by a synthetic flocculant used
   in the water treatment held. The cadmium(II) or lead(II) complex
   formation with the 3 x 10(6) g mol(-1) average molecular weight
   poly(acrylic acid) (PAA 3 x 10(6)) was examined at pH 6.0, 5.0 and 4.0
   successively using differential pulse polarography as an investigation
   mean. The complexing capacity Cc of the polyacid towards lead(II) at pH
   6.0 was estimated to be 6.3 mmol Pb(II)/g PAA 3 x 10(6) in the operative
   conditions considered here (NaNO3 0.1 mol l(-1); 25 degrees C). The
   conditional stability constant of the PAA 3 x 10(6)/lead(II) complex
   species was determined using the method proposed by Ruzic {[}(1982)
   Anal. Chim. Acta 140, 99-113] assuming that only the 1:1 complex species
   was formed: log K' = 5.3 +/- 0.2 at pH 6.0. Both values decreased with
   the pH of the aqueous medium. The results were compared to those
   previously obtained in the same conditions with copper(II) and
   nickel(II) {[}(2000) Wat. Res. 34, 455-462]. It appeared that the
   binding properties of PAA 3 x 106 increased in the following order,
   depending on the metal ion: Ni(II) < Cd(II) < Cu(II) < Pb(II). This
   result confirmed the conclusions of the previous potentiometric study
   {[}(1999) Talanta 48, 1159-1166]. Finally, the selectivity of PAA 3 x
   10(6) towards copper(II) and lead(II) was examined. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Activated sludge processes are frequently applied to treat industrial
   effluents. The membrane-bioreactor (MBR) is a modification of this
   conventional process, where the activated sludge is concentrated in a
   bioreactor which is connected to a cross-flaw ultrafiltration membrane
   unit. Trials in a MBR with a high activated sludge concentration of up
   to 48 g l(-1), showed that oily wastewater also containing surfactants
   was biodegraded with high efficiency. During the different loading
   stages of the MBR operation a removal rate of 99.99\% could be achieved
   for fuel-oil as well as lubricating oil at a hydraulic retention time of
   13.3 h.
   The maximum biodegradation of fuel oil amounted to 0.82 g hydrocarbons
   degraded per day, and g MLVSS and average values of 0.26-0.54 g
   hydrocarbons g(-1) MLVSS d(-1) could be achieved. The average removal of
   COD and TOC during the experiment was 94-96\% for fuel oil 97, and 98\%
   for lubricating oil, respectively.
   Due to the high removal efficiency of oily pollutants and the complete
   retention of suspended solids by the ultrafiltration unit, the MBR
   system shows good potential for application in industry for process
   wastewater recycling purposes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Interlaboratory comparison of analytical methods requires that analyte
   concentrations in the sample are stable. Consequently, stable samples
   may be analysed when needed rather than immediately. Stability of
   non-ionic surfactant (NS) concentration in raw and treated sewage
   samples preserved with 1\% formaline is investigated over 28 months.
   Apart from preserved water samples their raw and processed ethyl acetate
   extracts are also investigated. The indirect tensammetric method with
   ethyl acetate as monitoring substance is used for NS determination. The
   following conclusions may be drawn: (i) raw and treated sewage samples
   preserved with 1\% formaline are insufficiently stable for long-term
   maintenance of NS concentration; (ii) raw ethyl acetate extracts of
   sewage samples demonstrate limited long-term stability of NS
   concentration; and (iii) dried ethyl acetate extracts of sewage samples
   mixed with chloroform (1:2) exhibit stable NS concentration over a
   minimum of 28 months. This manner of sewage sample preparation may be
   recommended for long-term storage. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Treatment of municipal landfill leachate was investigated/compared using
   sequencing batch and continuous how upflow anaerobic sludge blanket
   (UASB) reactors. All reactors were operated at organic loading rates
   (OLRs) between 0.6-19.7 gCOD/l d. Performance of the continuous UASB and
   sequencing batch UASB reactors were very similar at low and intermediate
   OLRs. Continuous UASB reactors performed more favorably at the higher
   OLRs than the sequencing batch UASB (AnSBR) system. The sequencing batch
   UASB reactor had soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal
   efficiencies ranging between 71\% and 92\% at hydraulic retention times
   (HRT) of 24, 18 and 12 h with dilute to concentrated leachate feed. For
   the continuous UASB reactor, soluble COD removal efficiency was
   consistently between 77\% and 91\% for all HRTs and feed concentrations.
   At high OLRs and fill to react ratios of 0.5, the AnSBR system showed
   signs of system failure. In order to ensure successful. AnSBR treatment
   of municipal landfill leachate the specific organic loading rate during
   the fill cycle (SOLRfill) should not exceed 3 g COD/g VSS d. Both
   systems effectively resulted in a reduction in Microtox(R) toxicity
   levels following treatment. Municipal leachate treated by either
   continuous or sequencing batch UASB reactor was not suitable for direct
   disposal into the sewerage according to Municipal Sewer Regulations. A
   post treatment option such as membrane filtration would be required. (C)

Abstract = {{Slime or biofilm formation on paper machine equipment requires costly
   countermeasures. To provide early detection and efficacy control of
   countermeasures, deposit formation should be monitored. In this study, a
   monitoring method was developed based on differential turbidity
   measurement (DTM). Measurement was performed continuously, on-line,
   non-destructively and in real time. As reference techniques, automatic
   pressure drop (PD) measurement and accumulation of biomass on slime
   boards were used. Both DTM and PD proved to be useful for the
   measurement of deposit formation on line in the side stream of a paper
   machine whitewater circuit. With these methods, the efficacy of chemical
   cleaning procedures and bacteriostatic compounds could be demonstrated,
   whereas enzymes and nontoxic dispersants turned out to be less
   effective. The effect of toxic substances confirms the role of vital
   microbial cells in the formation of the deposits. The use of such
   substances, which represent a potential hazard to the environment, can
   be optimized by automated monitoring systems as presented in this study.

Abstract = {{The present investigation was designed to gain information on the role
   of algae in a deep wastewater self-regeneration pond. The experimental
   pond was continuously fed with secondary effluent from a municipal
   wastewater treatment plant. Biological, physical and chemical profiles
   were recorded throughout the water column during the period July 1996 to
   December 1997. The removal efficiencies of several chemical and sanitary
   indicators were calculated. The time course of species biomass was used
   to evaluate phytoplankton dynamics and its relationship with the
   performance of the deep pond. The efficiency of the system seemed to he
   conditioned by temperature and phytoplankton biomass. Improved
   performance was observed during periods of mixing. Chlorococcales and
   Volvocales grew extensively during stratification periods.
   Euglenophyceae dominated during the mixing. When the total phytoplankton
   biomass exceeded 15,000 mgC m(-3), the removal efficiencies of the
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the suspended solids acquired negative
   values. These phytoplankton blooms were associated with an intense
   increase in pH and, consequently, in NH3 levels, in the epilimnion,
   during the stratification. When such a bloom occurred, considerable
   decreases in zooplankton and bacterial biomasses were observed, which
   temporarily destabilized the trophic structure of the pond. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study was to investigate the removal of
   nitrogen in the form of ammonium ions (N-NH4+) from aqueous solutions
   using natural clay and zeolite. The Croatian zeolite clinoptilolite from
   the area of Donje Jesenje and Croatian bentonite clay from the Kutina
   area were used as natural filtration materials. Alkaline and acid
   modification of natural clay was performed. The N-NH4+ removal
   efficiency by clays in a dry state as well as in a liquid colloidal
   state have been investigated. The highest removal efficiency value for
   N-NH4+ (61.1 wt\%) was achieved with the natural zeolite at the lowest
   used initial concentration, i.e. at a concentration of 100 mg N-NH4+/l.
   With the increase of the initial concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen,
   the removal efficiency quickly decreases. This is expected as zeolites
   and clays have limited sorption capacities. The practical aspect is
   important since an ammoniacal nitrogen elimination of more than 60.0
   wt\% for water containing less than 100 mg N-NH4/l can be achieved. The
   ammoniacal nitrogen removal efficiency is higher for clays in a liquid
   colloidal state compared to the clays in a dry state. It has been found
   that the acid modification of the clay decreases the efficiency of
   ammoniacal nitrogen removal. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Previous study showed that co-composting sewage sludge with lime would
   effectively reduce the availability of heavy metals in the sludge
   compost. In the present study, effects of addition of lime on the
   microbial activities of sewage sludge composting were evaluated in a
   bench-scale in-vessel system through monitoring biological parameters
   including microbial respiration, microbial populations (thermophile and
   mesophile), and activities of related enzyme (dehydrogenase, alkaline
   phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, and urease). Lime raised the pH of the
   sludge compost effectively at the initial period, and this effect became
   less obvious with an increase in composting time. Adverse effects of
   lime amendment on all biological parameters increased with an increase
   in lime application rates, but these effects were generally restricted
   to the early stage of the thermophilic phase. Addition of 0.63\% lime
   prior to sludge composting slightly improved the microbial activity as
   indicated by the higher temperature and CO, evolution and did not exert
   a significant inhibition on bacterial population, and the activities of
   beta- glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, and dehydrogenase after 100
   days of composting. This together with our previous results on heavy
   metal availability supports the use of lime at a rate of <1.0\% (w/w) to
   co-compost with sewage sludge. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Silage effluent is one of the most potent agricultural wastes. The
   ability of yeast strains to grow on and purify silage effluent was
   investigated. Several strains of yeast were isolated from silage
   effluent in pure culture and their ability to grow on silage effluent
   was assessed in comparison with a strain of Candida utilis. Further
   studies were conducted with C. utilis and one of the isolates-strain
   T2B. This filamentous yeast was identified as a strain of Galactomyces
   geotrichum. Both strains were able to grow on three different samples of
   silage effluent of varying age and composition. Mean generation times
   varied from 4.5 to ca. 26 h. Removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and
   total organic carbon (TOC) was good. For the most dilute effluent
   studied 91-95\% COD removal was obtained, while for the most
   concentrated effluent, 74-79\% reductions were obtained. The greatest
   reduction in COD noted was from ca. 40,500 to 8500 mg l(-1). Very high
   reductions of phosphate concentration were obtained and some ammonia was
   removed, pH rose during treatment to 8.5-9 from initial values of

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of catchment characteristics and riverine
   processes on the concentrations of nutrients and total suspended solids
   (TSS) using data from the outlets of 12 tributaries (9-139 km(2)) and 22
   main channel sites of a river draining an intensely cropped area of 1088
   km(2) in SW Finland. For the tributaries, the flow-weighted mean
   concentrations of TSS and total phosphorus (TP), which both reflect
   erosion, were best explained by field percentage and the mean slope of
   the fields of the catchment. The best model describing the concentration
   of dissolved reactive P (DRP) included field percentage and catchment
   area. Total nitrogen (TN) and nitrale + nitrite-nitrogen (NOx-N)
   correlated only with field percentage. Except for DRP, the regression
   models derived from the tributary data rather accurately predicted the
   concentrations in the main river channel. Our results suggest that, with
   regard to lakeless catchments of 10-1000 km(2), the export of TP, TSS
   and N per unit area remains constant. Furthermore, although some P in
   eroded soil particles may be released into dissolved, algal-available
   form during the river transport, erosion control appears not to
   efficiently reduce dissolved P. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Seasonal variations in distribution of methanotrophs in
   trichloroethylene (TCE)contaminated groundwater in Chikura, Chiba, Japan
   were investigated. The hydrostratigraphic units of the area consisted of
   three aquifers which extended over 30-m depth. High concentrations of
   dissolved methane and high electric conductivity were observed in the
   bottom aquifer influenced by fossil water confined below, because of its
   location on the edge of a naturally dissolved methane field.
   Methanotrophs were distributed throughout the three aquifers. Their
   abundance was low in the zone of low-dissolved methane and
   high-dissolved oxygen, while high numbers were observed in the zone of
   high-dissolved methane and low-dissolved oxygen. Groundwater level
   decreased in the season of low precipitation. In the first aquifer,
   seasonal variation of disserved methane showed the opposite pattern to
   that of groundwater level. In this aquifer, a seasonal Variations in the
   number of methanotrophs and dissolved methane were positively
   correlated. This was explained by calculating that dissolved methane
   regulated the abundance of methanotrophs in the first aquifer. Although
   in every aquifer, the pH was within the suitable range for TCE
   degradation by methanotrophs and indigenous methanotrophs had TCE
   degradation ability, variations in the numbers of methanotrophs did not
   show significant correlation with TCE concentrations in groundwater in
   any aquifer. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The fact that the active biomass is continuously removed from the
   continuously stirred anaerobic digesters, leading to long retention
   times, has been overcome in a number of high rate systems based on
   immobilisation of the active biomass, such as the Upflow Anaerobic
   Sludge Blanket Reactor (UASBR) and the Anaerobic Baffled Reactor (ABR).
   A kinetic model of glucose consumption, which was developed based on a
   batch kinetic experiment, was used for the development of a dynamic
   model for the prediction of the behaviour of the recently developed
   flexible reactor called the Periodic Anaerobic Baffled Reactor (PABR)
   {[}(1998) Wat. Sci. Technol. 38(8-9), 401-408]. The PABR may be operated
   as a UASBR, an ABR or at an intermediate mode. The key assumption of the
   model is that the hydraulic behaviour of a PABR is equivalent with the
   behaviour of CSTRs in series as concerning the dissolved matter, whereas
   the biomass is allowed to be retained in the PABR through a retention
   factor accounting for precipitation. The model adequately predicted the
   experimental behaviour of a glucose fed PABR. The model was subsequently
   used to examine the behaviour of the PABR as a function of operating
   conditions, both for constant and varying loading rates. It was shown
   that for different cases, the reactor should best be operated as a UASBR
   or as an ABR. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Complexation of cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn) by dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) in leachate-polluted groundwater was measured using
   a resin equilibrium method. Metal-DOG complexation was measured at
   different DOG concentrations over a range of pH values. The results were
   compared to simulations made by two speciation models (WHAM and
   MINTEQA2).
   Of these models, WHAM came closest to simulating the experimental
   observations although it systematically overestimated the pH dependence
   of metal-DOG complexation. Accepting a variation in the free metal ion
   activity of a factor of 3-4 the WHAM model provided useful predictions
   of the complexation of Cd and Zn by DOG in the pH range 5-8, and of Ni
   in the pH range 5-7. At pH 8, however, the model overestimates the
   extent of Ni-DOC complexation to an unacceptable degree. The MINTEQA2
   model predicts virtually no pH dependence for DOC complexation of Cd, Ni
   and Zn and is thus in very poor agreement with the experimental results.
   As an alternative approach, relations between the conditional complex
   formation constant (log K-c) and pH were estimated for each metal. Using
   these relations for estimating the complexation of Cd, Ni and Zn by DOC
   a deviation in the free metal ion activity up to a factor of 2 can be
   expected. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Grab samples of 101 of raw water were taken on a weekly basis from five

   sampling sites was ultimately intended for human consumption. The
   samples were processed by calcium carbonate flocculation followed by
   sucrose flotation and labelling with a monoclonal antibody, and the
   number of Cryptosporidium oocysts present in each sample was determined
   by fluorescence microscopy. Oocysts were found at each sampling site on
   at least one occasion during the sampling period. The maximum number of
   oocysts found at any particular site was 6 oocysts/l. The maximum number
   of oocysts at three of the sites was found after a period of heavy
   rainfall that was thought to have increased levels of runoff into the
   water bodies. The results of the sampling indicated that Cryptosporidium
   oocysts are widely disseminated in the aquatic environment of the

   concentration of MgSO4 from 0.1 to 0.3 g/l to prevent growth of other
   organisms. The samples were actually contaminated by Pseudomonas, but
   the results show that the formation of Pseudomonas colonies was
   prevented, while no inhibition of growth of Thiosphaera pantotropha
   occurred. This shows that the modified medium can be used for
   quantitative estimation of Ts. pantotropha. This is important as the

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Pages = {{3769-3777}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a new conservative, semi-Lagrangian fate and transport
   model for fluvial systems is presented. Following an outline of the
   current trends in water quality modelling, the main features of Eulerian
   and semi-Lagrangian modelling approaches are discussed. It is argued
   that an inherently conservative semi-Lagrangian approach offers a way of
   meeting the future needs of the industry. The semi-Lagrangian philosophy
   for advection is then outlined and further developed with the authors
   explaining how dispersive transport, simple first-order decay terms and
   inflow boundary conditions can be incorporated within the algorithm. The
   method (termed DISCUS) possesses high accuracy but, in contrast to other
   semi-Lagrangian fluvial transport codes, it is centred around a
   finite-volume based mass balance, which guarantees mass conservation and
   makes it amenable to flux limiting techniques for suppressing
   non-physical grid-scale oscillations. The method's semi-Lagrangian
   character allows it to work at very large time steps, which makes it
   efficient for long-term and multiple scenario simulations. The method's

Abstract = {{In this paper a semi-Lagrangian fate and transport model for fluvial
   systems (DISCUS) is tested against exact solutions and against field
   data. Benchmark comparisons with an exact solution for the uniform
   advection-dispersion-decay equation (single reacting species) show that
   DISCUS possesses excellent accuracy characteristics over a wide range of
   time step sizes with accuracy usually highest at Courant numbers in
   excess of unity. In addition it is shown that numerical accuracy can be
   improved solely by increasing the time step. This is a tremendously
   useful trait of the model since numerical accuracy can be improved using
   reduced computational resources. The model is then tested against an
   exact solution for a multiple reacting species problem, namely computing
   the dissolved oxygen response of a uniform river to a periodic
   bio-chemical oxygen demand. Accuracy is again maintained at large time
   steps: indeed the error remains below 5\% until the time step reaches
   the order of half the time period of the loading. Next the method is
   tested for two real-world water quality modelling situations. Firstly it
   is used to simulate a tracer experiment conducted over a non-uniform
   reach of the River Rhine in Germany. This shows the method's ability to
   handle non-uniform rivers and inflow boundary conditions. DISCUS is
   shown to provide a high degree of accuracy at a small fraction of the
   computational cost of an explicit Eulerian method. Secondly, the model
   is tested against a pulse loading problem for multiple interacting
   species. A spill of milk (providing a bio-chemical oxygen demand) in a
   river in New Zealand provides the test case. This shows the potential of
   DISCUS for dealing with a variety of transformation terms, in this case
   by allowing the introduction of more complicated source and sink terms
   necessary to simulate the anoxic conditions that developed during the
   event. The model produces results of equal accuracy whether small or
   large time steps are used. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of varying phenol concentration on cometabolic transformation
   of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) by Pseudomonas putida in the presence of a
   conventional carbon source, sodium glutamate (SG), was investigated.
   When SG was provided as the sole growth substrate, both the extent and
   efficiency of 4-CP transformation were severely reduced compared with
   that when phenol was the sole growth substrate. By supplementing phenol
   to the mixture of SG and 4-CP, both the rate and extent of cometabolic
   transformation of 4-CP were greatly enhanced. Nevertheless, the presence
   of SG attenuated the toxicity of 4-CP on cell growth and minimized the
   amount of phenol required for the complete transformation of 4-CP. A new
   cell growth pattern characterized by two exponential growth phases
   separated by an intermediate lag phase was observed in this cometabolism
   process. Cells preferentially utilized phenol in the first growth;phase
   while SG was mainly utilized in the second growth phase. With increase
   of phenol concentration, however, it was found that an increasing amount
   of SG was consumed concurrently with phenol in the first growth phase
   and the length of the intermediate lag phase was found to decrease
   linearly with phenol concentration until only one growth phase was
   observed. Analysis of experimental results suggests that the disparity
   of the toxicity of 4-CP to phenol-oxidizing and SG-oxidizing enzyme
   activities is the cause of this new cell growth pattern. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The recovery of EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and metals such

   electrolytic cell, which was separated by a cation exchange membrane
   Neosepta CIM-I. The iridium oxide coated on titanium electrode and
   stainless steel were used as the anode and cathode, respectively. An
   equimolar solution of EDTA and total metals was selected. All
   experiments were carried out at a fixed current density (185 A/m(2)) and
   concentration ratio among metals, but at different initial catholyte pH
   values (1.47-6.0) and total metal concentrations (10.4-31.1 mM). It was
   shown that the initial catholyte pH played the most important role in
   metal recovery. Metal recovery generally decreased in the order Cu-II >
   Pb-II > Cd-II > Zn-II, which was related to the reduction tendency of
   free metal ions. The effect of added supporting electrolytes such as
   NaCl and Na2SO4 on electrolytic recovery was also investigated. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{An ecological study was conducted in New Zealand to examine the
   relationship between incidence of human cryptosporidiosis and indicators
   of community drinking-water supply duality, using routinely collected
   data from June 1996 to August 1998. A total of 790 cases of
   cryptosporidiosis lived in communities with a registered drinking-water
   supply. Within each category of the grading system there was a wide
   range of rates of cryptosporidiosis. The lowest mean rates of notified
   cryptosporidiosis were observed in communities served by drinking water
   supplies with completely satisfactory public health gradings, and the
   highest rates in communities served by ungraded drinking-water supplies.
   Mean rates of notified cryptosporidiosis in drinking-water zones that
   complied with New Zealand drinking-water standards were lower than rates
   in zones that did not comply with the standards. Current methods of
   assessing the quality of New Zealand drinking-water supplies reflect in
   broad terms the risk to human health from Cryptosporidium parvum. Data
   limitations and uncontrolled confounding mean that the excess risk due
   to poor quality of the drinking water supply cannot be quantified, but
   improvements in drinking water quality are likely to be associated with
   health benefits at the population level. Occurrence of a high proportion
   of cases in drinking water supplies with a ``satisfactory{''} public
   health grading highlights the importance of non-waterborne modes of
   transmission in human cryptosporidiosis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper studied oxygen utilization in a 1.5-km sanitary gravity sewer
   section having a slope of 0.0075. The sewer was built with a cement pipe
   in an inner diameter of 450 mm and collects campus sewage at a mean flow
   rate of 0.057 m(3)/s. To evaluate the change of dissolve oxygen (DO) in
   the sewer line, online DO monitorings at both the influent and effluent
   of the sewer section were conducted. Meanwhile, 24-h variations of
   sewage flow rate were also determined by Manning's formula using an
   identified roughness value of 0.011. In addition, on-site measurement of
   the specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) of the suspended solids (SS) was
   conducted during a 24-h sampling period. To compare the SOUR values
   between the sewage phase and the sediment phase, potential SOUR of the
   sediment was also investigated. Further to the SOUR measurements, ATP
   contents in both phases were analyzed. It was found that flow rate and
   DO level in both the influent and effluent varied with time but that
   they were not correlated. The DO decreased progressively along the sewer
   line and the mean concentration difference between the influent and
   effluent was found constant at 3.1 mg/l throughout the entire sewer
   section. Such a constant reduction indicated a substantial oxygen demand
   of the sewer within a hydraulic retention time of 18 min. Although the
   SOUR in the sewage phase fluctuated in time, it was maintained at a
   level of 17.7 mg/g SS/h; while the potential SOUR in the sediment
   slightly decreased in the downstream of the sewer and the mean value was
   found to be 32 mg/g dry wt/h. It is clear that both the sewage and the
   sediment phases are able to uptake oxygen, however, the sediment may be
   more active in uptaking oxygen. The mean ATP contents of the SS and the
   sediment were analyzed to be 0.53 mg/g SS and 0.94 mg/g dry wt. of the
   sediment, indicating that the sediment phase contains more active
   biomass than the sewage phase. The above results demonstrate that the
   sediment phase plays a key role in the oxygen utilization in the
   sanitary gravity sewer. Oxygen budget analysis of the sewer section also
   confirmed this conclusion. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of radical scavengers such as bicarbonate and tert-butanol on
   the Mn-II catalysed ozonation of atrazine, an important herbicide and
   well-established radical probe substance, was studied using a
   conventional gas bubble-contacting column. It was found that the
   presence of a small amount of Mn-II (0.3-1.2 mg/l) greatly increased the
   degradation rate of atrazine, with the formation of byproduct compounds
   of a lower molecular weight and a greater polarity (as indicated by
   shorter retention times in HPLC chromatography). However, the presence
   of either bicarbonate or tert-butanol had a negative effect on the
   degradation of atrazine. With an increase of bicarbonate concentration,
   the oxidation rate of atrazine by Mn-II-catalysed ozone was
   substantially reduced and a correspondingly higher residual ozone was
   observed. In the presence of tert-butanol, greater reductions of the
   degradation rate of atrazine were observed and the decomposition of
   ozone was greatly retarded, resulting in a higher residual ozone; this
   was the case for either ozone oxidation alone or Mn-II catalysed ozone
   oxidation. These results appear to confirm that the degradation of
   atrazine by ozone in the presence of Mn-II follows a radical mechanism.
   It is believed that Mn-II catalyses the decomposition of ozone through
   the formation of intermediate manganese species (such as Mn-IV), leading
   to the generation of hydroxyl radicals. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The use of duckweed in domestic wastewater treatment is receiving
   growing attention over the last few years. Duckweed-based ponds in
   combination with anaerobic pre-treatment may be a feasible option for
   organic matter and nutrient removal. The main form of nitrogen in
   anaerobic effluent is ammonium. This is the preferred nitrogen source of
   duckweed but at certain levels it may become inhibitory to the plant.
   Renewal fed batch experiments at laboratory scale were performed to
   assess the effect of total ammonia (NH3 + NH4+) nitrogen and pH on the
   growth rate of the duckweed Spirodela polyrrhiza. The experiments were
   performed at different total ammonia nitrogen concentrations, different
   pH ranges and in three different growth media. The inhibition of
   duckweed growth by ammonium was found to be due to a combined effect of
   ammonium ions (NH4+) and ammonia (NH3), the importance of each one
   depending on the pH. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An existing model of sediment wash-off from paved surfaces has been
   extended to predict fine granular sediment inputs into drainage systems
   via roadside gully-pots. The model comprises three separate components:
   (1) a model of sediment accumulation on paved surfaces; (2) a model of
   sediment wash-off from these surfaces; and (3) a model of sediment
   deposition and erosion in gully-pots. The first two model components
   have been previously successfully tested, whereas the third component of
   the model is presented in this paper for the first time. The model was
   applied to two small catchments located in Dundee, Scotland, where data
   on flow rates and sediment concentrations were collected at the inlets
   into the main drainage systems from the road gullies. It was found
   necessary to calibrate only the build-up component of the model to
   achieve good agreement between the simulated and measured data. It was
   concluded that only two calibration parameters are required to model the
   input of fine granular sediment into storm drainage systems via

Abstract = {{Soil at a site near Zibo City, China, is polluted with hydrocarbons at
   concentrations up to 200 g kg(-1) dry soil. Samples contained 10(7)
   microbial cells g(-1) dry soil, and the concentration of aerobic
   degradation bacteria is 107 cells g-l dry soil. The most active species
   were Xanthomonas, Bacillus and Hyphomicrobium. The nitrogen and
   phosphorus contents of the polluted soil are typically 0.1\%, and are
   sufficient to sustain natural or enhanced biodegradation. The BAC
   (Biological Activated Carbon) system was used to enrich indigenous
   microbes to enhance bioremediation rates in the laboratory. The BAC used
   the large surface area and sorption characteristics to fix bacteria and
   media, and effectively culture and enrich the microbes. Effluent from
   the BAC system contained up to 4 x 10(11) cells ml(-1), and was
   introduced to the contaminated soil to enhance biodegradation. The
   results indicated that the natural biodegradation rate of the petroleum
   hydrocarbons is lower than the BAC enhanced bioremediation rate, 1.7\%
   as opposed to 42\% in 32 days. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of the operating condition, such as transmembrane pressure
   and crossflow velocity on the scale formation pathways, was investigated
   in nanofiltration (NF) of a CaSO4 solution. The examination of scanning
   electron microscopy of a fouled membrane surface provided strong
   evidence that there are two mechanisms in NF fouling (e.g., scale
   formation on the membrane surface) in nanofiltration; surface and bulk
   crystallization. The hydrodynamic operating conditions determined which
   fouling mechanism was dominant. The fouling due to surface
   crystallization augmented with an increase in operating pressure, but
   reduced with an increase in flow velocity. Concentration polarization
   was found to be responsible for this type of fouling. On the other hand,
   the extent of fouling by bulk crystallization appeared to be the most
   important at intermediate crossflow velocity and higher operating
   pressure (e.g., higher flux) because both secondary nucleation effect
   and deposition probability depends on crossflow velocity and permeation
   rate. An experimental and theoretical method for differentiating one
   mechanism from another was explored in order to elucidate the dominant
   fouling mechanism according to the hydrodynamic conditions. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The performance of an anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR, 10 l and eight
   compartments) treating a dilute wastewater (500 mg COD/l) was studied.
   The reactor was started with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 80 h at
   35 degrees C, and this was steadily reduced to 10 h eventually; all HRTs
   tested resulted in more than 80\% COD removal. The temperature was then
   reduced to 20 degrees C, which gave a removal efficiency of 70\%, and
   finally to 10 degrees C, which resulted in only 60\% COD removal.
   Residence time distribution studies were carried out to monitor
   hydrodynamic flow characteristics and dead space after each decrease in
   temperature. Not much difference in mixing or dead space was observed
   under the different conditions tested. The average dead space was
   25-30\%, and the flow pattern within the reactors showed an intermediate
   behaviour between plug-flow and ideally mixed. Finally, anaerobic
   bioassays were used to evaluate the activity of the biomass. The biomass
   retained its initial specific acetogenic and methanogenic activity
   throughout the compartments of the reactor, and hardly any selection for
   psychrophilic bacteria had taken place. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{We examine how the use and management of water resources and waste-water
   inputs affect the stream flow and its biological quality in a
   Mediterranean stream, the Congest (NE Spain). Agricultural, farming,
   urban and industrial activities take place from its headwaters to its
   lower section, and there are many weirs and wells along the stream. The
   effects of four sewage plants, built in the basin in the last 5 years,
   on river flow and water quality are analysed. Today most of the river
   flow comes from the sewage plants and few or any dilution from natural
   stream exist. In the upper part of the basin two biological plants are
   located, due to the lack of dilution, the biological recovery of the
   freshwater community is poor, although coarse fish communities may be
   found at the end of this section. In the middle and lower parts of the
   stream, water is treated in two physicochemical plants, and as a result,
   the stream in this section has no fish or macrofauna at ail. It is
   concluded that in Mediterranean streams, end-pipe measures, even using
   biological plants, may be insufficient for the recovery of stream
   communities due to the lack of natural flow related to the climate and
   the high demand of the water resources. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{A batch reactor was used to evaluate the advanced oxidation process of
   the UV/H2O2 system for control of natural organic matter (NOM) in
   drinking water. The light sources used include a 450 W high-pressure
   mercury vapor lamp and sunlight. Both quartz and Pyrex filters were used
   to control the wavelength and energy of UV light applied to the aqueous
   systems. The results showed that NOM oxidation and H2O2 decomposition
   followed first-order and zero-order reaction kinetics, respectively. The
   optimum H2O2 dose was found to be 0.01\% for the oxidation of humic
   acids in this study. Carbonate and bicarbonate ions inhibited the
   degradation of humic acids. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The sonolytic inactivation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) is reported.
   The impact of power intensity, dissolved gas and ultrasonic frequency on
   the germicide effectiveness of sonification has been explored. The
   inactivation of E. coli exhibits pseudo-first order behavior, and
   depends moderately on total power and power intensity at a frequency of
   20 kHz. The rate coefficients in an oxygenated solution vary from 0.031
   to 0.046 min(-1) when the power intensity ranges from 4.6 to 74 W cm(-2)
   Inactivation occurs most readily at the highest sound intensity, 74 W cm
   Three dissolved gases were investigated: oxygen, argon, and an
   argon/oxygen mixture. The nature of the dissolved gas does not strongly
   influence the magnitude of the inactivation coefficients which varied
   from k = 0.027 min(-1) to 0.047 min(-1). Ultrasonic frequency, within
   the limits of 205-1017 kHz, displays a strong influence on the rate of
   E. coli inactivation in oxygenated solutions. The rate coefficients vary
   from 0.030 to 0.078 min(-1) The most effective ultrasonic frequency for
   E. coli innovation is 205 kHz; the rate coefficient (k = 0.078 min(-1))
   is greater than the coefficient at 1071 kHz (k = 0.030 min(-1)) by a
   factor of 2.6 and 358 kHz (k = 0.064 min(-1)) also demonstrates a
   greater efficiency than either 618 kHz (k = 0.041 min(-1)) or 1017 kHz.

   permitted the relatively rapid assessment of the extent and site of

Abstract = {{An electrolytic process for the removal of lead from aqueous solutions
   using a flow-through cell with a recycled niobium felt is proposed. The
   operational conditions for the reactor were optimised as a function of
   the solution how rate and the electrolytic removal of Pb(II) was used to
   characterise the mass transport properties of the niobium felt
   electrode. The three-dimensional cathode was made from continuous
   niobium tips resulting from niobium ingots machining. The performance
   and figures of merit of the niobium felt were studied using different
   flow rates. In the experiments lead concentration dropped from 50 mg
   l(-1) to 0.5 mg l(-1) (99\% removal) in electrolysis time ranging from
   94 to 150 min, depending on the flow rate. Dimensionless Sherwood and
   Reynolds numbers were correlated to characterise the mass transport
   properties of the niobium felt, and they were fitted to the equation Sh

Abstract = {{TiO2 mediated photodegradation of 4-tert-butylpyridine (from now on tBP)
   in the presence of H2O2 was absent for ail practical purposes, because
   only 3\% of the stoichiometric amount of CO2 was generated under mercury
   lamp irradiation (120 W). This study has the objective of rationalizing
   why in the presence of TiO2 and light the tBP molecule does not degrade,
   but it readily undergoes mineralization in homogeneous solution in the
   presence of Fe3+/H2O2. The adsorption of tBP on TiO2 was observed to be
   less than or equal to 1\% and was also found to be a function of the
   suspension pH. The low adsorption observed was due to the lack of
   electrostatic attraction between the ionic species of tBP and on the
   TiO2 surface in well defined pH regions. To explain this effect, the
   speciation of the two reactants was modeled as a function of pH.
   Fenton photo-enhanced reactions led to full mineralization of tBP in
   relatively short times following an induction period. No complex
   intermediate was observed between tBP and Fe3+. In a typical run tBP
   (7.4 mM) in the presence of H2O2 (5.8 x 10(-2) M) and Fe3+ (1.5 x 10(-2)
   M) in aqueous solution was seen to mineralize in a little more than 2 h.
   The same solution irradiated in the presence of TiO2 instead of Fe3+ was
   seen to generate only about 3\% of the stoichiometric amount of CO2. The
   mineralization products of tBP were identified as CO2, NH4+ and NO3-.
   The timing of the oxidant addition during the degradation process was
   shown to either reduce the time of tBP degradation or minimize the
   required amount of H2O2. Aqueous solutions of tBP generate CO2 in the
   presence of H2O2 and Fe3+ in the dark and under light after an induction
   period. The mineralization due to Fenton reactions in homogeneous media
   was observed to follow pseudo-first order decay kinetics. This work
   describes and explains the absence of reaction limitations during the
   photodegradation of tBP in Fenton photo-assisted reactions as compared
   to TiO2 photocatalytically mediated processes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This paper deals with use of water hyacinth and its root mats for
   controlling algal concentrations in the effluent from waste
   stabilization ponds (WSPs). Pilot-scale integrated processes coupled
   WSPs with multiple WHPs (water hyacinth ponds) were operated in order to
   determine the effects of the plant and root mars on reduction of algal
   concentrations on a quantitative basis.
   As flows from WSPs passed through the WHPs, root mats in the bottom as
   well as leaves and stems on the water surface of WHPs separated and
   controlled significant amount of algal cells by various mechanisms such
   as attachment, settling, respiration and suppression of algal growth.
   Attachment of algal particles to the plant roots was very similar to
   adsorption processes; i.e. there is a maximum capacity in a given weight
   of roots. However, effluent algal concentrations did not increase at
   saturation probably because of the sloughing-off of attached particles
   as a clump from the roots and generation of new attachment sites due to
   the growth of roots. Additionally, this paper discusses attachment
   forces and other issues concerning polishing of the WSPs effluent by
   WHPs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The artificial neural network (ANN) is known as an excellent estimator
   of nonlinear relationships between accumulated input and output
   numerical data. Using this nature of the ANN, the optimal coagulant
   dosing rate can be predicted from the operating data with accuracy and
   in time. But, the accumulated operating data used in ANN training may
   have some corrupt and noisy data records. So, to enhance the reliability
   of the trained ANN, a data preprocessing method is necessary for
   preparing the train and test data set. In this study, a data
   preprocessing method was devised, four data sets were prepared using the
   proposed data preprocessing method and the prediction capabilities of
   the ANN by each data set were compared in terms of a root-mean-square
   normalized error (RMSE). The purpose of the data preprocessing method is
   to remove the outliers of the confidence interval (CI) of the predicted
   value of the trained ANN from the accumulated operating data set. The
   data set prepared by data preprocessing shows enhancement of the
   learning rate and the terminal error. That is, the decrease in the
   confidence interval of the predicted value leads to an increase in the
   number of outliers, which results in a rapid learning rate and small
   terminal error. The ANN trained by the preprocessed data set also
   improves the prediction capability for the test data set. These results
   mean that the proper data preprocessing method can facilitate the ANN in
   formulating the latent structure and in removing real noises and
   measurement errors within the training data set. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Petroleum products such as diesel fuels may be released into the marine
   or coastal environment by discharges of ballast and bilge waters, dry
   dock activities, and tanker and non-tanker accidents. In addition to
   containment and recovery of spilled petroleum products, the treatment of
   seawater in a spilled area may be needed in order to reduce potential
   damages to aquatic organisms and their habitats. This paper reports on a
   laboratory study which evaluates the biodegradation efficacy of a
   dispersed diesel fuel under high salinity conditions using an aerobic,
   upflow submerged biofilter coupled with a trickling filter, which is
   used to capture and treat volatile organic compounds (VOCs) escaped from
   the biofilter caused by aeration. The experimental data indicate that
   total organic carbon (TOC) is removed with >90\% efficiency in the
   biofilter at a feed TOC concentration of 1000 mg/l and a volumetric
   loading of 1.5 kg TOC/m(3)-day. A first-order kinetic equation is
   developed to describe the observed TOC removal in the biofilter, and the
   first-order rate constant is estimated as 0.17 h(-1). Moreover, under
   the conditions tested VOCs account for approximately 8\% of the diesel
   fuel fed to the biofilter. The trickling filter is capable of removing
   68\% of VOCs captured at an empty bed retention time of 10 s. (C) 2000

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{A model, utilizing the multiple point source summation approximation for
   a linear lamp, is presented for the calculation of the fluence rate
   distribution and the average fluence rate in an ultraviolet (UV)
   reactor. The model is sophisticated, in that it accounts for both
   reflection and refraction as a beam of UV radiation passes through an
   air/quartz/water interface. When the effects of reflection and
   refraction are ``turned off{''} (by setting the refractive indices to
   1.000), there is only a small increase (similar to 6.5\% arising from
   reflection) in the calculated average fluence rate for 10 mm path length
   transmittance (T-10') values less than 70\%. Thus, under these
   conditions, the effects of reflection and refraction can be safely
   neglected (with a 6.5\% correction for reflection). In many practical
   applications, such as drinking water treatment, the T-10' is usually
   much larger than 70\%, where the error of neglecting refraction and
   reflection can be as large as 25\%, and thus the more sophisticated
   model should be used. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The influence of UV-B irradiation in estuarine water from the salt marsh
   of Corroios, Tagus river, was studied in the laboratory in terms of lead
   speciation.
   The filtered water was exposed to UV-B irradiation with a intensity of
   540 mu W/cm(2). The effect of UV-B (280-320 nm) was studied from the
   titration with Pb2+, followed by anodic stripping voltammetry in
   differential-pulse mode, after different periods of irradiation time,
   from 1 h up to 10 days.
   It was found that, before UV-B irradiation, Pb2+ speciation can be
   interpreted assuming two different types of ligands: one macromolecular,
   with an heterogeneous behaviour represented by two main groups, while
   the other is a small ligand, homogeneous in terms of Pb2+ complexation.
   Stability constant values indicate that the heterogeneous ligand
   presents a humic-like behaviour, with minor sites related to phenolic,
   amino or sulphur type groups, and major sites related to carboxylic type
   groups. Small homogeneous ligands, probably released by bioorganisms,
   also present stability constants of carboxylic type groups.
   From the results it can be observed that UV-B irradiation decreases
   complexing strength of the medium as well as its heterogeneity, both
   effects becoming evident after 1 h of irradiation. Even so, for the
   concentration range studied (C-Pb less than or equal to 2 x 10(-6) M)
   more than 80\% of Pb-II still remains complexed to the weaker group of
   the macromolecular ligand.
   Since UV-B doses are similar to maximum spring solar intensity, the
   results suggest both chemical and ecological implications. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{A physically based numerical model is developed to simulate pollutant
   dissolution and transport in overland flow with infiltration effects.
   The numerical simulation of the complete process requires the solution
   of the unsteady, two-dimensional St. Venant equation, an equation for
   the infiltration process and the pollutant transport equation. The
   solubility rate equation proposed in this study is used to model the
   dissolution of a specified spatial distribution of solid pollutant into
   the liquid phase. The set of equations governing the complete system are
   integrated numerically using various finite difference algorithms. The
   model may be used to predict the ultimate fate of a surface applied
   solid pollutant by evaluating the proportions that are dissolved,
   infiltrate into the subsurface or are washed-off. The hydraulic portion
   of the model has been validated against published field data with
   satisfactory agreement. Verification of the complete model, however, is
   based on a comparison with limited laboratory test data. Proper
   validation would require extensive experimentation, preferably in the
   field which is, up to now, unavailable. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Experimental protocols to identify and quantify nitrogen nutrient
   deficiency in the activated sludge process were developed and tested
   using respirometry. Respirometric experiments showed that when a
   nitrogen nutrient deficient sludge is exposed to ammonia nitrogen, the.
   oxygen uptake rate (OUR) of the sludge increases while an initial
   nitrogen nutrient uptake takes place at the same time. Our investigation
   suggests that this initial nitrogen uptake is metabolically mediated.
   The protocols developed in this study can be used: (a) to assess whether
   a sludge sample is nitrogen nutrient deficient or not; and (b) to
   estimate the amount of nitrogen required to remedy a nutrient deficient
   condition in the sludge. Finally, a respirometry-based strategy to
   control nutrient addition to the activated sludge process is proposed.

Abstract = {{A range of nanofiltration (NF) modules was evaluated to determine

   potential (THMFP), haloacetic acid formation potential (HAAFP), and
   chloral hydrate formation potential (CHFP) rejections averaged 90, 97,
   94, and 86\%, respectively. Rejections of bromide ion, an inorganic
   precursor, ranged from 40-80\%. Pretreatment using microfiltration (MF)
   alone before NF provided some removal of turbidity but not enough to
   maintain the initial Bur and recovery of the NF unit. NF runs were
   sustained over 30 days; however, some adverse changes in operational
   conditions were observed, and significant pressure increases were
   necessary to maintain flux. Precursor rejections by NF following MF
   varied little over time frames of up to 30 days. MF was only moderately
   effective in particle removals, with virtually no DBP precursor removal
   provided by MF. Ultrafiltration (UF) alone did not exhibit significant
   changes in operational conditions over a 30-day time frame, however,
   only modest precursor (<30\% DOC) removal was observed. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Alternatives that are generally considered as a water supply line for
   conveying the collected and treated water from the source to community
   are studied. To evaluate and rank these alternatives, several indicators
   are then made based on the technical feasibility of methods for
   constructing a water supply pipeline, the safety of hydraulic pressure
   or velocity, and the reasonableness of the cost required. However,
   assessing technical feasibility, safety and cost contains elements of
   uncertainty due to a lack of available information, the randomness of
   future situations, and the incomplete knowledge of the expert. In this
   study, a methodology using fuzzy sets is presented to assist decision
   makers in evaluating various water supply lines with uncertain
   information, in order to decide a proper line. The methodology allows
   decision makers to characterize associated uncertainty and incorporate
   it directly into the decision-making process so decisions can be made
   that are more appropriate and realistic than those made without taking
   uncertainty into account. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Trihalomethanes (THMs) are formed as a result of the interaction of free
   aqueous chlorine, used as a disinfectant in drinking water, with the
   organic matter in raw water. Although chlorinated, brominated and
   chlorobromotrihalomethanes are the most common disinfection by-products
   reported, iodinated trihalomethanes (ITHMs) can be formed when iodide is
   present in raw water, ITHMs have been usually associated with several
   medicinal or pharmaceutical taste and odor events in drinking water. For
   instance, the odor and taste threshold concentrations of iodoform are
   0.02 and 5 mu g/l, respectively. Different analytical techniques have
   been studied to identify these compounds but their quantitative
   determination has not been performed due to the lack of commercial
   standards. In this study ITHMs (CHCl2I, CHClI2, CHBr2I, CHBrI2 and
   CHBrClI) have been synthesized in order to evaluate headspace (HS),
   purge and trap (P\&T), closed loop stripping analysis (CLSA) and
   liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) as analytical methods for determination.
   HS and LLE were followed by gas chromatography and electron capture
   detector (GC/ECD); whereas P\&T and CLSA with gas chromatography and
   mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The most appropriate method, LLE/GC/ECD, was
   applied to evaluate the stability of ITHMs in water (ultrapure, raw and
   treated water) in order to confirm their presence in tap water. Ascorbic
   acid was the quenching reagent chosen to avoid free chlorine at the time
   of sample collection. Finally, samples from the different stages of the
   treatment plant in Barcelona (NE Spain) were analyzed. Only three
   (CHCl2I, CHBrClI and CHBr2I) of the six ITHMs were identified and
   determined, at average levels lower than 1 mu g/l, in sand filtered and
   ozonated waters. No ITHMs were identified in distribution system water.

Abstract = {{A new approach for groundwater treatment combines a permeable Fe(0)
   barrier to break down higher chlorinated solvents like PCE and TCE with
   a downgradient aerobic biological treatment system to biotransform less
   chlorinated solvents, such as DCE and vinyl chloride (VC), and petroleum
   hydrocarbons. The expected bacterial performance downgradient of an
   Fe(0) barrier was evaluated through laboratory batch experiments with a
   toluene-degrading mixed culture that cometabolically transforms
   cis-1,2-DCE and VC.
   The amount of cis-1,2-DCE (initially at 500 ppb) and VC (initially at
   250 ppb) transformed was controlled by the initial toluene (0-12,000
   ppb) and biomass (0-15 mu g protein ml(-1)) concentrations. Cis-1,2-DCE
   was removed much more effectively than VC, and a higher toluene
   concentration in comparison to the co-substrate concentrations was
   needed for complete co-substrate removal. Competitive inhibition was
   indicated by the sequential degradation of toluene and the
   co-substrates. When the pH was above 8, the effectiveness of cis-1,2-DCE
   and VC transformation decreased rapidly for a given toluene
   concentration. 1,1-DCE, a product of the reduction processes within the
   Fe(0) barrier, hindered the transformation of toluene, cis-1,2-DCE and
   VC at concentrations as low as 10 ppb. Acetylene, another chemical
   reaction product; only marginally inhibited the transformation of the
   co-substrates in the studied concentration range of 0-1700 ppb.
   Overall, the coupling of an Fe(0) barrier and subsequent biodegradation
   appears feasible for remediation of complex mixtures of chlorinated
   solvents and petroleum hydrocarbons in groundwater. Our results suggest
   that supplemental toluene or other primary substrate upgradient of the
   biological process may be required, and that pulsing of this substrate
   may be advisable. Because passing through a permeable Fe(0) barrier
   increases the groundwater pH, neutralization with acid may be needed
   before entering the bioactive zone if the natural buffer capacity of the
   soil is insufficient. Breakthrough of 1,1-DCE from the Fe(0) barrier
   could prove a critical factor for the bacterial performance. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Many aromatic compounds are oxidized but not completely mineralized by
   Fenton's reagent. Little attention has so far been given to the
   identification of residual organic matter and the evaluation of its
   toxicity. In this work, the oxidation of metol
   {[}N-methyl-p-aminophenol] by Fe2+/H2O2 in the dark as a model for
   aromatic amines and alcohols was examined. Analysis of oxidized
   solutions was performed by both LC-electron impact (EI)-MS and
   LC-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS, It was checked that the degradation
   of metol takes place via direct oxidation by Fe3+ and OH. attack.
   Intermediates amenable to oxidation by OH. are basically partially
   oxygenated aromatic species, dimerization products and polymers. End
   products not amenable to oxidation by this radical are ferrycarboxylate
   complexes, which are non-toxic to UC581 bacterial cells. These complexes
   fan be completely destroyed by irradiation with light. The photo-Fenton
   reaction is therefore an effective choice for the in situ treatment of
   industrial effluents containing aromatic amines and hydroxylated
   species. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A full-scale and detailed intrinsic bioremediation investigation was
   conducted at a gasoline spill site in Dublin, North Carolina, USA. Due
   to the appearance of nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) hydrocarbons beneath
   the former spill location, dissolved BTEX (benzene, toluene,
   ethylbenzene, and xylene isomers) are being continuously released from
   NAPL into the groundwater with a total BTEX concentration of 60 mg/l. At
   this spill site, a cropland extends from the mid-plume area to the
   downgradient edge of the plume. Approximately 15 mg/l of nitrate as
   nitrogen was detected in groundwater beneath the cropland due to the
   usage of fertilizer. During the three-year study, the following tasks
   were conducted: groundwater analysis; microbial enumeration; and (3)
   mass flux and decay rate calculations. Results show that BTEX
   concentrations dropped to below detection limit (BDL) before they
   reached the downgradient monitor, well located 110 m from the spill
   location. Groundwater and microbial analyses indicate that iron
   reduction was the dominant biodegradation process between the source and
   mid-plume area. However, nitrate spill in the cropland area switched the
   degradation pattern to denitrification, and also changed the
   preferential removal of certain BTEX components. Under iron-reducing
   conditions, toluene and o-xylene declined most rapidly followed by m +
   p-xylene, benzene, and ethylbenzene. Within the denitrifying zone,
   toluene and m + p-xylene had very rapid degradation, followed by
   ethylbenzene, o-xylene, and benzene. The mass flux calculations show
   that up to 93.1\% of the BTEX was removed within the iron-reducing zone,
   and 5.6\% of the BTEX was degraded within the nitrate spill zone. The
   remaining 1.3\% was removed within the oxidized zone at the downgradient
   edge of the plume. Toluene had the highest first-order decay rate
   (0.16\%) detected in the iron-reducing zone and benzene had the lowest
   rate (0.07\%) within the denitrification area. Results reveal that the
   mixed intrinsic bioremediation processes (iron reduction,
   denitrification, methanogenesis, aerobic biodegradation) have
   effectively contained the plume, and iron reduction played an important
   role on the BTEX removal. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In different European countries new legislative regulations and laws
   demand the reduction of the amount of wastes. In nature, the reduction
   steps of organic compounds in waste material are managed by symbiotic
   organisms, where a combination of aerobic and anaerobic degradation
   sequences leads to a near mineralization of organic material. Modeled on
   this principle, the process presented here combines a two-stage
   digestion with a following aerobic mineralization step. To gain a
   maximum amount of methane which is a regenerative energy carrier, the
   process reducing organic waste-in this case kitchen refuse- was begun by
   a run through a digestion cascade. The residues from the anaerobic step,
   containing mainly lignocellulosic substances that are recalcitrant to
   anaerobic degradation, were concentrated and then treated aerobically by
   white-rot and soft-rot fungi. In this article, it is demonstrated that
   many fungi species can use digestion residues as a substrate. The
   soft-rot fungus Chaetomium cellulolyticum could aerobically degrade the
   digestion residues, measured as volatile solid reduction of 39\%. Within
   the process, lignin was reduced by almost 45\%. Exposed again to the
   digestion, these residues of the aerobic treatment were degraded
   anaerobically with a rate of 42\%. Therefore, a three-stage process
   combining anaerobic, aerobic and anaerobic degradation lends to organic
   matter reduction of more than 96\% of the original amount.
   It can be concluded at least that organic waste material can almost
   completely be mineralized by biotechnological treatment. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The Safe Drinking Water Act and its Amendments (SDWAA) may potentially
   limit each individual species of THM compounds in water distribution
   systems since the health risks associated with these species are not
   alike. A new approach to characterize and model the kinetics of THM
   species using nonlinear optimization was introduced in an earlier study.
   The approach combines site-specific water quality trends with
   stoichiometric expressions based on an average representative bromine
   content factor of the source. This paper incorporates the proposed
   kinetic approach in a full-dynamic water quality transport model. The
   model is capable of modeling chlorine, total THM, and the four THM
   species in water distribution systems subjected to different varying
   loading conditions. The model has been tested and verified by
   application to a portion of the Abu-Dhabi distribution system in the
   United Arab Emirates. High levels of bromoform and bromine incorporation
   factors were reported throughout the system. The quality trends of the
   bromide-rich desalinated water at the source were transmitted to
   different locations in the network using the proposed modeling approach.
   Overall agreement between the modeled and measured concentrations was
   reported. However, deviations at distant locations from the source
   indicate the degradation in the bromine incorporation factor under
   dynamic conditions and an increased tendency of the brominated THM
   compounds to hydrolyze. The model represents a useful and robust
   numerical tool to water utilities attempting to verify the SDWAA
   potential regulations regarding the THM species. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Copper sulfate (CuSO4) application to surface waters for nuisance algae
   central has been practised for decades, and the practice remains the
   most effective algicidal treatment for lakes, reservoirs and other
   managed water bodies. Despite its long history of use, questions remain
   about the fate of Cu in water bodies receiving CuSO4 treatment, and the
   forms and availability of Cu within surface waters subject to high Cu
   loadings. This study quantifies the tate of Cu following CuSO4 treatment
   to Lake Mathews, the terminal reservoir for the Colorado River Aqueduct
   and one of the sourer drinking water supply reservoirs for southern
   California, and evaluated the forms and kinetic lability of Cu in
   sediment samples. Based upon measured Cu concentrations, flows at the
   reservoir outlet, and known mass applied during treatment, mass balance
   calculations indicate that approximately 20\% of the Cu was exported
   from the reservoir over a 70-day period following an 8.85 metric ton
   CuSO4. 5H(2)O treatment on 23 October 1995. Rapid conversion of the
   dissolved Cu to particulate forms was observed, with significant
   accumulation of Cu in the sediments, Total sediment Cu contents ranged
   from approximately 10-600 mu g/g dry-weight basis and decreased with
   increasing depth within the sediments, qualitatively following known
   historical Cu inputs to the reservoir. Sequential extraction and
   desorption kinetic experiments suggest that a significant portion of the
   sediment-borne Cu is associated with oxidizable and carbonate-bound
   phases which may release Cu to the water column, although significant
   release would occur only under extreme changes in water chemistry. (C)

Abstract = {{In recent years attention has been drawn to various aspects related to
   the influence of disinfection by-products in distribution systems. The
   formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) and its species which form from the
   reaction of chlorine with humic substances have caused much alarm
   because of their carcinogenic and dangerous health effects. This article
   studies the factors affecting THM formation in pipelines transporting
   drinking water in the south of Bohemia in the Czech Republic. The
   residual chlorine in water entering these pipelines is in average 0.75
   mg l(-1) and decreases with distance until it reaches zero. The low
   velocity and the large volume of reservoirs increase the residence time
   and correspondingly provide conditions for more chlorine decay and
   accordingly an increase in THM formation. The effect of temperature and
   organic matters on THM formation was also studied in this article. The
   residence time and decay of chlorine were used as good predictors for
   the formation of THM and chloroform in this study. There was a linear
   correlation between the cumulative chlorine decay and the cumulative
   THMs formed in the pipelines with R-2 = 0.913. Meanwhile, the
   correlation between THM formation and residence lime was exponential
   with R-2 = 0.91. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The coupling effect between the oxygen mass transfer, due to a two-phase
   jet aerator and the recirculating how it generates when installed in a
   large vessel, is modelled using a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD)
   approach. A semi-infinite domain surrounding the jet aerator was built.
   Specific boundary conditions were applied in order to represent a
   uniform, oxygen free, transverse flow flushing the aerated zone. The
   motion of the gas phase was not taken into consideration and its
   influence on the motion of the liquid phase was neglected. The volume in
   which oxygen transfer occurs was restricted to a subpart of the domain
   and it was characterized by a uniform mass transfer coefficient K(L)a.
   The flow rate due to the aerator is 50 m(3) h(-1), that of the
   transverse current was varied from 700 to 3000 m(3) h(-1) and three
   values of K(L)a were investigated (360, 1000 and 3600 h(-1)). For each
   case, the Navier-Stokes equations were solved to compute the velocity
   fields. Numerical results proved to be in close agreement with published
   data of 3-D jets in a crossflow. The oxygen source term was then added
   and the transport equation was time integrated until a steady state was
   reached. It was demonstrated that the most influential parameter on the
   amount of oxygen transferred was the transverse flow rate. When low.
   modifying the K(L)a value has almost no effect, whereas at high how
   rates a tenfold increase in the K(L)a value only doubles the oxygen
   transfer value. An ideal reactor-based model was then used to analyse
   the results. The behaviour of the aerated zone was found to be close to
   that of a plug flow reactor. Numerical values of the net mass flux of
   oxygen are compatible with industrial reports (13 kgO(2) h(-1)) and our
   modelling was able to account for the differences between laboratory and
   full-scale experiments. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The piper procedure for particle size distribution of fluvial sediment
   was evaluated to determine if it can also be used as part of an approach
   for measuring concentration of contaminants on specific particle size
   fractions (e.g., clay, fine silt, coarse silt, and sand). Actual
   distributions of particle size and a contaminant (Cs-137) were
   represented by the results of a settling column procedure. These results
   were compared with results from the piper procedure. Particle size
   distribution results were similar for both procedures. To calculate the
   distribution of contaminant concentration on particle size fractions,
   two different approaches for analyzing information from the piper
   procedure were used. Results from one of these pipet-based analyses
   compared very well with the distribution of contaminant concentrations
   measured with the settling column procedure; the other analysis based on
   the piper data did not provide good results. The new procedure is
   especially useful for contaminated sediment applications. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Based on a conceptual neural fuzzy model developed for anaerobic
   treatment systems, a fast predicting neural fuzzy model was developed to
   predict the response of high-rate anaerobic systems to different system
   disturbances 1 h in advance. Thr model was applied to three laboratory
   scale systems, i.e. an anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR), an
   anaerobic filter (AF), and an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB)
   reactor. in all three cases, the model learned well from the training
   patterns and exhibited good and fast predictions for the performance of
   the three systems subjected to a twofold OLR together with two-fold HLR
   overload shock. It was proven that neural fuzzy modeling has great
   adaptability to the variations of system configuration and operation
   condition. The model is expected to have a great application potential
   in real time system control. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Microfiltration membranes used in drinking-water treatment are fouled by
   both colloidal material and natural organic matter (NOM) present in the
   raw water. The relative importance of these contributions to fouling may
   depend on whether or not the water is pretreated before microfiltration,
   and on the type and extent of any pretreatment. In this study, the
   causes of fouling were determined for microfiltration of a surface water
   through a polypropylene hollow-fibre membrane. Fouling was caused by
   colloidal material when the raw water was filtered untreated, and by NOM
   when the raw water was coagulated before filtration. The components of
   NOM which cause fouling of microfiltration membranes are not yet
   well-established, and were also investigated in this study. NOM from the
   raw water was fractionated into four specific classes of compounds on
   the basis of hydrophobicity and charge. The rates of fouling by each NOM
   fraction were measured separately. The major contribution to Fouling was
   attributed to the NOM fraction comprising small, neutral, hydrophilic
   compounds. The NOM fractions comprising humic and fulvic acids made only
   a minor contribution to fouling. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In order to develop a feasible technology for a safe ground water
   recharge with treated waste water, quality and characteristics of four
   different nanofiltration (NF) permeates were investigated for separation
   of organic constituents in the treated tertiary effluent. To avoid high
   fouling and scaling potentials during the membrane process, we also used
   NF membranes with larger pore size, and with a molecular weight cut-off
   (MWCO) in the range of several thousands g.mol(-1). Adsorption behavior
   on powdered activated carbon (PAC) of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   permeating through these membranes was significantly better than that of
   the feed waters (tertiary effluent and microfiltered tertiary effluent).
   A numerical analysis of the adsorption isotherm data according to the
   Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) confirmed these results. Size
   exclusion chromatography (SEC) proved that the reduction rate for
   adsorptive removal of DOC from NF permeates increases with decreasing
   molecular weight. In the feed water DOC adsorption on PAC is negatively
   influenced by humic substances (HS). As well as the adsorptive removal
   of DOC by PAC, soil aquifer treatment (SAT) showed similar DOC removal
   rates in the low molecular range and therefore offers a promising option
   by combining ``large pore{''} NF-membrane filtration with conventional
   SAT for more effective DOC removal with the aim of an artificial ground
   water recharge. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Thiobacillus thioparus THI115 utilizes thiocyanate as its sole source of
   energy for growth. Carbonyl sulfide (COS) was found as an intermediate
   in the headspace of a sealed flask during the degradation of
   thiocyanate, and ammonia and sulfate were produced as the final products
   which slightly decreased the medium pH. In a pH-controlled TC medium,
   the highest degradation activity for thiocyanate was obtained at pH 6.2
   and the activity was inhibited at pH 6.0. When whole gases in both
   liquid medium and headspace were removed from the culture vessel by
   forced aeration, neither growth of T. thioparus THI115 nor the
   degradation of thiocyanate could be observed. On the other hand,
   thiocyanate was degraded after a lag period of about 150 h when only the
   gases in the headspace were removed. These results suggest that the
   entire COS produced was easy to diffuse outside the cells and that the
   evolved COS was re-incorporated to be metabolized by cells. Despite the
   fact that CDS is toxic to organisms, thiocyanate degradation by T.
   thioparus THI115 was tolerated when a total of 500 mu mol of COS, which
   is about 17 times higher than the lethal dose of 50 for 90 min in rats,
   was added to the culture. T. thioparus THI115 degraded up to 60 mM
   thiocyanate in 130 h when supplied with sufficient oxygen and keeping
   the medium pH over 6.2. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The authors have proposed a novel membrane process where nitrifying
   bacteria are fixed on the surface of the rotating membrane disks. With
   this proposed membrane process, the simultaneous performance of the
   strict solid liquid separation and the oxidation of ammonia is enabled.
   In this study, three long-term experiments were carried out and the
   distribution of the filtration resistance and the efficient cleaning
   method of the proposed membrane process were investigated. The membrane
   Aux was fixed at 0.8 m(3)/m(2)/d and the feed ammonia concentration was
   controlled within the range of 0.1-1.0 mg-N/l. in the proposed membrane
   process, the filtration resistance caused by the accumulated cake was
   dominant. The shear-stress induced by the increased disk's rotational
   speed was found to be efficient for removing the accumulated cake,
   However, this cleaning method did not work well when feed water
   contained suspended particles at 10 of turbidity unit. In order to
   increase the cleaning efficiency, a small quantity of sponge particles
   were introduced into the membrane chamber and the disk's rotational
   speed was increased. This membrane cleaning method using sponge
   particles proved so effective that the filtration resistance due to the
   accumulated cake was completely cancelled. Membrane filtration could be
   continued for more than 3000 h due to the implementation of this
   cleaning method utilizing sponge particles once every 1000-1500 h. For
   the maintenance of the ammonia oxidation rate, however, a part of the
   detached nitrifiers had to be returned to the membrane chamber after the
   membrane cleaning. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tilapia were exposed to sediment and water contaminated with PCBs in the

   sediment and river sediment accumulated significantly higher levels of
   PCBs (27.5 and 3.9 mu g/g lipids, respectively) than those exposed to
   contaminated water (1.6 mu g/g lipid). The biota-sediment accumulation
   factors (BSAFs) of PCBs domains were less than 2.5. PCBs congeners
   containing four to six chlorine atoms on the biphenyl rings showed a
   relatively higher accumulation potential. Minor effects of lipid
   contents, weight and length of fish were observed on PCBs accumulation.

Abstract = {{We verified the usefulness of water quality indices (WQI) to assess the
   water quality from multiple measured parameters, and to evaluate spatial
   and temporal changes. Measured parameters include many of those
   recommended by the GEMS/Water UNEP program. Two WQI (subjective and
   objective-WQI(sub) and WQI(obj)) take into consideration 20 parameters.
   Another index (minimal-WQI(min)) was developed considering only three
   parameters: turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and either conductivity or
   dissolved solids. WQI(sub) tends to overestimate the pollution due to
   the use of a subjective constant, which is not necessarily correlated
   with the measured parameters. WQI(min) shows a similar trend to WQI(sub)
   and WQI(obj) at a lower analytical cost; however, it should be combined
   with WQI(obj) to corroborate the results. The use of WQI could be of
   particular interest for developing countries, because they provide
   cost-effective water quality assessment as well as the possibility of
   evaluating trends. As a case study, we report on the use of WQI to
   evaluate spatial and seasonal changes in the water quality from the
   Suquia River in Cordoba City (Argentina) and nearby locations. The city
   urban activity produces a serious and negative effect on the water
   quality; this is particularly severe in locations following the city
   sewage discharge. The dry season shows the worst water quality. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{This work focuses on the development, characterization and evaluation of
   the TiO(2) Rotating Disk Photocatalytic Reactor (RDPR) for the treatment
   of organic pollutants in water. A commercial TiO(2)-based catalyst in
   the Form of composite ceramic balls was used as the immobilized
   photocatalyst on the rotating disk. LiCl tracer studies conducted at
   different disk angular velocities, ranging from 20 to 5 rpm, proved that
   the mixing in the RDPR is close to that of an ideal CSTR. Two different
   techniques, an overflow method and the potassium ferrioxalate
   actinometry method were employed for determining the liquid holdup and
   turnover time of the rotating disk with glass beads substituted for
   TiO(2) coated beads. The two methods were in agreement and only the
   overflow method was employed for determining the same parameters for the
   rotating disk when loaded with TiO(2) composite ceramic balls. Power law
   correlations were obtained in all cases. TiO(2)-assisted photocatalytic
   degradation of 4-chlorobenzoic acid (4-CBA) was investigated in the RDPR
   at a specified angular velocity of the rotating disk (4 rpm), initial pH
   = 3.0, and room temperature using near-UV radiation. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A big fertilizer industrial complex and a vast extension of
   phosphogypsum piles (12 km(2)), sited in the estuary formed by the Odiel
   and Tinto river mouths (south-west of Spain), are producing an
   unambiguous radioactive impact in their sourrounding aquatic
   environment, through radionuclides from the U-series. The levels and
   distribution of radionuclides in the different water phases of this
   estuarine system (filtered and particulate fractions) have been
   determined. The analyses of radionuclide concentrations and activity
   ratios have provided us with interesting information with which to
   evaluate the extension, degree and routes of the radioactive impact, as
   well with the knowledge of the different pathways followed for the
   radioactive contamination which disturbs this natural system. The
   obtained results indicate that the main pathway of radioactive
   contamination of the estuary is through the dissolution in its waters of
   the radionuclides released by the industrial activities and their later
   fixation on the particulate materials. On the other hand, the tidal
   activity plays an important role in the transport and homogeneization
   along the estuary of the radioactivity released from the fertilizer
   plants. Additionally, the results obtained for the different studied
   natural radionuclides (U-isotopes, Th-isotopes and Po-210) in the
   filtered and particulate fractions have provided very rich information
   about their different environmental behaviour in this aquatic system.

   metal ion sorption obeyed both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms.
   Experiments by mixed solutions showed that more Cr3+ ions were removed
   than both Cd2+ and Zn2+ ions. The binding capacities acid the affinities
   observed were consistent with the HSAB theory on hard and soft acid
   base. The Cr(VI) removal was pH dependent and fitted with the Langmuir
   isotherm model. It was proceeding effectively into a short acid pH
   interval (2.5-3.5) where both processes of Cr (VI) reduction and (Cr
   III) sorption are maximized. Mechanisms for removal of anions and
   cations studied have been proposed. The observed sorption data showed
   similarity with that of other fresh cellulosic materials found in
   literature. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of ozone oxidation in the removal of
   3,4-dichlorobut-1-ene (3,4 DCB), a contaminant often present in the
   aqueous effluents generated by synthetic rubber processes, was studied.
   Ozone oxidation removed 3,4 DCB completely from the model solutions with
   initial concentrations ranging from 4 to 64 mg/l over a maximum
   ozonation time of 7 min. The complete oxidation of 3,4 DCB was mainly
   due to the direct reaction with ozone molecules at acidic and neutral
   pH. At alkaline pH ozone oxidation only reduced the 3,4 DCB
   concentration by 61\% over 15 min of ozonation. Methanol used in
   preparing the 3,4 DCB solutions did not affect the ozone oxidation rate.
   Ozone oxidation of a 3,4 DCB/methanol solution with an initial 3,4 DCB
   concentration of 120 mg/l reduced 95\% of the 3,4 DCB concentration but
   only 4\% of the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) in the solution. The high
   COD value in the ozonated solution was probably due to the presence of
   methanol. Ozone degraded 3,4 DCB and chloroprene (CD) in the effluent
   samples from a synthetic rubber processing plant and resulted in the
   maximal reduction of the COD by 45\%. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this paper a detailed experimental and theoretical analysis of the
   adsorption process of mercury by ion exchange resins is presented.
   Experiments have been performed to study adsorption efficiency, the
   effect of pH on the uptake of mercury and the adsorption kinetics. The
   experimental apparatus was a batch mechanically stirred reactor (volume
   1.5 dm(3)), under almost isothermal conditions (+/-0.1 degrees C). The
   resin used in this study is Duolite GT-73, a chelating resin,
   macroreticular with thiol (S-H) functional groups. The studied resin has
   a very high adsorption efficiency, reaching 30-40\% in weight and the
   efficiency decreases, decreasing pH, due to competition between ions H+
   and Hg2+. Such a high efficiency confirms previous results and justifies
   the great interest for the application of ion exchange resins in water
   treatment plants. As in previous works, measurements of process kinetics
   show that the adsorption rate decreases as the initial mercury
   concentration is increased. This fact suggests that intraparticle
   diffusion rate can be the controlling step for the adsorption process.
   To verify this, a simplified mathematical model has been identified,
   accounting for a diffusional resistance inside solid particles and where
   the equilibrium relationship between Hg concentration in the liquid and
   in the solid is described by the. Freundlich isotherm, neglecting H+
   competition: this model is very effective in the prediction of the
   change in the adsorption kinetics with the initial Hg concentration.
   Hence this preliminary approach can be held as the reference starting
   point for the adsorption model: further developments will concern the
   equilibrium thermodynamics (H+ competition). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Riga, the capital of Latvia, is surrounded by several lakes. Being
   domestic and industrial wastewater recipients, these lakes are
   eutrophic. One of them, Lake Mazais Baltezers is used for artificial
   recharge of the groundwater (Quaternary aquifer) through infiltration
   basins. The water quality of this lake is crucial as the groundwater is
   eventually used as a source of drinking water. important cyanobacterial
   blooms occurred in this lake at the end of summer. These blooms were
   toxic and microcystin-LR was analysed in the algal biomass. Microcystins
   were analysed using protein phosphatase inhibition assay and
   high-performance liquid chromatography. Toxins were analysed in surface
   water samples as well as drinking water samples to assess the soil
   cleaning efficiency. This study showed that the Lake Mazais Baltezers
   was vulnerable due to human activities and its water quality could vary
   quickly due to cyanobacteria. The soil of this area was not efficient
   enough to protect the groundwater and the drinking water from toxins
   during the blooming period (August-September) and it appeared that
   toxins were not degraded in the soil, which is a cause of concern since
   the consumption of sub-acute levels may be deleterious to human health.
   The toxin concentrations indicated that, in the future, the water source
   should be monitored and that measures should be introduced to control
   blooms and to remove toxins from the water. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The aqueous phase adsorption of methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and
   tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) onto an Amberlite resin at 20 degrees C was
   investigated under different operating conditions. To this end, both
   batch and fixed-bed experiments were performed on single solute and
   bisolute mixtures, The single-solute equilibrium data were fitted by
   means of the Freundlich equation and isotherm parameters were
   determined. The data on bisolute adsorption showed a strong competitive
   effect between MTBE and TEA, which can be described by means of a
   theoretical model accounting for the non-ideal behaviour of adsorbed
   phase. Experimental breakthrough curves were determined for
   single-solute solutions in order to evaluate the overall mass transfer
   coefficients bt tween liquid and adsorbed phases. A predictive model for
   multisolute fixed-bed adsorption is proposed and the theoretical results
   are compared with experimental data. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   experimental period respiratory quotient and activities of enzymes
   Isocitrate dehydrogenase, Succinic dehydrogenase and Lactate
   dehydrogenase were investigated at regular intervals. Gill histology was
   studied from control and experimental fish at the end of 28 days and
   after the depuration period. Cyprinus carpio cultured in secondary
   sewage effluent revealed starvation and histopathological changes in the
   gill structure which was less extensive in well-fed Oreochromis
   mossambicus. Study of correlation coefficients between respiratory
   quotient and oxidative enzymes indicate use of aerobic and anerobic
   pathways in control fish. This relationship was reversed during exposure
   in both the fish and normalcy was regained during depuration in Cyprinus
   carpio but not in Oreochromis mossambicus as they continued to show
   depressed activity of oxidative enzymes. To summarise, the fish under
   investigation behaved differently when exposed to secondary sewage
   effluent and during depuration. But the responses suggest against the
   use of secondary sewage effluent as a culture medium for these fish. (C)

Abstract = {{2,4,6-trimercaptotriazine. trisodium salt, nonahydrate (TMT-55) is a
   planar C-3 symmetric compound that is used commercially to precipitate
   mercury and other heavy metals from waste waters and contaminated
   natural waters. A series of laboratory experiments and analyses were
   performed to evaluate the chemistry and stability of mercury
   trimercaptotriazine ``Hg-TMT{''} precipitates that result from the
   addition of aqueous solutions of TMT-55 to aqueous solutions of
   mercury(II) chloride (HgCl2). Several Hg-TMT species exist, most of
   which were previously unrecognized. The leaching properties, chemistry
   and long-term stability of the solids are very diverse. As examples, the
   white and yellow varieties of Hg-TMT are often unstable in both water
   and air, and may release more than 6000 mu g/l of mercury into distilled
   and deionized water leachates. Although waste waters and contaminated
   ground waters are likely to contain less mercury than the HgCl2
   solutions used in this study, individuals should recognize that any
   Hg-TMT compounds are likely to be chemically complex and perhaps
   unstable under aqueous or atmospheric conditions. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Toluene dioxygenase (TDO) in Pseudomonas putida F1 (PpF1) was used as a
   model to determine if enzymes that initiate aerobic BTEX degradation can
   be expressed at very low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. Emphasis
   was placed on characterizing how the DO concentration during induction
   affects the level of enzyme expression. TDO was expressed at similar
   levels in PpF1 cells induced on toluene at different DO concentrations
   (ca. 1, 4, and 8 mg L-1). TDO activity decayed exponentially with cell
   age at 0.25 0.48 day(-1). Nevertheless, the DO concentration during
   induction did not significantly affect TDO expression or longevity. PpF1
   also grew on toluene at 0.1 mg L-1 DO, showing that TDO can be expressed
   at very low DO levels. This suggests that aerobic biotransformations are
   likely to contribute to BTX bioremediation even when an aerotolerant
   anaerobic respiration mode (e.g., denitrification) is prevalent, (C)

Abstract = {{Sediment-containing water samples, collected From aquatic environments
   where no significant selenium pollution was observed, were examined for
   selenate and selenite reduction potentials. All seven samples tested
   exhibited selenate and selenite reduction capability to a certain degree
   under micro-aerobic and anaerobic conditions. There was a general
   tendency that the selenite reduction proceeded more rapidly and
   extensively than the selenate reduction. During the selenate reduction
   by the aquatic samples, no accumulation of selenite was observed, but a
   red precipitate indicating the presence of elemental selenium was
   formed. Enrichment of selenate-reducing bacteria was successfully
   performed only from two samples under a micro-aerobic condition, while
   the trials from the other samples resulted in failure. Three different
   selenate-reducing bacteria, strains FR-1, FK-2 and FK-121, were isolated
   from the enrichment cultures. The former two strains were identified as
   Pseudomonas stutzeri and the other one as Pseudomonas fluorescens. They
   could reductively transform up to 5 mM selenate into selenite under
   anaerobic conditions. During the selenate reduction, selenite was nearly
   stoichiometrically accumulated, and a small portion was further reduced
   into insoluble selenium. presence of air delayed or inhibited their
   selenate reduction. Their selenite-reducing activities were not
   efficient, and higher concentration of selenite (>2 mM) completely or
   mostly inhibited their selenite-reducing activity. The selenate-reducing
   activities of these strains were much lower than those of previously
   reported selenate-reducing bacteria which were isolated from Se-polluted
   or -rich environment. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   APCI-MS revealed the release of four polyphenols exhibiting growth
   inhibition effects, i.e., ellagic, gallic and pyrogallic acids and
   (+)-catechin. A quantitative investigation of their respective
   inhibitory effects showed that gallic and pyrogallic acids are more
   inhibitory than (+)-catechin and ellagic acid, and that the autoxidized
   products of each polyphenol demonstrated growth inhibition. Finally,
   when the collective activity of a mixture of the polyphenols was
   examined, synergistic growth inhibition of M. aeruginosa occurred. (C)

Abstract = {{The possibility to fix phosphate in sludge handling liquors supplied
   from a carbon-nitrogen wastewater treatment plant through the
   crystallization of struvite was investigated in this paper. The
   anaerobic supernatant used for the experiments was obtained from the
   dewatering section (belt-press) of a 85000 equivalent inhabitants civil
   wastewater treatment plant, with a combined carbon oxidation and
   nitrogen nitrification-denitrification and anaerobic digestion of
   sludge. The experimental results showed that a natural aging with
   phosphate precipitation can be observed in a few days with a different
   percentage of struvite and hydroxyapatite in relation to the liquor
   composition; moreover supersaturation curves play a major role in the
   interpretation ol the process. Finally, the FBR plant managed in batch
   mode assures a good phosphate removal through crystallization on quartz
   sand in about 100 min. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Many researches have demonstrated that the use of biological processes
   in the production of drinking water has many advantages over
   conventional alternatives. One possibility is that biological processes
   will result in lower levels of genotoxic by-products in the drinking
   water. This possibility was investigated in the present study, which
   compares the levels of such by-products following either chemical or
   biological treatments. Water samples, collected at the main steps of the
   two key stages of both treatments were passed over XAD2/8 resins, to
   concentrate micropollutants, included by-products, for subsequent
   analysis using the microsome/Salmonella assay (TA98 and TA100 +/- S9).
   The results showed that biological treatment, avoiding break-point
   chlorination, limits by-product formation and associated mutagenic
   generation. It follows that, in this respect, biological processes seem
   to have significant advantages over conventional water treatments. (C)

Abstract = {{Cluster analysis was applied to identify granulometric similarities
   between sediment samples from a heavily contaminated semi-enclosed bay
   (the Kastela Bay in the Middle Adriatic). Concentrations of Mn, Cr, Pb,
   Cd and organic matter were determined in four grain-size fractions (A, >
   300 mu m; B, 54-300 mu m; C, 20-54 mu m; and D, < 20 mu m) of the
   sediment samples. The finest sediment fractions (C and D) contained the
   highest concentrations of Cr, Pb and organic matter. The concentrations
   of these metals were generally four times greater than in coarse
   grained-fractions. Cadmium is also accumulated in less extent in
   fine-grain fractions, while Mn distribution was quite irregular. The
   vertical distribution of the studied trace metals shows Pb enrichment in
   upper sediment layers, while Cd concentration was increased only in the
   samples from the most polluted part of the Bay. This indicates
   anthropogenic origins of these metals. Principal Component Analysis was
   used to interpret the variations of trace metals and organic matter
   concentrations in the sediment samples. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to study the fate of toluene, acetone
   and 1,2- dichloroethane (DCA) in refuse excavated from a municipal solid
   waste landfill contaminated with organic solvents. Refuse excavated from
   the landfill was used to fill multiple 8-1 simulated landfill reactors
   that were operated with and without moisture addition to simulate the
   absence and presence of an engineered cover, respectively. An average of
   31.3\% of the added C-14-toluene was converted to (CH4)-C-14 and
   (CO2)-C-14 in reactors that received water additions, while only 12\%
   was mineralized in the absence of water addition. Up to 30\% of the
   added C-14 was recovered in humic and fulvic acid fractions and up to
   12\% of the C-14 was not extractable with dichloromethane (DCM) followed
   by 0.5 N NaOH. The non-extractable fraction may represent strongly
   sorbed toluene or toluene metabolites covalently bound to humins. From
   21.6 to 40.3\% of the added C-14-acetone was converted to (CH4)-C-14 and
   (CO2)-C-14 although there was no consistent effect associated with
   water. This is likely explained by the high solubility of acetone as
   considerably more acetone was present in the reactor leachate relative
   to toluene. Reductive dehalogenation of 1,2-DCA to ethylene was measured
   in all reactors. This study suggests that remediation activities
   designed to reduce moisture infiltration could adversely affect
   contaminant biodegradation at the source and that moisture infiltration
   must be balanced against the potential increase in contaminant release
   due to leaching. Further, the association with humic matter in
   decomposed refuse may represent an alternative mechanism for contaminant
   sequestration. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Incorporation of human hygiene water (graywater) into hydroponic plant
   production systems, and subsequent recovery of the water transpired by
   the plants, is one potential means for water purification and recycling
   in bioregenerative life support systems under development for long
   duration space missions. Surfactant phytotoxicity and the potential for
   growth of human-associated microorganisms were assessed in studies of
   wheat and lettuce in controlled environmental chambers to provide
   baseline information for future studies with actual graywater streams.
   Igepon TC-42 (sodium N-coconut acid-N-methyl taurate), a surfactant
   designated for use on the International Space Station and a common
   ingredient of soaps and detergents, was added to plant systems in three
   different modes: (1) pulse addition of 875 mg m(-2) growing area once a
   day, (2) continuous addition of 875 mg m(-2) over the course of a day,
   and (3) variable addition of 0-3000 mg m(-2) d(-1) based on plant water
   demand. The survival of three human-associated bacteria (Escherichia
   coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in the plant
   nutrient delivery systems were monitored following introduction 6
   (wheat) or 3 (lettuce) days after planting (DAP). Igepon rapidly
   disappeared (i.e., a half-life of less than 1 h) following an initial
   adaptation period lasting less than 2 days. Microbial degradation of
   Igepon was supported by appearance of the degradation intermediate
   methyl taurine and an increase in the numbers of bacteria able to grow
   on media containing Igepon as the sole carbon source in the Igepon
   treated systems relative to the control. Wheat growth was not
   significantly affected by any of the Igepon treatments, but lettuce
   yield was significantly reduced in the pulse and continuous treatments.
   E. coli and S. aureus decreased below detection limits within 3-5 days
   within the systems, but P. aeruginosa persisted in the rhizosphere,
   nutrient solution, and nutrient delivery system biofilm for the duration
   of the wheat (70-day) and lettuce (28-day) experiments. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{An improved mathematical model of anaerobic digestion in a sequencing
   batch reactor (SBR) process is developed. The model simulates the
   interactions between the biological, liquid (physicochemical) and gas
   phases. These phenomena are supported by experimental data. The advanced
   model assumes: (1) six populations of bacteria, including two
   populations of acetoclastic bacteria, are present in the bioreactor; (2)
   hydrogen in the gaseous phase is not in equilibrium with dissolved
   hydrogen; (3) production of volatile fatty acids (VFA) is regulated by
   the concentration of hydrogen in the liquid phase; and (4) the process
   is not affected by large concentrations of VFA and ammonia. The model
   contains a large number of kinetic constants and has the capability to
   predict the pH and methane production, as well as the concentrations of
   acetic (Ac), propionic (Pr) and butyric (Bu) acids; dissolved and
   gaseous hydrogen and soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) in the SBR as
   a function of time. The model coefficients were determined for data,
   gathered from pilot scale digesters operated under psychrophilic
   conditions. The calibrated model was able to simulate methane
   production, SCOD, Ac and Pr acid concentrations in the dynamic
   conditions of an SBR, operated over a range of operating conditions. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, experimental data are presented to test and to validate a
   kinetic model for the oxidation of organic compound in dilute aqueous
   solution by the Fe(III)/H2O2 process in a batch reactor (NaClO4/HClO4
   solutions, Ionic strength: I = 0.1 M, pH less than or equal to 3.0, 25.0
   degrees C). Atrazine was used as a model compound. Under the conditions
   employed in this study ({[}Atrazine](o) < 1 mu M), the OH radical was
   the unique species responsible for the oxidation of atrazine.
   Propagation and termination reactions involving organic radicals were
   assumed to be of little importance and were not incorporated in the
   model. The data showed that the effects of pH (pH range: 1-3) and of the
   concentrations of reactants ({[}H2O2](o) and {[}Fe(III)](o)) on the
   rates of oxidation of atrazine and of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide
   were in good agreement with model predictions. The concentration-time
   profiles for transient species (Fe(II), HO2./O-2(.-); and OH. radicals)
   obtained by computer calculations were also useful to explain the lag
   period and the pseudo-first order decay which were observed on the
   experimental kinetic curves of degradation of atrazine (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Titanium nitride (TiN) is a biocompatible material and has very low
   electrical resistance. Electrochemical control of pathogenic microbes
   derived from a drinking water distribution system was investigated using
   a TiN electrode. When a potential of 1.2 V vs saturated calomel
   electrode (SCE) was applied, the survival ratio of microorganisms
   decreased to below 40\%. Changes in pH were not observed at 1.2 V vs
   SCE. Also, by applying -0.6 V vs SCE for 30 min, 69\% of cells on the
   electrode surface were detached by the electrostatic repulsion.
   Therefore, an electrochemical disinfection reactor using a TiN mesh as
   the working electrode and the counter electrode was constructed. The
   drinking water containing mean viable cell concentration of 73 cells/ml
   was continuously passed through the reactor at a flow rate of 15 ml/min.
   The viable cell concentration in treated water decreased to below 5
   cells/ml. When no potential was applied, cell concentration in treated
   water gradually increased after 200 h of reactor operation. In contrast,
   when alternating potentials of 1.2 and -0.6 V vs silver/silver chloride
   (Ag/AgCl) were applied to the TiN mesh working electrode, the viable
   cell concentration remained below 100 cells/ml during a 440 h operation.
   The reactor for drinking water disinfection incorporated with the TiN
   mesh electrode worked effectively by applying alternating potentials of
   1.2 and -0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Fractionated Al-pillared (code name AZA) and Fe-Al-pillared (code name
   FAZA) clays and mesoporous alumina aluminum phosphates (AAPs) were
   contacted with aqueous, atrazine, propazine, prometryne, propachlor,
   propanil and molinate solutions at a concentration range of between 1
   and 20 mg/l, in batch equilibrium experiments in order to determine
   their adsorption properties. The pillared clays showed an improved
   affinity which allowed the adsorption of the studied herbicides to occur
   much more efficiently than in the case of AAPs. The removed amounts of
   the studied herbicides by using the pillared clay materials reached
   95.3\% for atrazine, 92.2\% for propazine, 98.5\% for prometryne, 60.9\%
   for propachlor, 86.8\% for propanil and 70.2\% for molinate. The iron
   substitution in FAZA pillared clay did not show great differences in
   adsorption capacity. The adsorption of s-triazines on mesoporous AAPs
   decreased with the alkyl substitution of the lateral chains, thus
   atrazine was the most adsorbed compound. The removal of propachlor by
   AAPs decreased with the increase of P/Al ratio. The material with P/Al =
   0.4 ratio was more efficient for the removal of molinate and propanil.
   The amounts of herbicides decomposed during the treatment were higher
   for AAPs in comparison with those for AZA and FAZA. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A program of oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE) measurements using offgas
   analysis at the Tillman Water Reclamation Plant (TWRP) in Los Angeles
   has provided thorough documentation of the performance of fine-pore
   diffusers in an activated sludge plant. From 1991 to 1993, measurements
   were made in a uniform pattern that avoided both the ends of the
   aeration grids and the main pipes along the grid centerlines, which were
   more likely to be the locations of leaks that could bias the overall
   average efficiency estimates toward low values. This pattern was chosen
   in part because of the limited time available during these measurement
   sessions. When measurements were resumed in 1997 with additional
   resources, it was decided that several alternatives in sampling should
   be investigated.
   First, to assess-the significance of the contributions of areas that
   previously had been avoided, a much more thorough coverage was
   performed. Second, a new ``longitudinal{''} sampling scheme was tested,
   as an alternative to the ``transverse{''} approach that had been used
   previously. This method not only allows making larger numbers of
   measurements within a similar time, but provides separate results for
   the left and right sides of a tank. Measurements were also made with the
   hood in fixed positions for periods of several hours, to check
   measurement stability and diurnal variation. In addition to the offgas
   measurements, data on plant operation were recorded from the field
   instruments and the control room.
   The data show enhanced efficiencies near the upstream and downstream
   ends of the grids, and in the areas beyond the ends of the grids. This
   is at least partly the result of known variations in diffuser fouling,
   resulting from air flows in the distribution pipes. The longitudinal
   results show an apparent left-right asymmetry, but this turns out to be
   an artifact, caused by changing air flows during the measurement
   session, as shown by the control room data. In the fixed position
   measurements, variability of several percentage points was observed on
   relatively short time scales. The plant data also corroborated most of
   the air flux from the offgas instrument.
   These observations show the results of going beyond the EPA
   recommendation to collect offgas from at least 2\% of the surface of an
   aeration basin, particularly when the measurements are planned according
   to the structure of the air distribution system of the tank. They are
   steps toward enhancing the importance of OTE monitoring as an input to
   decisions to clean or repair aeration systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A quantitative estimation of direct ozonation and indirect free radical
   oxidation of dyes with assorted chromophores was studied through the
   examination of reaction kinetics in the ozonation process. The reaction
   kinetics of dye ozonation under different conditions was determined by
   adjusting the ozone doses, dye concentration, and reaction pH. The
   ozonation of dyes was found dominant by pseudo-first-order reaction, and
   the rate constants decreased as the dye/ozone ratio increased. For all
   selected azo dyes, the dye decay rates increased as the initial pH of
   the solution increased, yet the decay rates of anthraquinone dyes would
   decrease in the same situation because of their insensible structure for
   ozone oxidation, formation of leuco-form, and higher solubility at a
   lower pH. The ozonation of dyes at a high pH contributed by hydroxyl
   free radicals was qualitatively verified by the use of a free radical
   scavenger. A proposed model, in another way, quantitatively determines
   the fraction of contribution for dye decomposition between free radical
   oxidation and direct ozonation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The Tablas de Daimiel National Park is a Spanish continental wetland
   which is extremely important for the survival of many migratory birds.
   However, it is an ecosystem seriously threatened to a point that a
   Hydric Regeneration Plan was implemented in 1988 to restore this
   wetland, it has caused a situation of dependence for the use and
   management of water resources. The aim of this paper was to try to
   establish how the last years of artificial management have affected this
   ecosystem. To carry out this study we have analysed the water
   physico-chemical characteristics during the period 1995-1997 and these
   data have been compared with those obtained from a survey in 1974-1975,
   which represent the original situation. Different statistical techniques
   have been used for this purpose. A serious salinization process, which
   can affect the life in this wetland, has been pointed out. The present
   state of pollution, both organic and inorganic, has been evaluated.
   Trace metals data are reported for the first time. The global quality
   state has been established by using statistical quality indexes. (C)

Abstract = {{Living cells of a strain of Sphaerotilus natans are employed to remove
   Cr(III) from acid wastewater. Batch experiments carried out at starting
   acid conditions (pH 3.0-3.5) show that the pH progressively increases
   but the removing activity Starts only when conditions closed to
   neutrality are reached. Studies carried out either at initial acid
   conditions or at standard conditions for this micro-organism (pH 7.0)
   confirm that the biomass is able to grow also on acid medium, although
   the lag phase is longer than the one observed at standard conditions.
   This strain shows its maximum ability to remove Cr(III) at a biomass
   concentration of about 0.4 g l(-1) Tests carried out at both lower and
   higher biomass levels show lower yields, while the time necessary to
   reach the maximum removal considerably increases. Biomass previously
   adapted to acid conditions ensures a specific uptake of this metal of
   120 mg g(-1), which is much higher than that reported in the literature
   for other micro-organisms. Continuous tests in CSTR confirm the
   possibility of developing a biological treatment process for the
   continuous removal of Cr(III) from acid solutions. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The biosorption of Cu, Zn, Cd and Fe from multicomponent mixtures was
   studied in a flow-through column packed with Sargassum algal biosorbent
   in the Ca-form. The effects of competitive ion exchange such as the
   elution order of toxic metals from the column, and the concentration
   overshoots in column effluent were investigated both experimentally and
   by means of an ion exchange equilibrium column model (ECM). The ECM
   predicted, and the experiments confirmed, that from the feed containing
   Cu2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+, zinc broke through the column first, followed by
   cadmium and copper. When the binary mixtures containing 30 mg/l of Cu2+
   and 4 mg/l of either Cd2+ or Zn2+ were passed through the column, the
   concentrations of Zn and Cd ions in the column effluent overshot the 4
   mg/l feed concentration. The time interval between the overshoot of Zn
   and the breakthrough point of Cu was Significantly longer than that
   between the overshoot of Cd and the breakthrough point of Cu. However,
   Zn did not overshoot when the feed contained 50 mg/l of Cd and 4 mg/l of
   Zn. The ECM successfully predicted both the occurrence and the magnitude
   of the overshoots. The service time of a column treating multimetal
   mixtures was successfully predicted by combining the ECM with a mass
   transfer column model (MTCM). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The reactivity of hypoiodous acid (HOI) is an important factor for the
   fate of iodine in oxidative drinking water treatment. The possible
   reactions of HOI are its disproportionation, its oxidation to iodate
   (IO3-), or the reaction with natural organic matter (NOM). The latter
   reaction may result in the formation of iodoorganic compounds which are
   frequently responsible for taste and odor problems. The acid
   dissociation constant (pK(a)) of HOI has been determined
   spectrophotometrically as 10.4 +/- 0.1 (T = 25 degrees C; I = 50 mM).
   Kinetic constants and a new rate law for the disproportionation of HOI
   as catalyzed by hydrogencarbonate, carbonate, and berate are presented.
   In the pH range 7.6- 11.1, the main uncatalyzed reactions are HOI + HOI
   (k(1) = 0.3 M-1 s(-1)) and HOI + OI- (k(2) = 15 M-1 s(-1)). The
   buffer-catalyzed reaction step was found to be second-order in HOI and
   first-order in the buffer anion. The following rate constants were
   deduced: HOI + HOI + HCO3-: 50 M-2 s(-1): HOI + HOI + CO32-: 5000 M-2
   s(-1); HOI + HOI + B(OH)(4)(-): 1700 M-2 s(-1). All these rate constants
   result in half-lifes for HOI of 10-1000 days under typical drinking
   water conditions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3204-3212}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Production of excess biomass during biological treatment of wastewaters
   requires costly disposal. Also with environmental and legislative
   constraints limiting disposal options, considerable impetus exists for
   reducing the amount of biomass produced. Uncoupling metabolism in
   activated sludge may reduce biomass production and this approach is
   investigated in conjunction with consequences upon substrate removal and
   population dynamics. To induce uncoupled metabolism, para-nitrophenol
   (pNP) a known protonphoric uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, was
   introduced to a bench-scale activated sludge process. Microbial
   populations were monitored by both microscopic and by three methods of
   molecular analyses. Presence of the protonphore caused a shift in the
   microbial population with protozoa being washed out of the system and
   filamentous bacteria proliferating. The molecular composition of the
   microbial community was determined by PCR amplification of 16SrRNA genes
   and subsequent denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Band
   Patterns obtained by both a direct and nested approach were similar.
   However, profiles derived from nested PCR contained more bands,
   indicative of the increased sensitivity of this approach. Analysis of
   the active biomass by Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE) of small
   molecular weight RNA (5mwRNA) showed that a sustained shift in the
   diversity of the predominant, metabolically active species present
   occurred within two days of the introduction of the protonphore. Biomass
   production was reduced by 49\%, but the total substrate removal rate was
   also reduced by 25\%. The combined effect was a 30\% decrease in the
   biomass yield. Introduction of the protonphore caused substrate removal
   efficiency to decrease from a consistent value of 96\% to 68.5\% with
   considerable variance. This decline in overall process performance was
   attributed to a surmountable effect arising from the design of apparatus
   that resulted in a decrease in the reactor biomass concentration.
   Although the specific biomass volume was consistent throughout,
   decreased sedimentation resulted in solids being removed in the final
   effluent which decreased the amount of biomass which could be recycled.
   The catalytic efficiency of the biomass increased as reflected by a 3.3
   fold increase in the specific substrate uptake rate. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The River Seine downstream from Paris receives large amounts of ammonium
   (about 200 mu mol/l) from treated and untreated wastewater effluents. In
   such large river systems, due to the slow growth of nitrifying bacteria,
   the small size of the nitrifying population present in the water column
   often represents the limiting factor for nitrification of the
   contaminating ammonium. In this work we demonstrate that discharge of
   urban effluents can represent an important seeding of nitrifying
   bacteria, influencing the dynamics of nitrification in the river
   downstream. A nitrifying bacteria biomass in wastewater was deduced from
   (HCO3-)-C-14 potential nitrifying activity measurements. these were

Abstract = {{Inorganic arsenic and phosphate distributions have been studied in the
   acidic mixing zone of the Tinto river in November 1996, June 1997, and
   April 1998. This mixing zone receives high inputs of As, PO43- and Fe in
   relation with acid mine drainage and run-off from phosphogypsum waste.
   In the early stage of mixing the dissolution of detritic Fe phases
   (pyrite and oxides) releases Fe and As to water. This process is
   counterbalanced by removal due to precipitation of Fe-oxides and
   Fe-organic complexes and algae fixation. In autumn, the amount of algae
   is negligible and a release of As, Fe and PO43- to the dissolved phase
   was observed. As a consequence, high As and PO43- concentrations are
   registered in the water (up to 43 nM for As and 330 mu M for PO43-). In
   spring, the removal dominates in relation with high algae productivity.
   As a result As and PO43- are depleted in the dissolved phase in spring
   compared to autumn and high concentrations of As (up to 1530 mu g g(-1)
   and 700 mu g g(-1) in June and in April, respectively) were observed in
   the suspended particulate matter. In autumn dissolved As is correlated
   with Fe whilst in spring As behaves in a similar way as PO43-. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Microbial destruction of highly chlorinated organic compounds must be
   initiated by anaerobic followed by aerobic dechlorination. In-situ
   dechlorination of vadose zone soil contaminated with these compounds
   requires, among other factors, the establishment of highly reductive
   anaerobic conditions in the unsaturated subsurface. Such conditions may
   be established by delivering appropriate gas mixtures to the subsurface,
   i.e., ``anaerobic bioventing{''}. The gas must include an electron
   donor. This study was conducted as a feasibility study for anaerobic
   bioventing, using tetrachloroethene (PCE) as a test contaminant and H-2
   as the electron donor. Using a soil column inoculated with anaerobic
   dechlorinating bacteria, to simulate the vadose zone, experimental
   results showed that by passing a gas composed of 1\% H-2 and >0.1\% CO2
   in N-2, methanogenic conditions were established and that PCE (fed as a
   vapor in the gas stream) was rapidly converted with terminal products
   vinyl chloride (VC) and trans-dichloroethene (trans-DCE). PCE half life
   in the column was 7 min, while parameter estimation yielded a first
   order PCE degradation rate k(PCE), of 0.098 min(-1). Intermediate
   products detected but not accumulated in the column were
   trichloroethylene (TCE) and cis-dichloroethene (cis-DCE). The high
   dechlorination rates observed for PCE make anaerobic bioventing an
   attractive method that can potentially be integrated in an in-situ
   remediation process to treat contaminated soils in the unsaturated zone.

Abstract = {{The inactivation kinetics of two strains of bacterial aerobic spores
   were investigated in a batch reactor for two pH levels (6.3 and 8.2) and
   various ozone dosages (0.5-2.5 mg/l). The kinetics of ozone
   decomposition was found to satisfactorily fit a first-order decay model.
   The CT (concentration x contact time) values were calculated using the
   modified Hom equation with exponential disinfectant decay. Lower pH
   resulted in lower CT values. The environmental spores tested were not as
   resistant to ozone as the reference strain of B. subtilis. Comparison of
   CT values for aerobic spores with published data suggests that bacterial
   spores could be a surrogate for evaluating the stone inactivation of G.
   lamblia cysts and C. parvum (oo)cysts during drinking water
   disinfection. However, more information on the resistance of naturally
   occurring populations of bacterial spores would be needed before they
   are used as an indicator of ozone disinfection efficiency. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The presence of biodegradable organic matter (BOM) can affect drinking
   water quality. A variety of treatment processes can be used to control
   BOM during drinking water production. Studies of enhanced coagulation
   (coagulation optimized for removal of dissolved organic material as well
   as particles) showed that removal of DOC could be improved from the
   current average of 29\% (plant conditions termed baseline coagulation)
   to an average of 43\% for optimized coagulation at the 10 sites tested.
   Similarly, removal of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC)
   could be improved from the current baseline level of 30\% to 38\%
   through the application of optimized coagulation. At lower pH, ferric
   coagulants generally performed better for removal of organic carbon than
   did alum or polyaluminum chloride. In most of the cases, assimilable
   organic carbon (AOC) was not affected by coagulation, probably because
   the AOC fraction was composed of small molecular weight, non-humic
   compounds that are not amenable to coagulation. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nutrient budget models for lakes and reservoirs critically respond to
   the input pollutant loading, yet little consensus exists on how to
   estimate the load, particularly for the common but challenging case of
   sparse nutrient concentration measurements and abundant input flow data.
   A statistical load calculation using cluster (in this case, annual) mean
   concentration and stratified (monthly) flow was compared to estimates by
   sample mean and ratio estimator methods for phosphorus loading to
   Whitney Reservoir in North Central Texas. The results varied
   considerably for the various estimator methods during the six-year study
   period with the cluster and stratified mean approach estimating extreme
   high loading periods not captured by the other methods. The variable
   loading patterns were then tested in phosphorus budget model simulations
   for Whitney Reservoir that considered vertical stratification of the
   water column, water-sediment phosphorus interaction, and seasonal
   variations in water quality. For independently determined
   settling,interlayer dispersion, recycling rates, and sediment burial
   rates estimated for the respective loading calculation, the cluster and
   stratified mean loading pattern provided a batter statistical fit of
   phosphorus concentration measurements in the epilimnion than when ratio
   estimator load calculations were used. The two loading functions
   described hypolimnion concentration data equally well. The lesson of
   this exercise is that various methods of load estimation should be
   examined in order to develop as reliable a management model as possible
   when only a sparse data set is available for calibration. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Assimilable organic carbon (AOC) and biodegradable dissolved organic
   carbon (BDOC) were measured in Norwegian raw and drinking waters.
   Several of the water-works investigated produce a drinking water which
   is, or approximates to, biological stability according to the AOC
   analysis. The reduction of AOC by water treatment was shown to be a
   function of the raw water quality and the particular treatment process.
   Levels of AOC were generally low in Norwegian raw and drinking waters,
   and thus the situation appears promising with respect to controlling
   microbial aftergrowth during distribution. Coagulation-filtration
   (mainly direct filtration) trains and anionic exchange achieved
   significant reductions in AOC, whereas membrane filtration had little
   effect. Treatment plants using limited or no specific measures for
   removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and postchlorination,
   increased AOC levels. Disinfection with UV light may produce less AOC
   than chlorination. BDOC was effectively reduced by all water treatments.
   Membrane filtration performed at least as well as other treatments in
   removing BDOC. This suggests that bulk BDOC is typically of higher
   molecular weight than AOC. Correlations between AOC and BDOC in raw and
   drinking waters were not significant. This finding supports the
   contention that these parameters are independent measures of the labile
   organic fraction of natural waters. II seems likely that the AOC and
   BDOC analyses target different fractions of the biodegradable organic
   material (BOM). When AOC and BDOC were used to evaluate the
   effectiveness of treatment processes the results were more promising.
   Correlation factors showed that these parameters generally provided
   complementary information about the fate of BOM during water treatment.
   However, because BDOC decreased during water treatment at all but one
   plant, whereas AOC often increased, necessitates that the raw data and
   the correlation factors be presented together in studies of this nature.
   The addition of nutrient salts in the AOC assay usually gave moderate
   increases in the values obtained. Consequently, nutrients other than
   organic carbon may limit aftergrowth in Norwegian drinking water. Use of
   an alternative bioassay organism gave lower AOC values, thus confirming
   the suitability of the standard assay organism. (C) 2000 Elsevier

   in fortified 50-500 ml water samples. The best result was obtained with
   N,N-dimethyl-1,4-phenylendiammonium dichloride (N,N-DPDD). A water
   analysis method meeting the WHO drinking water guideline concentration
   value, 1 mu g/l of microcystin-LR, was developed employing N,N-DPDD. The
   method was tested by analyzing blind 38 authentic natural water samples,
   studied earlier by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and
   protein phosphatase inhibition assay (PP). In 31 samples the results of
   all three methods were consistent. Two apparently false positive results
   were obtained by TLC, and in two samples results were positive by ELISA
   and TLC but not PP. In one sample the result was positive by PP but not
   ELISA or TLC. Two samples were positive by ELISA and PP and not TLC, but
   a full 50 ml sample for TLC was not available in these cases, thus
   making the detection limit higher. Results suggest that the present TLC
   method is comparable with the ELISA and PP assays, and TLC can be used
   for cost-effective monitoring of water samples according to the WHO
   guidelines. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance and activity of gulls at sewage outfalls in South Wales
   and southern England was studied between 1972 and 1999. In winter, the
   black-headed gull was the most abundant species, followed by herring,
   common and lesser black-backed gulls. The abundance of black-headed
   gulls and herring gulls was significantly correlated with the volume of
   sewage discharged. Sewers supported only a small portion of the gull
   populations present in both areas, and a higher proportion of juvenile
   birds were present than at other feeding sites. Sewage comminution
   increased the numbers of black-headed gulls feeding, but infrequent
   intermittent discharge reduced them by over a half. Gulls selectively
   consumed waste foodstuffs from sewage and thus helped recycle some of
   its organic constituents. However, some individuals carried bacterial
   pathogens, and could thus have contaminated nearby bodies of freshwater,
   or grassland, by washing and roosting there. Full sewage treatment, as
   planned for most of the discharges in both study areas is likely to
   provide the most effective means of gull control. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We have generated microbial sensors for analyzing the presence of
   various metals or metalloids by recombinant DNA technology. The strains
   are based on strictly regulated promoters controlling the expression of
   the firefly luciferase gene in microbial cells. The regulator-reporter
   constructs are located in shuttle plasmids capable of replicating in
   gram-negative or -positive microbial organisms. The sensors developed
   are real-time indicators of metal responsive gene expression giving
   results in approximately 30 min, with optimal induction times ranging
   from 60 to 240 min. We describe here the performance of these metal
   sensing bacteria for the assessment of different water samples spiked
   with lead, arsenic, mercury or cadmium. We show that these bacteria are
   sensitive detectors of metal bioavailability, which is difficult or even
   impossible to measure by traditional analytical chemistry methods. All
   measurements were done using freeze-dried bacteria, which makes these
   sensors reagent-like and also easy to use in field conditions. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were conducted using pure cultures of Nocardia
   amarae and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus under aerobic and
   anaerobic/aerobic cyclic conditions to determine the control of Nocardia
   in mixed cultures by biological selection. The objective was to
   investigate the ability of anaerobic/aerobic sequencing conditions such
   as in enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) process to control
   Nocardia through competitive selection of Acinetobacter. Aerobic batch
   experiments showed that Nocardia due to its lower maximum specific
   growth rate (mu(max) = 2.3/d), and observed yield (Y-obs = 0.23 g VSS
   produced/g COD removed) than those of Acinetobacter (mu(max) = 6.2/d,
   and Y-obs = 0.35 g VSS produced/g COD removed) will not be able to
   compete in the dual culture utilizing the same carbon source. Under
   anaerobic/aerobic conditions in sequencing batch reactors (SBR),
   Nocardia was washed out in about 17 days, whereas, Acinetobacter grew
   successfully to a steady state concentration approximately equal to its
   initial concentration. When equal mass of Nocardia and Acinetobacter
   were grown as a dual culture in SBR, Nocardia concentration decreased
   from about 200 mg VSS/L to near detectable levels after 56 h under
   aerobic conditions and was completely washed out under alternating
   anaerobic/aerobic conditions in about 24 h. Acinetobacter grew
   successfully in the dual culture in both completely aerobic and
   alternating anaerobic/aerobic SBR to 125-140\% of the initial
   concentration. Polyphosphate accumulation was not seen either in single
   cultures or in dual cultures of Nocardia and Acinetobacter under
   anaerobic/aerobic cyclic conditions in a sequencing batch reactor. These
   results suggest that Nocardia cannot compete well with Acinetobacter
   under anaerobic/aerobic conditions such as in EBPR, and hence will be
   washed out of such systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study compares the biotic precipitation of iron in the sand filters
   of a new freshwater plant, Astrup, with the abiotic precipitation of
   iron in the sand Biters of a traditional freshwater plant. Forum, in the
   same area of Denmark. We have observed that a third freshwater plant,
   Grindsted, which was planned to precipitate iron in the traditional
   abiotic way is in fact precipitating iron biotically because of poor
   aeration and very low oxygen content of the raw water. The dominant
   iron-precipitating bacteria was Gallionella ferruginea in both Astrup
   and Grindsted. The morphology of the iron precipitates were investigated
   using light, X-ray, scanning electron and transmission electron
   microscopy. The physicochemical conditions governing precipitation and
   the precipitated iron sludge were also investigated. The biotically
   precipitated iron was shown to be oxidised and precipitated with a rate
   about 60 times faster than the traditional abiotic process in spite of
   the much poorer physicochemical conditions for the process. The faster
   kinetics indicate a catalytic activity due to the presence of
   exopolymers from Gallionella ferruginea. A model is proposed for the
   relationship between the differences in characteristics of the iron
   precipitate and the kinetics of the precipitation. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Biofilms in the drinking water distribution system can protect pathogens
   from disinfection and provide the inocula for periodic infestations.
   Assessing these biofilms can be difficult, as the plate counts of
   pelagic bacteria may bear little relationship to the biofilm load.
   Culturing the water at the outlet most often does not reflect the
   biofilm composition. Herein we show that analysis of polar lipid fatty
   acids recovered from biofilms on devices possessing a large surface area
   provides quantitative analysis of the Viable biomass, community
   composition, and nutritional status that is independent of the recovery
   and culturability. Analysis of the polar lipid fatty acids indicated the
   biofilm contained a stressed and predominantly Gram-negative bacterial
   community. The composition was not significantly different whether
   collected in the summer or winter. Oxirane (epoxide) fatty acids were
   detected in the polar lipids of the biofilm, indicating exposure to
   chlorine and loss of viability within the biofilm. Tests with
   monocultures of Escherichia coli and Sphingomonas paucimobilis exposed
   to chlorine resulted in oxirane fatty acid generation and rendered them
   nonculturable. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{When characterizing real waste waters and sludges, usually collective
   parameters like COD and TOC are used. Detailed protocols (USEPA, APHA,
   DIN) concerned with the analytical determination of these parameters
   exist. However. some difficulties may arise when interpreting the
   measured values. Waste waters may contain substances refractory to the
   COD determination, or high concentrations of easily oxidizable inorganic
   salts may be mistaken for organic matter.
   When treating waste waters and sludges using physical, chemical or
   biological processes, there may be unexpected phenomena apparently
   contributing to a reduction or even concentration of the dissolved
   substances: adsorption effects (on reactor walls, catalyst, biomass),
   stripping of volatile organics, sedimentation, complexation,
   precipitation, or evaporation of water. When monitoring only COD or TOC,
   one cannot conclude whether a change of these values is due to a
   chemical degradation process or to a purely physical elimination like
   stripping.
   In this paper the concept of the mean oxidation number of organic carbon
   (MOC) is presented. By combining TOC (or DOG) and COD measurements, one
   can obtain valuable additional information concerning the reaction
   development during waste water treatment processes. especially when
   oxidative transformations are involved. The applicability of the MOC
   concept is demonstrated using the wet oxidation of pyridine, stripping
   of toluene. decarboxylation of malonic acid, and wet oxidation of phenol
   as well as the wet oxidation of sewage sludge as an example of a real
   system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum sulfate (alum) is routinely added in many water treatment
   systems as a coagulant. Some amount of aluminum may persist in the
   filtered water designated for human consumption. However, there are no
   reliable data to predict the magnitude of residual concentrations that
   would reach consumers' taps. Studies in the United States, Canada,
   Europe, and Japan associated aluminum in tap water with various health
   problems, most notably, neuro-skeletal disorders and cognitive
   impairments. Whether or not aluminum in the drinking water is, indeed, a
   risk factor for these diseases has not been resolved conclusively.
   However, evidence has accumulated to suggest that it might be prudent to
   minimize residual aluminum in drinking water supplies. Harris County,
   Texas, by virtue of its multiple water supply sources and treatment
   methods, provides a unique opportunity to study spatial variations in
   concentrations of aluminum in the tap water within a defined geographic
   location. Statistical analysis of sampling results, coupled with GIS
   mapping, showed a range of variations, from none detected to as much as
   530 mu g/l of total aluminum in tap water. Peak concentrations were
   associated with source water treated with alum and were 2.5 times in
   excess of 200 mu g/l currently recommended for public drinking water
   supplies. Median concentrations in the alum-treated water were up to
   five times greater than in raw water, regardless of its origin (surface
   or ground), and greater than in the water treated with an alternative
   coagulant (ferric chloride). Our findings show that options exist to
   minimize residual aluminum and these options need to be explored. (C)

Abstract = {{A series of batch reactor studies were conducted to obtain kinetic data
   for optimizing phyto-treatment of water contaminated with
   trinitrotoluene (TNT). A plant screening study indicated that stonewort
   and parrotfeather were the most effective among the plants tested;
   parrotfeather being chosen for further testing because it is heartier
   and easier to cultivate than stonewort. Treatment was reproducible under
   similar conditions, and sequential formation and breakdown of
   aminodinitrotoluene (ADNT) and diaminonitrotoluene (DANT) were observed
   in the aqueous phase. TNT removal rates increased with increased plant
   density. and removal kinetics increased with increasing temperature up
   to 34 degrees C. Michaelis-Menton kinetics applied to the phyto-removal
   of TNT. At concentrations less than 5.5 mg/l TNT, a pseudo-first-order
   approximation of the Michealis-Menton equation was used with acceptable
   deviation. Prior exposure to TNT did not appear to have a significant
   effect on phyto-transformation rates, suggesting that the mechanisms for
   removal were not induced. Small concentrations of ADNT were found in the
   plant material, however, TNT was not detected. The results indicated
   that optimized reactors for the phyto-treatment of contaminated
   wastewater and groundwater are feasible, increasing degradation rates
   and decreasing reactor volumes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Multiple continuous-flow reactors were operated at 55 degrees C under
   potassium-limited conditions to investigate energy spilling metabolism
   during thermophilic aerobic biological wastewater treatment. Energy
   spilling metabolism has been previously shown to reduce the observed
   cell growth yield at short mean cell residence times, which could
   potentially be used to promote autothermal operation during the
   biological treatment of high-strength wastewater. Under the
   potassium-limited conditions imposed during these experiments, cell
   yields decreased at lower residence times. commensurate with the
   characteristic pattern of energy spilling conditions. The minimum growth
   yield measured was 0.19 mg TSS per mg COD removed, which was believed to
   be too high to promote autothermal reactor operation for thermophilic
   treatment. These results suggest that operation of conventional
   biological treatment processes under energy spilling conditions could be
   used to reduce the net production of residual biomass. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Laboratory scale experiments were performed in a non-continuous batch
   reactor system with 0.8-41.2 l domestic sewage exposed to constant light
   intensity, temperature and humidity. The treatment performance of
   duckweed (L. gibba)-covered sewage lagoons (DSL) was studied within a
   CODtotal range of 200-500 mg/l (113-294 mg CODfilt/l), in 10, 30, 70 and
   95 cm deep reactors, and liquid mixing intensity (power dissipation) of
   0, 0.3, 1.0, 2.3 and 34.1 W/m(3). The duration of each experiment was 20
   days with biomass harvesting every 5 days. COD removal at extreme depths
   and extreme mixing intensities was compared with that in covered control
   reactors without duckweed. Removal of CODfilt did not differ in
   duckweed-covered and control reactors. The role of duckweed cover was
   marginal in changing the redox potential or the DO. COD removal
   lambda(r) (kg CODfilt/ha 20 days) correlated strongly with initial
   surface load lambda(s) (kg CODfilt/ha). Concentration removal (as mg
   CODfilt/l) was also proportional to initial CODfilt concentration. For a
   given CODfilt mass input. increasing depth up to 1 m affected DSL
   performance only by increasing surface load, and not by hampering oxygen
   transfer. Mixing (up to 2.3 W/m(3)) raised CODfilt removal. Therefore,
   at depths beyond 70 cm, moderate mixing is recommended. The first-order
   kinetic removal rate coefficient for CODfilt was 0.04-0.06 d(-1). (C)

Abstract = {{Laboratory scale experiments were performed in a non-continuous batch
   reactor system with 0.8 to 41.2 l with domestic sewage exposed to
   constant light intensity, temperature and humidity. The contribution of
   duckweed (L. gibba) to N and P removal in duckweed-covered sewage
   lagoons (DSL) was studied at NH4+ concentration of 25-96 mg/l with 10,
   30, 70 and 95 cm deep reactors, and liquid mixing intensity of 0, 0.3,
   1.0, 2.3 and 31.1 W/m(3). Duration of each experiment was 20 d with
   biomass harvesting every 5 d. N and P removal at extreme depths and
   extreme mixing intensities was compared with that in covered control
   reactors without duckweed. For a given N input, depth as an independent
   variable would not affect overall N removal except through increase of
   surface lending, whereas mixing had a significant positive effect at
   high Kj-N concentration. TP removal was stronger correlated with depth
   than with surface loading lambda(P). At low nitrogen surface lending
   lambda(N) of 183 kg N/ha, TN removal could he completely attributed to
   duckweed uptake, whereas st high lambda(N) (>300 kg N/ha), which
   correlated with high NH4+ concentration, N uptake was inhibited to less
   than 50\% of total removal. TP removal increased from 8.25 kg P/ha 20 d
   at higher Kj-N concentration (102 mg N/l) to 18.66 kg P/ha 20 d at lower

Abstract = {{The remediation of streams adversely affected by acidic mine drainage
   often employs limestone as a neutralization agent. However, metal
   precipitation on the limestone surface can render it ineffective. This
   investigation reports preliminary field and laboratory results
   demonstrating that, in the presence of a mixture of limestone and
   sandstone. iron preferentially precipitates on the sandstone surface,
   and iron removal from aqueous solution is greater than with either of
   the materials alone. First, a river in Tennessee (USA) with preferential
   iron precipitation was characterized with respect to water quality and
   lithic surface morphology. Second, a field experiment where lithic
   samples were placed in an Ohio stream receiving coal mine drainage
   demonstrated that iron hydroxide preferentially coats quartz-rich
   lithologies. Finally, laboratory experiments confirmed enhanced iron
   removal in the presence of mixed lithic surfaces. Based on these
   results, the use of multiple lithic surfaces, particularly in-stream,

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate two-stage aerobic
   thermophilic and anaerobic mesophilic treatment of swine waste. The
   two-stage system included a 1-day sludge retention time (SRT) aerobic
   thermophilic reactor operating at 62 degrees C and with 1.0 mg dissolved
   oxygen/l, followed by a 5, 9, and 14-day SRT anaerobic mesophilic
   digester operating at 37 degrees C. A single stage anaerobic mesophilic
   digester operating at 6, 10, and 15-day SRT and 37 degrees C was used as
   the control. Feed swine waste slurry average composition included total
   solids (TS) = 4.3\%; volatile solids (VS) = 67\% of TS; supernatant
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) = 14,330 mg/l; fecal coliform density = 7.2
   x 10(8) MPN/g TS; pH = 7.1; and alkalinity = 2700 mg CaCO3/l. Two-stage
   system operating at 6, 10, and 15-day system SRT reduced VS by 46, 54,
   and 61\%, respectively, and was significantly better than the control at
   each SRT. Supernatant COD reduction by the two-stage system (56-67\%)
   was significantly better than that obtained in the control (44-60\%).
   Fecal coliform density was reduced to < 10(3) MPN/g TS at all SRT by the
   two-stage system, whereas, the control did not reduce the fecal coliform
   density below 10(5) MPN/g TS at all SRT. The two-stage system anaerobic
   digester produced 0.56-0.64 m(3) CH4/kg VS destroyed compared to lower
   levels of 0.47-0.51 m(3) CH4/kg VS destroyed by the control, both
   operating at 6, 10, and 15-day system SRT. The methane gas production by
   the two-stage system of 0.26, 0.32, and 0.39 m(3)/kg VS fed at 6, 10,
   and IS-day system SRT, respectively, was significantly higher than that
   by the control system (0.17, 0.22, and 0.25 m(3)/kg VS fed at 6, 10, and
   15-day SRT, respectively). The biogas produced by the two-stage system
   anaerobic digester contained 353-387 ppm (v/v) H2S content compared to
   569-609 ppm (v/v) H2S content in the biogas from the control anaerobic
   digester. The time-to-filter values of the product sludge from the
   two-stage system (245, 197, and 158 s at 6, 10, and 15-day system SRT,
   respectively) were about 50\% lower than those of the product sludge
   from the control (355, 295, and 250 s at 6, 10, and 15-day system SRT,
   respectively), indicating better dewaterability of the two-stage system
   product sludge. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A complete nitrogen mass balance for all wastewater generated in the
   Central Arizona-Phoenix ecosystem was developed using data from the 18
   largest wastewater treatment plants (99\% of flow). Components included
   total N in raw wastewater, denitrification in wastewater treatment
   plants, biosolids production, and effluent (reuse, recharge, and
   discharge). Denitrification and biosolids production remove 81\% of
   wastewater N. Nearly all biosolids are recycled to cotton fields within
   the ecosystem. Most effluent is recycled within the ecosystem. As the
   result of wastewater management practices developed to reuse wastewater,
   wastewater N is either deliberately volatilized or accumulates within
   the system: only 4\% of the original wastewater N is exported via the
   Gila River. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel conjugation method was developed by linking the hapten, the
   cyanobacterial hepatotoxin microcystin-LR, via 2-mercaptoethylamine to
   keyhole limpet haemocyanin. Polyclonal antisera were raised against this
   conjugate and an indirect competitive immunoassay (ELISA) developed
   which can detect purified microcystin-LR and the toxin in extracts of
   cyanobacteria From fresh-, brackish and marine waters. The
   cross-reactivity of the microcystin-LR antibodies was investigated with
   a range of purified microcystin variants (-LR, -LA, -LY, -LW, -LF,
   -D-Asp(3)-RR, and -Asp(3)(Z)-Dhb(7)-HtyR) and nodularin. The antibodies
   cross-reacted well with all microcystin and nodularin variants. The
   microcystin-LA was the most readily detectable, followed by
   microcystins-LR, -LF, -LW, -D-Asp(3)-RR, -LY, nodularin and
   microcystin-Asp(3)(Z)-Dhb(7)-HtyR. Extracts from several genera of
   cyanobacteria were investigated by the ELISA and the results compared to
   high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection
   (HPLC-DAD). By the ELISA procedure, 60\% were positive, compared to
   detection of microcystins in 45\% of the samples by HPLC-DAD. Analysis
   of microcystin-LR equivalents by ELISA and HPLC-DAD showed good
   correlation (R = 0.96, p < 1 x 10(-10)). The application of the
   anti-microcystin-LR antibodies for the detection and quantification of
   microcystins and nodularin in environmental water samples is discussed.

Abstract = {{Seventy water samples were collected from three Lake Erie beaches to
   compare recoveries of Escherichia coli (E. coli) using the
   USEPA-recommended method for recreational waters (mTEC) to recoveries
   using three alternative methods (MI, modified mTEC, and Colilert).
   Statistical tests showed no differences in recoveries of E. coli between
   hi I and mTEC: however, statistically-significant differences were found
   between modified mTEC or Colilert and mTEC. The MI agar method provided
   the most similar assessment of recreational water quality to mTEC among
   the three alternative methods tested. The range of differences between
   Colilert and mTEC was widest among the three alternative methods. In a
   sample group with a range of values near the single-sample bathing-water
   standard, recoveries of E. coli were statistically lower using modified
   mTEC than mTEC; however, MI and Colilert compared well to mTEC in this
   range. Because samples were collected in a small geographic area, more
   work is necessary to test within-method variability of the modified
   mTEC, MI and Colilert methods and to evaluate these methods as
   substitutes for the mTEC method in a variety of recreational waters.

Abstract = {{The solubilities of the eight most common resin acids have been measured
   using a solid phase extraction and gas chromatography determination.
   Their acute toxicity has also been determined by a bioassay procedure
   using Daphnia magna as LC50 values following different periods of
   exposure and the toxicity has been shown to correlate well with fish
   toxicity measurements using rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri). The
   solubility and toxicity of individual resin acids have been shown to be
   structure dependent. Dehydroabietic acid is the most soluble, and the
   pimaric type resin acids are the least soluble. Toxicity has also been
   found to correlate inversely with solubility. Isopimaric acid is the
   most toxic and least soluble acid, whilst dehydroabietic acid is the
   least toxic and most soluble. Pimaric type resin acids are more toxic
   and less soluble than the abietic type. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to efficiently operate Fenton's oxidation
   process with quantitative analysis of the amount of the organic
   substances removed by oxidation and coagulation in treatment of the
   non-biodegradable landfill leachate by Fenton's reagents. The sample
   used was the biologically treated leachate in the Kimpo metropolitan
   landfill site in Korea and its GOD, BOD5, NH3-N and Cl- concentrations
   were about 1500, 30, 1300 and 1500 mg/l, respectively. The COD removal
   by oxidation of the organic substances with hydrogen peroxide was most
   efficient in the pH range of 2.5-4. However, it drastically decreased
   according to the pH value above 5. The COD removal efficiency by
   coagulation increased with the increase of the ferrous sulfate dosage,
   but the overall efficiency over a minimum dosage of 500 mg/l was
   scarcely changed. The efficiency of hydrogen peroxide actually used in
   the oxidation of the organic substances was only about 45\%. The optimum
   range of the coagulation pH to maximize the COD removal efficiency by
   coagulation was 3-6, but that was slightly lower than the pH range of
   6-9 generally known in the literature. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Photocatalytic mineralization of 2-chlorobiphenyl (2-CB) in aqueous
   TiO(2) suspensions was conducted under four different oxygen partial
   pressures (Po(2)) in closed reactors. The observed O(2) adsorption
   equilibrium constant in TiO(2) aqueous suspension was 0.88 (kPa)(-1)
   based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate function. Apart from the
   conventional electron-scavenging function, the dissolved oxygen was
   critical for the degradation of the hydroxyl intermediates, i.e.,
   2-chlorobiphenyl-ols and biphenyl-2-ol, which are potentially toxic.
   Degradation of 2-CB in the irradiated H(2)O(2) aqueous solutions under
   two different Pot was also studied for comparison. For UV/H(2)O(2), For
   does-not affect the removal of 2-CB, while reducing the Pot from 21 to 2
   kPa resulted in 35\% less CO(2) formation after 5 h irradiation. The
   similar O(2)-dependent destruction of the hydroxyl intermediates was
   also observed in the UV/H(2)O(2) system. We propose that molecular O(2)
   acts as a key reactant following the attack of a second OH radical
   during the ring opening in the degradation of the hydroxyl byproducts.

Abstract = {{The presence of soluble sulfides in a low alkalinity simulated drinking
   water increased copper pipe corrosion rates by more than one order of

   Sulfides caused formation of a thick, black porous scale layer on pipes
   that did not significantly reduce pipe corrosion rates even after 9
   months of exposure. In fact, both the anodic and cathodic reactions were
   catalyzed when sulfide containing scale was smeared onto a new copper
   pipe surface. Sulfide scales have a unique ability to accelerate copper
   corrosion even at pH > 9.0, with potentially devastating consequences
   for copper tube performance in potable water applications. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The nitrification step of a biological nitrogen removal process
   conducted in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was studied. The process
   is time oriented and history-dependent: changes in the length of fill
   and react phases alter process productivity. Due to process complexity,
   heuristic optimization is rarely efficient, and a model-based approach
   is often necessary. In the present work, IAWQ No. 1 Model (Henze, M.,
   Grady, C. P. L, Gujer, W., Marais, G. V. R. and Matsuo T. (1987). A
   general model for single-sludge wastewater treatment systems. Water
   Research, 21(5), 505-515), originally developed for activated sludge
   processes, was adapted to SBR, and batch scheduling and filling strategy
   was sought with a constrained successive quadratic programming (SQP)
   algorithm. Productivity results favored a discrete fill strategy,
   consisting of symmetric pulses for wastewater and oxygen supply to the
   system. Optimal conditions were imposed on an instrumented bench scale
   SBR and a significant reduction in batch time was achieved, using a
   symmetric pulse strategy for wastewater and oxygen addition. (C) 2000

Title = {{Quantitative analysis of trace levels of geosmin and MIB in source and

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Two volatile organic compounds (VOCs) responsible for the majority of
   taste and odour events in drinking water are geosmin
   (trans-1,10-dimethyl-trans-9-decalol) and MIB (2-methylisoborneol).
   These VOCs have odour threshold concentrations at ng l(-1) levels.
   Quantitative analysis of such trace concentration levels has required
   the use of technically complex and time-consuming analytical methods. In
   this study, a simple headspace solid phase microextraction procedure
   (HSPME) was developed and applied successfully to the qualitative and
   quantitative analysis of source water and drinking water samples.
   Concentrations of geosmin and MIB measured in these samples ranged from
   1 to 1000 ng l(-1). The HSPME method achieved typical precision of
   5-12\% in a wide variety of sample matrices. Materials required were low
   cost and the protocol allowed sample turnover of 60-75 min per sample.
   HSPME proved to be a very practical technology for the analysis of
   geosmin, MIB and other potent volatile compounds in surface waters. (C)

Abstract = {{The sorption of tributyltin (TBT) chloride from aqueous solution to
   sediment and partitioning between overlying water and pore water were
   investigated in both batch sorption experiments and laboratory simulated
   estuarine microcosms using the natural sediment collected from Tianjin
   Harbor. Sorption coefficients of 8862 l/kg at 25 degrees C and 7511 l/kg
   at 35 degrees C were respectively obtained from batch adsorption
   isotherms. Rates of adsorption and desorption in the sediment were fast
   with 98\% of the maximum sorbed amount by the sediment and 80\% of the
   equilibrium aqueous TBT concentration desorbed from the sediment
   achieved within 30 min. The sorption of TBT on the sediment was a
   reversible process. The rate of TBT partitioning into pore water was
   more rapid than the sorption process and the apparently fast rate of the
   sorption in the upper sediment was due to mixing between pore water and
   overlying water. Salinity had little effect on the sorption of TBT on
   the sediment while the partitioning coefficient between pore water and
   surface water decreased with increasing salinity. The pH had significant
   effects on both sorption on the sediment and partition into the pore
   water. A study in simulated estuarine microcosms indicated that TBT
   sorption on the sediment followed the process of TBT partitioning into
   the pore water after TBT rapidly disappeared from the overlying water.
   Microbial activity promoted the distribution of TBT in the pore water
   and sediment. Biodegradation of TBT to DBT, MBT and even inorganic tin
   occurred in the lower layers of sediment samples. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Spatial variations of oxygen concentration were measured instantaneously
   in water body using the fluorescence intensity image technology, The
   movement of a fluorescent solution was visualized according to the
   oxygen concentration difference. Pyrenebutyric acid (PBA) was used as a
   fluorescence and a charge couple-device (CCD) camera as an image
   detector. The calibration of fluorescence intensity as a function of
   oxygen concentration and temperature was utilized for a direct
   measurement of oxygen concentration at every pixel in an image of light
   intensity. Light intensity decreased about 40\% while the amount of
   oxygen in water increased from zero to the air-saturated concentration
   (8.5 mg/l at 21 degrees C), suggesting that the technique is
   sufficiently sensitive to determine the variation of oxygen
   concentration. Consecutive images of the oxygen content of a submerged
   jet solution were provided to quantify the spatial variation of oxygen
   in a water body. Analysis of these images also described the movement of
   solution, suggesting that the visualization technique could be applied
   more widely for research in experimental fluid flow and chemical
   transport in water bodies. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Three simple extraction methods were evaluated for the measurement of
   atrazine in the tissues of two species of freshwater snail. One-way
   analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the highest significant
   concentrations were measured following extraction by manual trituration
   and sonication. with methanol as solvent. Accumulation of atrazine was
   measured for 20 days of toxicant exposure. Physa acuta had 11.74 +/-
   0.12 mg kg(-1) FW and Ancylus fluviatilis had 8.46 +/- 0.5 mg kg(-1)
   This protocol allowed efficient atrazine extraction from small samples
   of animal tissue. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the performance of maerl (calcified seaweed);Is a
   substrate for artificial wetland waste treatment systems. Pilot scale
   artificial wetlands were set up in the laboratory; three planted with
   Phragmites australis and three unplanted, and fed with a synthetic
   sewage solution. The effluent from the tanks was monitored over a period
   of 9 weeks for chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen. total phosphorus,
   ammonium-N, total oxidised nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus,
   dissolved oxygen, pH and temperature. The data were analysed using
   repeated measures ANOVA to look for significant differences between
   treatments, and within treatments, over time. A batch incubation
   experiment was also carried out to ascertain the maximum adsorption
   capacity of maerl for phosphorus. Results obtained were compared with
   those in the literature for other substrates. Variability within and
   between treatments was high, but it was found that maerl effectively
   removed total phosphorus (98\%). Nitrogen removal was less effective,
   with the tanks producing ammonium-N. The low nitrogen removal shown in
   the tanks was a factor of the short duration of the experiment; but
   ammonification did decrease in the planted tanks over time. Performance
   at removing nitrogen was normal when compared with figures in the
   literature, but phosphorus removal by maerl was considerably higher than
   gravel bed wetlands, and comparable with the very best figures given for
   artificial wetlands based on novel substrates such as shales and slags.
   This trial showed that maerl has great potential as a constructed
   wetland substrate, due to its high phosphorus-adsorbing capacity. (C)

Abstract = {{A simple technique using a low flow gas meter is described for the
   off-line and on-line measurement of hydrogen peroxide. The volume of
   oxygen produced from the reaction of the enzyme catalase with hydrogen

   on-line assays and 25-500 mg/l and 0.38-3\% for the off-line method. A
   response time of 17 min was obtained for the off-line for hydrogen
   peroxide concentrations of 25-500 mg/l. The response time of an on-line
   version of the method was approximately 5 min for hydrogen peroxide
   concentrations of 0.25-1.5\%. The technique was not significantly
   temperature sensitive in the range 25-45 degrees C. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A method for quantifying carbonate precipitated on granular activated
   carbon is described. Acidification of the sample causes carbon dioxide
   to evolve which is absorbed by sodium hydroxide and subsequently
   acidified and measured using a CO2 analyser. The method is applied to
   granular activated carbon, used in potable water treatment, to determine
   the extent of scaling caused by the precipitation of carbonate. The
   method was found in our laboratories to be highly consistent and
   reliable. Details of the method testing are included. The results of a
   15 month field study conducted at a surface water treatment works in a
   hard water area are presented and discussed. The data show that
   carbonate had accumulated on the granular activated carbon, however,
   alter a number of years in operation, loss processes were also evident.
   A significant difference (P < 0.01) in the amount of carbonate was
   recorded between the upflow and downflow cells of th: biflow adsorber.
   Large calcareous deposits over the surface of carbon particles were
   revealed by scanning electron microscopy. As a consequence of extended
   service-life of granular activated carbon, the use of acid washing to
   remove accumulated carbonate and improve the effectiveness of subsequent
   regeneration is discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the United States, shellfish growing areas are classified, in part,
   using standards based on the densities of either the total or fecal
   coliform groups in surface waters. However, the standards currently
   employed may not reliably index the presence of certain enteric
   pathogens, particularly enteric viruses responsible for human illnesses,
   even though both the pathogens and indicators derive from the same fecal
   contamination. To some extent, this may be due to differences in the
   survival of these pathogens in the environment relative to that of the
   bacterial indicators. This investigation was conducted to assess the
   effects of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, geographic location,
   season, and solar radiation on the survival of selected indicator
   microorganisms in estuarine waters. The indicators examined included
   fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli. Clostridium perfringens, and
   male-specific bacteriophage (MSB), a potential indicator of enteric
   viruses. In situ experiments were performed in estuarine waters of
   Alabama and Rhode Island.
   Among the parameters examined, sunlight and/or temperature most
   significantly affected indicator decay rates. In general. the effects
   from exposure to sunlight accounted for up to 83, 84, and 99\% of the
   density reductions of MSB, C, perfringens and fecal coliforms,
   respectively. Thus, the effects from sunlight were greatest on fecal
   coliforms and much less pronounced on MSB and C. perfringens. For fecal
   coliforms. the effect of sunlight was more pronounced during the winter
   than the summer. In the absence of sunlight, the rate of MSB decline was
   strongly negatively correlated with estuarine water temperatures and
   dissolved oxygen. Overall. fecal coliform decay rates were dissimilar to
   those found for MSB. From this. it would appear that fecal coliforms may
   not be reliable indicators of viruses in estuarine waters. Published by

Abstract = {{The rate constants of ozone with four groups of pesticides (4 phenolic-,
   8 organonitrogen-, 8 phenoxyalkylacitic-, and 4 heterocyclic
   N-pesticides) were determined under controlled conditions at a pH of
   7.5, ionic strength of ca 10(-3) M, and 100 mu M NaHCO3. The rate
   constant for BPMC was first determined from a pseudo-first order
   reaction model. the rate constants for the other pesticides were then
   obtained by a competition kinetic method using BPMC as the first
   reference compound. The rate constants were found to vary widely
   according to the pesticides. The highest rate constant was 27,600 M-1
   s(-1) for PCP and the lowest was 61.8 M-1 s(-1) for cyanazine. In order
   to quantify the effects of structure on the reactivity of pesticide with
   ozone, for each group of pesticides the rate constants were correlated
   with the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital
   (epsilon(HOMO)) The logarithm of the rate constants was found to
   linearly increase with the increase of the epsilon(HOMO) values except
   for the phenoxyalkylacitic group. When all examined pesticides were
   included in the correlation analysis. the rate constants gave a
   statistically unsatisfactory correlation with a coefficient of 0.92, but
   showed a similar trend of increasing reactivity with increasing
   epsilon(HOMO) values of pesticides. The results of the correlation
   analysis suggested that the reactivity of pesticides with ozone follows
   the frontier orbital theory and can be estimated by epsilon(HOMO) The
   rate constants for the phenoxyalkylacitic group could be estimated
   accurately by a two-parameter QSAR model based on absolute
   electronegativity and epsilon(HOMO) (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail

Abstract = {{This study investigates the anaerobic treatability of the reactive
   dyebath effluents in three different colors, namely, black, red and
   blue. by using a pilot scale two-phase UASB system which consisted of an
   acidification tank and a UASB reactor with a hydraulic retention time of
   about 12 h for each phase. In the first three experiments, the feed
   wastewater was prepared from real wastewaters to have a constant
   coloration of approximately 150 SU (space units) with three different
   concentrations of tapioca starch as a supplemental carbon source or a
   co-substrate. The fourth was an experiment on synthetic blue wastewater
   and the fifth was to study the effect of an initial coloration of 0, 50
   or 100 SU with a constant tapioca concentration of 500 mg/l. In the
   black-dye experiment, using the tapioca concentrations of 500, 1000 and
   1500 mg/l, the decolorization efficiencies were not much different,
   i.e., 67, 71 and 69\%, respectively. Subsequently, concentrations of 0,
   200 and 500 mg/l tapioca were used for the rid-dye and the blue-dye
   experiments. The decolorization efficiencies of the red-dye experiment
   were 36, 57 and 56\% and those of the blue-dye experiment were 48, 52
   and 56\%, respectively. In the synthetic wastewater, the decolorization
   efficiencies were 36, 54 and 57\% for 0, 200 and 500 mg/l tapioca,
   respectively, and in the last experiment, also with the synthetic
   wastewater, the efficiencies of decolorization of 63\% and 56\% were
   found for the initial colorations of 50 and 100 SU. respectively. The
   supplement of tapioca starch as a co-substrate apparently gave a better
   color removal performance but the excessively high concentration of
   tapioca did nor enhance the process capability in terms of color removal
   efficiency. Moreover, experimental results disclosed that sulfate
   reducing bacteria could increase the organic carbon comsumption of the
   system but they did not I,lay an important role in color reduction. The
   acid forming bacteria could have some role in the decolorization
   process, and the strictly anaerobic methane producing bacteria were not
   the main and only microorganisms responsible for the color reduction.

Abstract = {{Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) was removed from aqueous solution by
   exposure to a low-pressure mercury lamp in the presence of hydrogen
   peroxide in a recirculating batch reactor. Dark and UV-only tests were
   conducted to separate the effects of MTBE loss to system components and
   photolytic processes. Experiments were conducted at initial
   peroxide:MTBE molar ratios of 4:1, 7:1 and 15:1. Benzene was added in
   some experiments to estimate the hydroxyl radical concentration. The
   concentrations of MTBE, benzene and by-products were measured over a
   120-min period using a purge-and-trap CC-MS method. UV/H2O2 treatment
   resulted in > 99.9\% removal of MTBE with the major purgable by-product
   identified as tert-butyl formate (TBF). The second order rate constant
   for the degradation of MTBE from the hydroxyl radical was estimated to
   be 3.9 (+/-0.73) x 10(9) M(-1)s(-1) The second order rate constant for
   the reaction of TBF with the hydroxyl radical was estimated to be 1.2
   (+/-0.40) x 10(9) M(-1)s(-1). The yield for the formation of TBF from
   the reaction of MTBE and the hydroxyl radical was 0.28 +/- 0.032. After
   1 h of treatment the TBF remaining exceeded the remaining MTBE by as
   much as a factor of 35; this finding is important given the unknown
   human health impacts of TBF. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Lead in drinking water principally arises from contact between
   municipally supplied water and lead service pipes. Compliance sampling
   which is used to assess lead levels on a routine basis usually incurs a
   wide variability. This is due to the large number of random Factors
   which effect ii. A simulation programme has been written to mimic the
   sampling process, the variability in water quality, differences in the
   housing stock, and customer characteristics. Comparison is made in one
   case between the predicted and observed distribution of lead levels and
   found to be in good agreement. The analysis shows that for water with
   low alkalinity, fluctuations in water quality are a significant
   contributor to variability. The simulation programme is used to assess
   the significance of different performance measures, the impact of
   different measurement methods, and different lead strategies on lead
   exposure. The impact of sample size and the number of leaded properties
   in a compliance zone is analysed and discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The mineralization process for 2,4-dichiorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) at
   pH ca. 3 has been studied by advanced electrochemical oxidation
   processes (AEOPs), such as electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton
   processes, in which a Pt anode and a carbon-polytetrafluoroethylene
   O-2-fed cathode, for in situ production of H2O2 are used. A solution of
   230 ppm 2,4-D with a low salt content can be completely mineralized by
   the photoelectro-Fenton process at low current, whereas the
   electro-Fenton process leads to ca. 90\% of mineralization. In both
   methods. 2,4-D is quickly destroyed at the same rate. The high
   degradation power of these AEOPs is due to the large production of
   oxidizing hydroxyl radicals by reaction between electrogenerated H2O2
   and Fe2+ added to the solution. The higher mineralization rate found for
   photoelectro-Fenton is accounted for by the fast photolytic
   decomposition of some intermediates by UV light. Classical anodic
   oxidation with a graphite cathode and anodic oxidation in the presence
   of electrogenerated H2O2 are much less efficient methods to degrade
   2,4-D and its oxidation products. 2,4-Dichlorophenol.
   4,6-dichlororesorcinol, chlorohydroquinone and chlorobenzoquinone have
   been identified as intermediates by GC-MS and their evolution for each
   process has been followed by reverse-phase chromatography. Chloride ion
   is released from these chloroderivatives and accumulates in the medium.
   Short-chain acids, as glycolic, glyoxylic, maleic, fumaric and oxalic,
   have been detected by ion-exclusion chromatography. A general reaction
   pathway involving all these intermediates is proposed. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Current evaluations find savings in operating costs of greater than 25\%
   when denitrification is added to a system already achieving
   nitrification. The economic evaluations performed were based on a sludge
   reduction of 25\% under anoxic conditions compared to aerobic
   conditions. Conflicting reports of biosolids production for reactors
   operating under aerobic, anoxic and alternating aerobic conditions
   exist, This study quantifies and compares biosolids production rates for
   SBRs achieving carbon removal under aerobic or anoxic conditions as a
   function of temperature (14 degrees C and 20 degrees C). Proteins were
   chosen as model substrates because they are a major contributor to the
   total COD of raw sewage and by virtue of their high molecular weight,
   require hydrolysis. This study is unique in that the bacterial
   population was also enumerated using acridine orange direct counts
   (AODC). Observed yields were 35-52\% higher for the anoxic reactors than
   they were for the aerobic reactors. The observed yield for the aerobic
   reactor decreased by 4\% at a lower temperature whereas the anoxic yield
   increased by 8\%. Further analysis discounted that differences in
   observed yield were caused by an accumulation of influent proteins, A
   factorial analysis revealed that the anoxic reactor contained more
   bacteria than its aerobic counterpart. Microscopic examination of the
   mixed liquor showed th: presence of protozoa in the aerobic reactor
   while none were noted in the anoxic reactor. Predation is thought to be
   responsible for differences in the observed sludge production between
   anoxic and aerobic conditions, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, the biomass fractions of heterotrophs (X-H) and
   phosphate-accumulating organisms (X-PAO) were estimated through
   experimental results and theoretic:al calculation on the mass balance of
   organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus in a pilot scale biological
   nutrient removal process. The process, comprised of conventional
   anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic activated sludge and a rotating biological
   contactor in the aerobic stage, was controlled under steady state under
   conditions of a solid retention time of 10 days and a dissolved oxygen
   concentration of 2.0 mg/l in the aerobic stage. For long term operation,
   the process exhibited high performance in organic matter, nitrogen and
   phosphorus removal. The removal efficiency was 96.5, 70 and 100\% of
   organic matter, total nitrogen and total phosphorus, respectively.
   According to the mass balance calculation, approximately 62.0\% of
   organic matter, 48.0\% of nitrogen and 37.2\% of phosphorus of influent
   were removed in the form of carbon dioxide, nitrogen gas and
   polyphosphate, respectively. Regarding X-H and X-PAO as the major
   organisms responsible for biomass production, the yield fractions of X-H
   growth in anoxic and aerobic conditions were 48.4 and 39.4\%,
   respectively. Moreover, the yield fraction of X-PAO growth in aerobic
   conditions was 12.2\%. These results showed that X-H was the major
   community: moreover, only a minute amount of X-PAO was present in this
   nitrogen and phosphorus removal system for municipal wastewater
   treatment, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of natural organic matter (NOM) on the adsorption of the
   taste and odor causing compounds 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) and geosmin by
   powdered activated carbon was investigated. Equilibrium experiments
   showed that adsorption of MIB and geosmin in natural waters was an order
   of magnitude lower than single-solute adsorption. It was found that when
   the equilibrium concentration was expressed as a percentage of the
   initial concentration, the removal of MIB and geosmin in natural waters
   was independent of initial concentration. This relationship was also
   mathematically derived from the ideal adsorbed solution theorem when the
   concentration of the target compound was assumed to be much lower than
   the concentration of the competing NOM. A single equivalent background
   compound (EBC) was used to simulate the competitive effects of the
   background NOM and describe the adsorption of MIB and geosmin. The same
   EBC was found to be applicable to both MIB and geosmin and, at different
   initial concentrations, for all four waters. Three of the waters had
   similar ratios of EBC initial concentration to total organic carbon
   concentration. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A three year study on Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in
   sewage was conducted with emphasis upon: (1) development and assessment
   of techniques for sampling and processing sewage for these parasites:
   (2) a field study in which six sewage treatment works (STW) were
   assessed for removal of these parasites from the liquid phase; and (3)
   assessment of effect of sewage treatment an survival/destruction of
   Cryptosporidium oocysts.
   In sampling. grab samples were superior to filtered samples. In
   concentration and clarification of samples. the most efficient technique
   was that in which sample manipulation was minimised.
   Although calculated parasite removal efficiency varied for both
   parasites and between and within STW, some consistent patter ns were
   observed. First, Giardia cyst removal was significantly greater than
   Cryptosporidium oocyst removal. Second, most parasite removal occurred
   during secondary treatments, rather than during primary settlement.
   Third, no significant difference between efficacy of activated sludge
   treatment and trickling filters at parasite removal was detected. Also.
   in one STW which utilised tertiary sewage treatment, most removal from
   the liquid phase occurred during preceding treatment stages. Finally,
   one STW had significantly higher removal efficiencies of both parasites
   than the other live STW investigated.
   Low numbers of viable oocysts were detected at both influent and
   effluent. Survival was monitored by introducing oocysts, in containers
   bounded by semi-permeable membranes, into various environments within
   one STW. The results demonstrated that, over one week, none of the
   environments tested had a deleterious effect on oocyst viability, with
   the exception of the sludge holding tank.
   Results are discussed in relation to other published work on
   Cryptosporidium and Giardia in sewage and recommendations for further
   areas of research on this subject are made, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The number and variety of Freshwater species and bioassay procedures
   currently recommended in European Directives for assessing the risk
   posed by pollutants to freshwater ecosystems is rather limited. The aim
   of the three consecutive European Commission-sponsored programmes
   described here was to modify or develop new laboratory methods that
   could be used for evaluating toxicity to freshwater species and which
   would be suitable for incorporation into the current ``notification
   scheme{''} for new substances. An essential phase of each project was a
   validation process in which results of laboratory tests were compared
   with values obtained in the field using structural and functional
   responses of communities. The laboratory tests were developed by
   Fraunhofer-Institut fur Umweltchemie und Okotoxikologie (FhG)
   Potsdam-Rehbrucke with algae, protozoa and a variety of in vitro
   cellular/subcellular preparations; by the Stare University of Ghent with
   water column invertebrates, and by Cardiff University with benthic
   invertebrates. The laboratory tests included in vitro procedures,
   conventional whole organism single species tests, simple multi-species
   systems and microcosms. The field validation was carried out by Shell
   Research Sittingbourne employing artificial streams and by FhG
   Schmallenberg and GSF-Forschungszentrum fur Umwelt und Gesundheit,
   Munich with artificial ponds and included single species responses but
   also structural and functional community responses. The same reference
   chemicals: lindane, copper, 3,4-dichloroaniline and atrazine were used
   by all laboratories. A comparison of the most sensitive toxicity
   response determined for each reference chemical using the laboratory
   toxicity tests, with that determined by the field simulation procedures
   revealed that for the reference chemicals lindane, copper and atrazine,
   adverse effects were not detected either for single organisms or for
   structural and functional characteristics of the community or ecosystem,
   at concentrations below those identified in the laboratory toxicity
   tests. In the case of dichloroaniline, however, effects on the
   population dynamics of one species in the pond mesocosm were recorded at
   a concentration x16 below that reported in the laboratory. We conclude
   that appropriately designed, relatively simple and inexpensive
   laboratory toxicity tests with a selection of test species are generally
   adequate, with small application factors, for predicting the
   environmental risk of polluting chemicals to freshwater ecosystems. (C)

Abstract = {{The effect of an oxidative pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion of
   sewage sludge was investigated. Sewage sludge from a domestic wastewater
   treatment plant was partially oxidized by ozone. The pretreatment could
   alter up to 67\% of the organic matter: 29 +/- 3\% was solubilized, 38
   +/- 9\% was removed. Anaerobic degradability tests indicated that the
   pretreatment step enhanced the subsequent anaerobic sludge digestion.
   The methane production was increased by a factor of 1.8 after an ozone
   treatment at a dose of 0.1 g O-3/g chemical oxygen demand (COD), while
   the methane production rate was 2.2 times higher compared to the
   untreated sludge. Higher ozone doses, although still positive, were
   found to have a less pronounced effect. Limited ozone treatment appears
   compatible with subsequent digestion of biosolids and economically
   feasible. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling trickling filter performance requires knowledge of the
   distribution of flow velocities within the packed column. A probability
   density function (PDF) is developed for the likelihood of finding a
   given Row (Reynolds number) over a point on the packing material
   surface.
   The model predicts an exponential relationship between the Reynolds
   number and the probability of finding that flow rate. Wetted area,
   minimum flow rate to wet the packing material, and maximum flow rate
   before flooding of the packing material are calculated by methods
   presented by other authors. The PDF is subject to the constraints that
   the sum of probabilities for all non-zero flow rates must equal the
   wetted fraction, the sum of all local flows must equal the total flow
   applied to the filter, and only Reynolds numbers between the minimum and
   maximum are possible.
   Miniature trickling filters (25.4 mm in diameter, with 6.4 mm spherical
   polystyrene packing) are used to verify the filter flow models. Six
   nitrifying biofilm-coated filters and eleven new (no biofilm) filters
   are imaged using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to characterize the
   flow through the filter. NMR images are taken while a nutrient medium
   trickles over the columns at superficial flow rates of 75, 150, and 300
   m/d. Addition of a bi-polar velocity-encoding gradient in the NMR
   sequence allows water velocity measurement.
   The occurrence of Reynolds numbers calculated from the images agreed
   with the model predictions within 1.4\% for low Re (<30) and within
   0.3\% for the higher Reynolds numbers (>30). (C) 2000 Published by

Abstract = {{Ethylene glycol loss rate constants of 1.0 +/- 0.40 h(-1) were achieved
   in photo Fenton systems containing concentrations of 1000 mg/l ethylene

   system which may be due to the formation of ferric oxalate complexes.
   The system was inhibited by elevated concentrations of sulfate and a
   phosphate buffer solution. The optimal pH was 3.0, with significant
   decreases in the degradation rates below 2.8 and above 3.2. increased
   TOC loss was noted in similar UV/H2O2 systems indicating a potential for

Abstract = {{Combined anaerobic-aerobic treatment was used to treat a simulated
   textile industry wastewater (overall HRT 1.8 days). The azo dye (PROCION
   Red H-E7B) and starch concentrations were varied in a series of 1-week
   experiments to determine the effect of starch:dye ratio on GOD, BOD and
   colour removal. The treatment efficiency of the system at 1.9 g 1(-1)
   starch and 0.15 g 1(-1) dye remained constant over 130 days despite
   seven intervening 1-week periods of operation at other starch:dye
   ratios. Most colour removal occurred in the UASB reactor (1 d HRT), and
   the BOD:COD of the UASB reactor effluent increased by up to 47\%. The
   maximum overall COD removal was 88\% and the BOD removal was up to 99\%.
   A maximum of 77\% colour removal overall was achieved with starch and
   dye concentrations of 3.8 and 0.15 g 1(-1), giving a final true colour
   of 0.21 TCU. At both 0.15 and 0.75 g 1(-1) dye a starch concentration of
   3.8 g 1(-1) rather than 1.9 g 1(-1) gave a significant improvement in
   colour removal. However, at 3.8 g 1(-1) starch volatile fatty acid
   levels in the UASB reactor rose, while at 2.9 g 1(-1) starch they did
   not. It is recommended that if colour removal efficiency decreases,
   carbohydrate should be added to the anaerobic reactor at a maximum
   sludge loading rate between 0.11 and 0.15 kg COD kg(-1) TVS d(-1). (C)

   Chemical Oxygen Demand (SCOD), Soluble Total Organic Carbon (STOC),
   particle size, protein. ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N), total phosphorus
   (T-P), and alkalinity. This research showed that solubilization of WAS
   is effective to the digester performance through measuring the unit gas
   production, volatile fatty acids (VFA), pH, and volatile mass reduction
   efficiency. WAS pretreatment allowed a decrease in the digester SRT from
   13 to 6 days, without major effects on process efficiency and on
   effluent quality. It enhanced volatile mass reduction and unit gas
   production. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper covers the testing and evaluation of the impact an
   ion-exchange water softener has on the microbiological quality of water.
   Water quality was assessed iii two situations, firstly in normal
   domestic use and secondly under microbial shock loading conditions in
   the laboratories at Cranfield University. This study was undertaken to
   determine whether the passage of water through an ion-exchange softener
   would lead to a significant change in the total bacterial count of the
   softened water. Samples taken from the outlet of the water softener had
   on average higher total viable count (TVCs) than samples taken from the
   inlet. The average inlet TVC was 300 CFU/ml whilst the average outlet
   TVC was 1330 CFU/ml, a less than 1 log increase in CFU/ml between inlet
   and outlet. This trend was the same for samples incubated at both 22 and
   37 degrees C. There was nc evidence for proliferation of coliform and/or
   Pseudomonas species in the water softener. Tests were undertaken to
   investigate what effect periods of stagnation and regeneration had on
   the TVC. These tests showed no significant increase in colony counts
   after 20 days' stagnation. As expected, regeneration led to decreased
   colony counts in the softened water. To further test whether the water
   softener could act as a growth site for micro-organisms, a series of
   microbial shock loading experiments were undertaken using a 90 litre
   batch solution containing 1.90 x 10(5) Escherica coli/ml. Tests showed
   that after day 1 there was no E. coli in the softened water although
   there was a steady increase in the total viable count. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Simultaneous removal of Cr(VI) and phenol was investigated in an

   organism, Escherichia coli ATCC 33456. Neither E. coli nor the anaerobic
   phenol-degrading consortium culture was acclimated to Cr(VI) prior to
   the batch experiments. Optimum Cr(VI) reduction was observed at a phenol
   concentration of 200 mg/l at an initial Cr(VI) concentration of 2.0
   mg/l. The interaction between E. coli and phenol-degraders was observed
   by varying initial concentrations of chromate, phenol and
   phenol-degrader/E. coli ratio in the anaerobic consortium Higher
   phenol-degrader/E. coli ratios resulted in higher rates of Cr(VI)
   reduction. The highest observed cumulative Cr(VI) reduced per unit
   weight of metabolite utilized by E. coli (1.25 mg Cr(VI);mg organic
   acids consumed) approximated the theoretical value (1.32 mg Cr(VI)/mg
   organic acids consumed). A positive correlation noted between phenol
   degradation and Cr(VI) reduction indicated that E. coli utilized
   metabolites formed from phenol degradation as electron donors for Cr(VI)
   reduction. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation of aqueous aromatic compounds with hydroxyl radical produced
   by Fenton chemistry is inhibited by dissolved fulvic acid. The degree of
   inhibition is significantly greater than that expected, based on a
   simple model in which the Fraction of aromatic compound bound to fulvic
   acid is considered to be unreactive. The reaction of three aromatic
   compounds (phenol, fluorine, and phenanthrene) with hydroxyl radical was
   monitored as a function of Suwannee River fulvic acid concentration.
   Steady state hydroxyl radical concentration was produced by Fenton
   chemistry (H2O2 + Fe2+ --> Fe3+ + HO- + HO .) with continuous addition
   of hydrogen peroxide to Fe2+ solutions. Separation of the hydroxyl
   radical formation sites from the location of the: aromatic compound is
   believed to be the reason for the observed reduction in rate constants,
   indicating that these systems are heterogeneous on a microenvironmental
   scale. The larger than expected inhibition of Fenton degradation by
   fulvic acid indicates that natural organic matter presents a significant
   impediment to remediation of pollutants in natural waters and soils. (C)

Abstract = {{The effect of organic carbon content on the sequential reductive
   dehalogenation of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) in landfill leachates was
   studied using anaerobic microcosms. Microcosms were constructed using
   leachates from adjacent landfill cells which differed in age and organic
   carbon content. The landfill which was sampled had no history of
   contamination with chloroaliphatic (CAH) compounds. Dehalogenation was
   measured in both unamended leachate and in leachate supplemented with a
   mixture of organic carbon compounds. Results showed that significant
   degradation of PCE occurred within 14 days in ail cases, and that most
   or ail of the PCE was dehalogenated to TCE, cis 1,2-DCE, and/or vinyl
   chloride by the 30th day. The extent of dehalogenation was correlated
   with the availability or quality of organic carbon in the leachates. as
   measured by BOD analysis. Supplementation with exogenous carbon promoted
   degradation in the low carbon leachate From the older landfill cell, but
   not the higher carbon leachate from the younger cell. Conversely,
   accumulation of cis-1,2-DCE occurred in the unsupplemented and
   supplemented leachate from the younger cell, but not in supplemented
   leachate from the older cell. In general, our findings show that
   landfill communities may be well adapted for the degradation of CAH
   contaminants, even without prior contamination by these compounds, and
   that the amount of organic carbon able to serve as an electron donor may
   be the most important factor influencing rates of CAH removal via
   dehalogenation. Moreover, supplementation with exogenous sources of
   organic carbon appears to be a viable method for enhancing rates of CAH
   degradation in carbon-limited landfills. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper describes the possibility of a rapid and sensitive in vivo
   bioassay for assessing the endocrine-disrupting potential of effluent
   from wastewater treatment plants. The bioassay uses vitellogenin
   (Vg)-like gene expression in the liver of male zebrafish (Danio rerio).
   Adult male zebrafish were exposed to either 1 mu M carcinogenic
   3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) or 1 mu M IT beta-estradiol (E2) at 25
   degrees C for 48 h. The amplification of VE-like mRNA by reverse
   transcriptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was then examined by
   using a newly designed primer pair and the total RNA extracted from the
   liver of the zebrafish. The results showed that 3-MC could induce
   vitellogenesis, as could E2. This suggests that this procedure is
   applicable as a rapid and sensitive irt vivo bioassay. It also suggests
   that carcinogenic compounds such as 3-MC can disrupt the endocrine
   system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Nitrogen removal in a modified anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR): 1,
   denitrification}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2413-2422}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In order to achieve nitrogen removal within a single reactor unit, an
   eight compartment anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) was modified to
   accommodate an in-situ aerobic stage in the penultimate compartment,
   which allowed ammonia oxidation to nitrite and nitrate via
   nitrification, rn theory, the nitrite/nitrate may be recycled to the
   inlet of the ABR and be reduced via denitrification. This paper deals
   with the anoxic denitrification of a nitrate feed, while a later paper
   examines nitrification in the aerobic stage. Denitrification occurred
   almost exclusively in the front two compartments of the anaerobic
   baffled reactor, with rates of 0.335 (82\% reduction) and 0.085 kg
   NO3/kg VSS.d (96\% reduction) in compartments 1 and 2, respectively.
   Denitrification had several positive effects on overall reactor
   performance, and this was due to the following factors: the utilisation
   of an oxidisable electron donor in the form of the feed GOD; increased
   system pH at the reactor inlet thus improving environmental conditions;
   a high hydrogen demand during dissimilatory nitrate reduction to
   ammonium, therefore improving conditions for syntrophic bacteria; and,
   the generation of ammonium from dissimilatory reduction which provided
   slowly growing bacteria at the front of the ABR with a reduced nitrogen
   source. The overall effect of these influences was improved
   hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Denitrification also increased the
   residual COD in the first two compartments, and this was attributed to
   faster growth/decay rates of denitrifying bacteria. Nitrate reduction
   also influenced the ratio of volatile fatty acids produced and
   catabolised, with a significant reduction in propionate and butyrate,
   while acetate levels increased. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The oxidation of ammonia to nitrite/nitrate using chemolithoautotrophic
   nitrifying bacteria immobilised in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) cubes and
   placed within an aerobic stage of a modified anaerobic baffled reactor
   (ABR) was investigated. Various system parameters known to affect
   nitrification were tested to determine the viability of the process.
   Nitrification efficiency was improved by increased mixing, increased
   oxygen levels and the initial addition of copper. In contrast,
   nitrification was reduced by; a reduction in bulk ammonia levels, a
   reduction in pH, continued copper addition and COD levels above 1000
   mg/l. Whilst immobilisation appeared to protect against un-ionised
   ammonia, it simultaneously increased the saturation constant K(s) for
   both oxygen and ammonia by orders of magnitude. Consequentially, the
   bacteria could survive in abnormally high bulk ammonia concentrations
   with no signs of inhibition, but were limited for oxygen below a partial
   pressure of 0.42 atm, and for ammonia below 160 mg NH(3)/l. A series of
   non-typical trends became evident during this work: the continued
   dependence of nitrite oxidation on the performance of ammonia oxidation;
   persistently low bulk nitrite concentrations; the ability of the pellets
   to produce high levels of nitrate even when bulk un-ionised ammonia
   concentrations were orders of magnitude higher than the inhibition
   coefficient for Nitrobacter; and, the high sensitivity of the bacteria
   to low concentrations of ammonia and oxygen. These results were due to
   significant increases in apparent K(s) values for both groups, and were
   in accordance with reduced diffusion coefficients for the pellets. These
   findings were then used to propose a layered structure for the pellets,
   and in conjunction with other work on denitrification in an ABR, lay the
   basis for an integrated nitrogen removal technique in a single reactor.

   At a 6-h hydraulic retention time (HRT) and an organic loading rate

   containing maleic, oxalic, or fumaric acids separately at organic
   loading rates (B-v) of between 1.8 and 5 kgCOD m(-3) d(-1) COD was also
   treated, with 90-98\% COD removal at HRTs between 8 and 12 h. A mixture

Abstract = {{An open recirculating cooling-water system feeding a modified Robbin's
   Device (MRD) with synthetic cooling water to simulate the environment of
   a recirculating industrial cooling-water system was set up. Both mild
   steel and Nylon coupons were inserted to sample biofilms at regular
   intervals. The community structure was determined by in situ
   hybridization using fluorescently labelled 16 S and 23 S rRNA-targeted
   oligonucleotide probes specific for the beta-, gamma- and delta
   subclasses of the Proteobacteria, as well as probes specific for the
   genera Shewanella, Aeromonas and Pseudomonas. A Cy5 labelled eubacterial
   probe was used in conjunction with other probes to overcome the problems
   experienced with autofluorescence. Due to the weak fluorescent signals
   obtained, biofilm samples were treated with glucose, yeast extract and
   chloramphenicol before fixation, to allow the cell volume and ribosome
   count to increase while suppressing cell division. The predominant
   bacteria in biofilms in the recirculating cooling-water systems were
   found to be members of the beta Proteobacteria (ca 50\% of total
   bacteria observed with EUB 338) and unidentified large cocci, whereas
   gamma Proteobacteria were only observed occasionally (ca 10\% of total
   bacteria observed with EUB 338). At first no Pseudomonas were detected,
   but after the glucose, yeast extract and chloramphenicol treatment, ca
   5\% of the gamma Proteobacteria present were found to be Pseudomonas.
   Shewanella putrefaciens were present in low numbers (ca 10\% of the
   gamma Proteobacteria present), although well distributed. We did not
   observe any sulphate-reducing bacteria or Aeromonas. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of cyanide on the anaerobic treatment of synthetic
   wastewater, containing starch and Volatile fatty acids, was evaluated. A
   laboratory-scale UASB reactor, operated at hydraulic retention time of
   12 h, was successfully acclimatised to CN influent levels as high as 125
   mg l(-1). Evaluation of cyanide levels in the effluent demonstrated
   removal efficiencies of this compound of between 91 and 93\% at
   volumetric CN loading rates of about 250 mg l d(-1). First addition of
   CN at 5 mg l(-1) and subsequent sudden increases in influent CN levels
   during the acclimatisation process resulted in temporary deterioration
   of reactor performance in terms of methane production and COD
   conversion, while CN levels in the effluent were temporarily increased.
   Recovery from CN inhibition was observed within 3-4 weeks, when effluent
   CN levels decreased again below about 10 mg l(-1). Sludge activity
   measurements demonstrated an increased tolerance against CN, once sludge
   had been acclimatised to this toxic compound. The effect of CN
   inhibition on methanogenic activity was more pronounced for acetoclastic
   than for hydrogenotrophic methanogens. The findings of this study
   demonstrate the potential of anaerobic treatment for COD removal in CN
   contaminated waste waters. The results also suggest a potential
   application specifically for CN removal from waste streams. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The occurrence of substances inhibiting nitrification in Swedish
   municipal wastewaters was investigated using three methods: a screening
   method based on activated sludge and two pure culture methods based on
   Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter. Influent samples from 109 wastewater
   treatment plants collected every day during one specific week were
   investigated. The three test methods were also compared. The results of
   the screening method showed that about 60\% of the plants received
   wastewater containing inhibitory substances, although only 4\% had
   considerable inhibition (>20\%). With the two pure culture methods,
   inhibition was found at about 45\% of the plants investigated, with
   considerable inhibition found at 13\% and 20\% of the plants with the
   Nitrosomonas and the Nitrobacter methods, respectively. The limit of
   detection was determined to be 5\% inhibition for the screening method,
   11\% inhibition for the Nitrosomonas method and 13\% inhibition for the
   Nitrobacter method. The pure culture methods found more samples strongly
   inhibitory or stimulating than the screening method. The highest
   correlation between the inhibition results from the three methods was
   found between the screening method and the Nitrosomonas method. It was
   also shown for sludge from several activated sludge treatment plants,
   that they were adapted to the toxic compounds present in the influent.
   At high inhibition this acclimatisation was less pronounced. No
   correlation was found for any of the methods between the inhibition and
   parameters such as the size of the plant, the geographic location, the
   content of ammonia, COD or conductivity in the influent, the presence of
   leachate or the percentage of industrial wastewater in the influent, or
   types of industries in the catchment area. However, the constantly
   highest inhibition was found at a plant with a large number of different
   industries connected. Any clear pattern for the variation of inhibition
   during the week was not found. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A microscale biosensor for nitrate/nitrite was used for in-situ
   monitoring in an activated sludge plant. The biosensor is based on
   diffusion of nitrate/nitrite through a tip membrane into a dense mass of
   bacteria converting the ions into nitrous oxide with subsequent
   electrochemical detection. The biosensor signal was in very close
   agreement with the nitrate/nitrite concentration in the plant as
   analysed by conventional laboratory techniques. The concentration of the
   only interfering substance, nitrous oxide, was so low that it did not
   have any effect. The response time of the applied biosensors was less
   than 30 s, and the detection limit was less than 50 mu g N l(-1).
   Detachment of the ion-permeable membrane in the tip ol these

Abstract = {{Tetramethylammonium (TMA) and hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA)
   cations, applied to Na+-saturated zeolites (clinoptilolite, heulandite,
   chabazite) in doses varying from 0-150\% of the mineral cation exchange
   capacity (CEC), were used to elucidate the mechanisms of adsorption of
   tailoring cations, as well as to determine the potential of
   organically-tailored zeolites for removal of approximately 40 mg/l of
   deprotonated dehydroabietic acid (DHA) dissolved in aqueous solution (pH
   7.25). Langmuir-type adsorption isotherms indicated that both TMA and
   HDTMA cations, applied in doses less than the mineral external CEC
   (ECEC), were firmly bound by electrostatic forces on only the external
   surfaces of zeolite. HDTMA cations improved the DHA uptake capacity of
   heulandite and, chabazite by twenty-fold, ensuring 100\% removal of DHA
   with 20 g/l of tailored aggregates. Analysis of factorial experiments
   indicated that partitioning of DHA into the hydrophobic HDTMA layer was
   strongly dependent on the mineral concentration (41\% of model
   variability), while the effects of cation loading, initial DI-IA
   concentration and aggregate size were marginal (9\%). Over the range
   examined, temperature and time of treatment did not affect DHA removal.
   These initial premising results provide a rationale for further research
   aimed at investigating removal of extractives present in pulp and paper
   waste waters. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The contribution of suspended soil as a source of potentially
   bioavailable P in runoff water was investigated by anion exchange resin
   (AER) extraction. The samples were also analysed for total P (TP) and
   dissolved reactive P (DRP). Particulate P (PP) was calculated by
   subtracting DRP from TP, and reversibly adsorbed particulate P (PPi) by
   subtracting DRP from AER-P. The material consisted of 154 surface runoff
   samples, collected from four arable clay soils in southern Finland.
   Total P and PPi correlated closely with TSS, but DRP did not. When the
   TSS concentration increased, the increasing proportion of AER-P
   consisted of PPI. In runoff low in TSS (0.2-0.5 g l(-1)), PPi
   constituted 12-23\% of AER-P: the dominant fraction (77-88\%) of AER-P
   being DRP. When the TSS concentration increased, PPi became an important
   contributor to potentially bioavailable P, accounting for 35-69\% of.
   AER-P when TSS was 1.0-2.5 g l(-1). The average amount of PPI in
   suspended soil material ranged from 39 to 165 mg kg(-1) at different
   sites, depending on soil P status. If PPi is not taken into account, P
   bioavailability in turbid runoff may be severely underestimated. (C)

Title = {{Phosphate and ammonium distribution in a pilot-scale constructed wetland
   with horizontal subsurface flow using shale as a substrate}},

Abstract = {{Phosphate: (P) and ammonium (N) distributions were investigated in a
   pilot-scale constructed wetland system (CWS) with horizontal flow. Shale
   was selected as a substrate, on the basis of its P adsorption capacity
   as well as its suitability for plant growth, investigated in an earlier
   study. The system was set up in a greenhouse, and comprised of four
   tanks with and four tanks without Phragmites australis (common reed).
   Sampling ports were installed along the length of each tank, and at
   three different depths, in order to facilitate three-dimensional
   monitoring of nutrient distribution over the period of study (il
   months).
   In the planted systems, H2PO4--P (ortho-P) and NH4+-N concentrations
   were low (0.5-1.0 g m(-3)) at all depths throughout their length.
   Generally, ortho-P and NH4+-N concentrations decreased exponentially
   along the transect from the tank inlet to the outlet. In the unplanted
   systems, higher values (0.5-16.5 g m(-3)) of ortho-P were observed.
   NH4+-N in the unplanted systems was relatively high (10-30 g m(-3))
   throughout the period of investigation. In both planted and unplanted
   tanks, NO3--N concentrations were very low at the inlets (0.02-0.05 g
   m(-3)), and increased only slightly towards the outlets. Although the
   presence of P. australis had a significant effect (p < 0.05) on P and N
   concentrations at all depths and along the length of the tanks, the
   nutrient distribution followed the same trend as in unplanted tanks.
   The results were consistent with the theoretical removal model which
   predicts an exponential decrease in pollutant concentrations to a
   background value approaching zero along the transect from wetland inlet
   to the outlet. A modification of the model was suggested where a first
   order area-based reduction rate constant k (m d(-1)) would be replaced
   with (k(p) + k(s)), k(p) representing the rate constant for the removal
   by the plants, and k(s) the rate constant for the removal by the
   substrate, and associated microbial populations they support.
   Approximate values for k(p) + k(s) Of 0.084 m d(-1) (P) and 0.065 m
   d(-1) (N) and for k(s) of 0.069 m d(-1) (P) and 0.034 m d(-1) (N) were
   obtained.
   The hydraulic residence time, now characteristics and permeability of
   the shale was investigated by a bromide (Br-) tracer. The tracer
   breakthrough curves showed a similar pattern in all tanks, with about
   66\% of the now occurring through the bottom zone (0.35 m). The actual
   hydraulic residence time (6 days) was slightly higher than the nominal
   one.
   The tracer study also enabled the calculation of the volumetric rate
   constants, k(v) and approximate values of 0.075 d(-1) (P) and 0.060
   d(-1)(N) were obtained for planted and 0.061 d(-1)(P) and 0.020 d(-1)(N)
   for unplanted tanks.
   The results obtained from this pilot scale study, provide a better
   understanding of nutrient distribution and flow patterns that take place
   within CWS, and should enable more rational design parameters to be
   developed that help to optimise future large-scale systems. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{There are currently numerous point-of-use (POU) devices on the market
   claiming to inactivate micro-organisms including Cryptosporidium. In
   order to protect public health it is important that these devices be
   evaluated using the most sensitive and specific methodology available. A
   point-of-use device trade marked ``PureBright(R){''} that utilizes
   ``pulsed light{''} was characterized using the United States
   Environmental Protection Agency Guide Standard and Protocol for Testing
   Microbiological Water Purifiers. The unit was challenged with Klebsiella
   terrigena, polio virus type 1 strain Lsc2ab, simian rotavirus SA11 and
   Cryptosporidium parvum. The unit was tested over 8 days which included
   two 48-h stagnation periods. The PureBright unit was run at the
   manufacturer's recommended flow rate of 15.14 l/min (4 gal/min). Each
   microbial challenge consisted of 75.71 of influent water containing
   10(5) CFU:ml of Klebsiella, 10(4) PFU/ml of polio and rotavirus and
   10(4) oocysts/ml of Cryptosporidium. Influent and effluent samples were
   collected and assayed using standard methods for the detection of viable
   bacteria (membrane filtration) and viruses (cell culture). Viable
   Cryptosporidium oocysts were determined using vital dyes, excystation,
   cell culture and animal infectivity. The PureBright unit was able to
   achieve a > 7 log(10) inactivation of Klebsiella, a > 4 log(10)
   inactivation of polio and rotavirus and a > 4 log(10) inactivation of
   Cryptosporidium parvum using relatively good quality influent water.
   Cell culture and animal infectivity analysis were shown to be equivalent
   in determining C. parvum viability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Biological nitrogen removal in activated sludge processes is
   conventionally obtained by a sequence of aerobic and anoxic processes.
   Kinetic mechanisms affecting the oxygen balance could trigger the
   production of total volatile organic carbon (TVOC) and nitric brides
   (NO) under anoxic and anaerobic conditions. Measurements at a wastewater
   treatment pilot plant of capacity 1.6 m(3) wastewater show that the
   amount of TVOC and NO produced during the treatment process depends on
   carbon loading (low feed, balanced acid overloaded) and aeration
   conditions. To confirm the results ORP, pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) are
   measured on-line and chemical parameters such as nitrate (NO3-N),
   ammonium (NH4-N) and TOC are measured in the wastewater.
   The ORP observed is in the range of -60 and + 198 mV includes optimal
   setpoints for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification. From the
   pattern of NO emission plot, it can be assumed that a part of the
   produced NO3-N is denitrified during the aeration period. NO emissions
   are especially high during denitrification conditions at low oxygen
   rates. The results suggest that both NO and TVOC emission concentrations
   in combination with ORP can be valuable parameters to control operation
   of a wastewater treatment plant. Continuous measurements of ORP and NO
   concentrations for estimation of NO emissions gauging the extent of
   nitrification or denitrification in the plant becomes possible. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{To investigate the use of dispersants as an oil spill chemical
   countermeasure in the surf-zone, a simulated oil spill was conducted at
   the Shoreline Environmental Research Facility (SERF), formerly known as
   the Coastal OilSpill Simulation System (COSS), a wave tank facility in
   Corpus Christi, Texas. Sand was added to each tank to establish a beach
   with a prescribed slope of 10 degrees. Natural seawater flowed
   continually through the system to emulate alongshore currents. The
   replicated experimental treatments included pre-mixed oil plus
   dispersant (three tanks), oil only (three tanks), and unoiled controls
   (two tanks). Known amounts of either whole oil or dispersed oil were
   added to the respective tanks. Both the sediment and water column were
   periodically sampled during the 10-day experiment, and a materials
   balance on the oil was determined for both oil treatments. The
   environmental compartments where oil accumulated were sediments, water
   column, and non-aqueous-phase layer. The discharge from the tanks was
   presumed to be the primary sink, as water was drawn from the tanks at a
   known and constant flow rate. Tidal cycles were simulated by varying the
   computer-controlled influent rate. The oil mass (measured as total
   petroleum hydrocarbons) for each compartment/sink was calculated using
   data from four time points. At the experiment's conclusion,
   approximately 49\% of the applied oil for the oiled treatment remained
   in the tanks sorbed to sediments or other surfaces. The rest of the oil
   was removed via the effluent. In the chemically-dispersed oil treatment,
   all of the oil was flushed From the tanks; no oil (much less than 1\%)
   remained on the sediments. These studies indicate that a timely
   dispersant application to spilled oil can reduce residual oil
   accumulation on beach substrates. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The kinetics of the cementation of lead from acidic solutions onto
   rotating iron discs have been studied over a large range of initial lead
   ion concentrations, disc rotation speeds and temperatures. The
   cementation is shown to be a first-order reaction which is

Abstract = {{One of the main reasons for failing of the sedimentation process in
   activated sludge waste water treatment systems is the phenomenon of
   filamentous bulking. This occurs when filamentous bacteria overgrow
   Roc-forming bacteria, in this paper mathematical models are discussed
   which describe the competition of Aocs and filaments based on the
   kinetic selection theory. It is proven with a stability analysis for a
   continuous reactor, that, in order to control filamentous bulking, the
   dilution rate plays a crucial role. Moreover, it is shown that
   coexistence of both organisms is generically not possible. Afterwards
   the continuous reactor model is extended in order to describe a standard
   waste water treatment system. Due to the complexity of the extended
   model it is difficult to perform the stability analysis analytically. It
   is proven that the model can be reduced without loss of stability
   properties. For the reduced model it is proven with a stability analysis
   that the transport terms play a crucial role in the survival of one or
   the other organism. As for the continuous reactor model it is shown that
   coexistence of both organisms is generically not possible. (C) 2000

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2542-2550}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a technique which enables on-line monitoring of
   activated sludge flocculation. The usefulness of this technique is
   demonstrated by investigating the effect of shear on steady-state floc
   sizes. The technique is based on a method developed to investigate
   flocculation of inorganic particles. Samples of activated sludge are
   sonicated for 3 min at 50 W to produce the necessary primary particles
   to observe flocculation. The samples are then stirred in a batch mixing
   vessel and sized on-line using a Malvern Mastersizer/E.
   The dynamics of flocculation were found to be reproducible and follow
   the principles of inorganic shear induced flocculation. The median flee
   size was found to increase until an equilibrium between the rates of
   aggregation and breakage was reached. At this point, a steady-state floc
   size was maintained.
   The effect of shear on the steady-state flee size was quantified using
   the experimental technique. The change in floc size-with shear followed
   a power law relationship. This relationship was used to investigate the
   breakage mechanisms. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Extracellular aminopeptidase activity and microbial leucine
   assimilation, both processes related to protein degradation and

   sewage-works discharges, The rivers studied were the Swale, and its
   tributary the Wiske in which there was less dilution of effluent.
   Localized increase in planktonic leucine aminopeptidase activity and
   leucine assimilation, associated with increased bacterioplankton
   abundance, potentially enhanced biopurification in both rivers. In
   contrast, epilithic leucine aminopeptidase activity was not consistently
   elevated in response to discharges. Epilithic leucine assimilation and
   bacterial abundance did, however, tend to increase; this response might
   have favoured biopurification, despite the lack of enhanced
   aminopeptidase activity. General downstream increase in aminopeptidase
   activity and amino-acid assimilation, previously described along the
   Swale, was shown not to be a simple response- to successive sewage-works
   discharges. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrations of dissolved and particulate metals (Cu, Zn and Cd) were
   determined in water samples collected during several rain events from
   the River Kleine Aa, a first order tributary to Lake Sempach (Central
   Switzerland). Metal contents were also measured in soil cores obtained
   from fertilized and unfertilized areas of the catchment and in liquid
   manure samples. The contribution of farming activities to the metal
   loads was evaluated.
   Because total metal concentrations were linearly related to water
   discharge, rain events significantly contribute to the yearly metal
   load. During such events, metals were predominantly associated to
   particles, but dissolved copper constituted up to half of the Cu load at
   low flow rates. Dissolved Cu concentrations exceeded dissolved Zn
   concentrations at low discharge rates, and in experimental water
   extracts of the grassland soil. The dynamic behavior of dissolved metals
   and dissolved organic carbon were linked in the river water and in the
   soil extracts. Metal concentration of suspended particles decreased with
   increasing discharge to a constant level with Cu and Zn contents similar
   to those of the grassland topsoil. Their Cd content was, however, lower
   than in the soil. These observations suggest that the grassland topsoil
   is the main source of dissolved and particulate trace metals in the
   river water.
   Farming activities have caused metal accumulation, since the metal
   contents in the grassland soil were highest at the surface and higher
   than in the forest soil at any depth. Based on a metal budget of the
   drainage area and on metal profiles of forest and grassland soil, it is
   concluded that frequent application of liquid manure with high metal
   concentrations was mainly responsible for the high Cu and Zn content of
   the soil and the elevated loss rates to the river, whereas air pollution
   mainly explained the elevated Cd load of the drainage basin and the
   river water. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Oxygen absorption into water and waste water is an important process
   taking place with both natural and technical means, and a tool for a
   theoretical determination of the oxygen transfer coefficient, K-L, is
   desirable.
   The objective of this investigation was to study the environment at and
   near the liquid side of a gas-liquid interface in order to present a
   model for a theoretical determination of K-L. The gas was pure oxygen
   and the liquids were clean tap water and various concentrations of two
   types of tenside solutions. Various sized hemispherical oxygen bubbles
   were impressed by various liquid how velocities while measuring the
   liquid how velocity and the film thickness using a Laser Doppler
   Anemometer (LDA). The LDA was also used to determine K-L Furthermore,
   the surface tension and the bulk kinematic viscosity for various liquids
   were measured.
   For clean tap water it was Found that the Two Film Theory by Lewis and
   Whitmann {[}(1924) Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, 16(12),
   1215-1220] had to be modified, and that K-L can be calculated from a
   correspondingly modified version of an equation presented by Dobbins
   {[}(1956) Biological Treatment of Sewage and Industrial Wastes, Section
   2, eds B. J. McCabe and W. W. Eckenfelder Jr, pp. 141-148. Reinhold
   publishing Corp., New York]. The calculation is based on a theoretical
   determination of the liquid film thickness with respect to normal Row
   which is also presented in this paper.
   For tenside solutions it was found that ICL is a function of the
   relative flow velocity (nu(r)) (K-L increases with increasing nu(r)
   until a certain limit), the bubble size (K-L decreases with increasing
   bubble size), and the surface tension (K-L decreases with decreasing
   surface tension) but not the kinematic viscosity of the bulk, However,
   it was not possible to present a thorough calculation model.
   A more detailed description of the investigation is given in Pedersen
   {[}(1998) A study of liquid film, liquid motion, and oxygen absorption
   from hemispherical air/oxygen bubbles. Ph.D. thesis, Brunel University,

Abstract = {{In many locations nitrogen (N) addition to the environment is of-concern
   because of the existing quality or intended use of groundwater. To
   address this concern we evaluated the impact of residence time on N
   removal in constructed wetlands employed to treat domestic wastewater.
   Constructed subsurface flow (SF) wetlands were installed at two
   locations for this study. Twelve small, II gravel-based, SF wetlands
   were constructed at the Virginia Tech's Kentland Research Farm (KRF).
   Treatments included combinations of two plant species {[}woolgrass
   (Scirpus cyperinus) and cattail (Typha latifolia)] and three residence
   times (2.6, 3.9 and 5.9 days). Twelve larger SF wetlands were
   constructed at the Powell River Project (PRP) site. Treatments at the
   PRP site consisted of the same plant species and three residence times
   (4, 8 and 12 days). The wastewater at both sites was septic Lank
   effluent (STE) from a single family residence.
   Changes in ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), and total Kjeldahl N (TKN)
   were determined by monitoring influent and effluent quality over a
   3-year period. Plant species had little impact on N concentration or
   removal. Both NP4+ and TKN concentrations in the wetlands decreased
   exponentially with increased residence time. Removal of NH4+ and TKN
   ranged from 18.1 to 39.0\% and from 31.3 to 45.8\%, respectively, for
   the KRF site and from 44.4 to 73.4\% and from 46.2 to 67.5\%,
   respectively, at the PRP site. The NO3- concentrations in the influent
   and effluent at both sites were low and no differences in concentrations
   with residence time was observed.
   Temperature dependent rate constants (K-T). developed from NH4+-N and
   TKN data collected from the KRF site, was effective in predicting NP4+-N
   and TKN concentrations as a function of residence time in the wetlands
   at the PRP site. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment costs and cost effectiveness of a hollow-fiber nanofiltration
   (HFNF) system vs. an integrated system comprised of, spiral-wound
   nanofiltration (SWNF) pre-treated with hollow-fiber ultrafiltration
   (HFUF) are estimated and compared using numerical simulation and cost
   modeling. Optimal selections are investigated based on the cost
   effectiveness of the two treatment options over different raw water
   conditions and for different plant capacities. Recently developed
   permeate flux and cost models were used to simulate the membrane
   systems. Values for operating parameters used in the simulations were
   chosen from previously reported pilot studies. For relatively smaller
   (less than or equal to 1 mgd) plants, a NFNF system that can handle
   higher solids loading is predicted be the cost effective treatment
   option, due to the associated lower non-membrane capital costs that form
   the dominant component of total treatment costs at smaller capacities.
   However, when the raw water is largely characterized by particles with a
   very high Fouling potential for the single HFNF step, separate HFUF
   pre-treatment for particulate removal may be warranted. Al higher plant
   capacities, economies of scale are shown to be significantly realized in
   non-membrane capital costs, and the integrated HFUF-SWNF configuration
   is predicted to become increasingly cost effective due to the cost
   advantages of spiral-wound membranes. Hence, optimal design philosophies
   with regard to cost effectiveness may be quite different for small and
   large membrane plants. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Increasingly stringent effluent nitrogen criteria require that
   appropriate assessments of denitrification rates be made to facilitate
   the design of wastewater treatment systems. A zero-headspace reactor was
   used in comparative denitrification studies as a reference system that
   totally excludes oxygen. An open reactor and a reactor with a floating
   lid were also operated simultaneously to determine how oxygen input into
   typical laboratory reactors might influence observed denitrification
   results. Preclarified influent and activated sludge from a denitrifying
   domestic wastewater treatment plant were used as the carbon and biomass
   source, and KNO3 was used as the nitrate source. The impact of oxygen
   penetration proved to be highly dependent on the denitrification rate.
   The influence of the design of the experimental system was small when
   rapid nitrate consumption occurred, whereas oxygen penetration had a
   severe impact at low denitrification rates. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Previously, we reported interference due to several ozone-scavenging
   reagents (OSRs) in the quantitation of aldehydes using
   O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)oxylamine (PFBOA) in the analysis of
   ozonated waters. Scavenging ozone is essential if ozonation byproduct
   concentrations are to be fixed in time, which is required in a study of
   formation as a function of time; otherwise, additional redox reactions
   can rake place prior to analysis. We have since determined that
   triphenylphosphine and indigo-5,5',7-trisulfonate can be satisfactory
   OSRs. Both PPh3 and indigo-5,5',7-trisulfonate react rapidly with ozone,
   i.e., within 10 s. Triphenylphosphine is insoluble in water and must be
   dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent (e.g., benzene) that can be
   dispersed into the sample. When PFBOA is added directly, several minutes
   must elapse to completely scavenge the ozone, making this approach
   unsatisfactory. Procedures for using these OSRs are described, and
   quantitative results are explained. Although PPh3 and
   indigo-5,5',7-trisulfonate produce deviations relative to controls
   devoid of OSRs, the biases are precise and therefore readily corrected
   for by subjecting calibration standards and analyte-fortified (spiked)
   samples to the same analytical procedure. Published by Elsevier Science

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{The long duration of the start-up period is a major drawback of the
   anaerobic wastewater treatment systems. A better understanding of the
   factors affecting biomass aggregation and adhesion, the two main
   mechanisms of biomass retention, could make the start-up more efficient
   and rapid. The objective of the present work is to determine the effect
   of the carbon:nitrogen ratio on the efficiency of biomass retention in
   upflow anaerobic filters. For this purpose, two substrates of two
   different C:N ratios (nitrogen limited, NL, and nitrogen balanced, NE)
   were considered. In fed-batch operation it was shown that a nitrogen
   limitation in the very first phase of reactor start-up seems to enhance
   appreciably biomass adhesion. A feeding strategy to upflow anaerobic
   filters, consisting on maintaining a N limitation during the first two
   weeks resulted in a moro efficient biomass retention, with a higher
   specific methanogenic activity. By using this policy, the total
   methanogenic capacity attained after 4 weeks exceeded that obtained in
   the system fed with the balanced substrate from the beginning of the
   operation by 20\%. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ali rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus transferred from land to water is a major problem across the
   world. Identifying the source of phosphorus in water is an important
   prerequisite to the development of remedial strategies. In this paper,
   key aspects of phosphorus transfer from grazing land to water are
   reviewed along with the techniques that may be used to trace its origin.
   Dissolution and erosion are the two processes that can mobilise
   phosphorus. Erosion is the physical transport of sediment, arbitrarily
   defined as materials that do not pass through a 0.45 mu m filter, while
   dissolution is the transport of phosphorus either chemically dissolved
   in water or attached to colloidal material capable of passing through a
   0.45 pm filter.
   Most phosphorus is transported from well managed pastures of southern
   Australia in a dissolved form (<0.45 mu m) and the highest loads
   typically occur in surface runoff.
   Being monoisotopic in its natural state, phosphorus cannot be directly
   traced. However, a range of techniques have been used to identify the
   source of sediment, and by implication, the attached phosphorus
   mobilised by erosion processes. With minor exceptions no such techniques
   are available for tracing phosphorus mobilised by dissolution processes.
   Organic marker compounds (biomarkers) may have useful attributes for
   phosphorus tracing. There are a vast range of biomarker compounds
   including sterols, phospholipids and alkanes, that are specific to
   potential phosphorus sources at a farm scale, and specific to particular
   land uses at a catchment scale (e.g. faeces and both live and decaying
   vegetation). This paper investigates the use of biomarkers to augment
   the current suite of phosphorus tracing techniques at both farm and
   catchment scales. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional coagulation kinetic models are usually based on
   Smoluchowski's work, which employs the coalesced sphere assumption. Much
   evidence, however, has recently been provided that particle aggregates
   from natural waters and engineered systems have fractal structures.
   Consequently, the traditional models should be modified to include the
   fractal nature of aggregates. This paper describes a modeling approach
   that simulates changes in particle size distribution (PSD) due to
   coagulation by incorporating recently proposed fractal mathematics and
   introducing a new conceptual framework called the coalesced fractal
   sphere (CFS) assumption. The developed modeling method, which includes
   the traditional Euclidean case as a subset, was applied to a 2-m
   settling column system with estuarine sediment particles, and a
   one-dimensional numerical model was developed. Model simulations were
   conducted varying the fractal dimension (D-F) and the collision
   efficiency factor (alpha). For the conventional Euclidean case, the
   model indicated that coagulation played an important role in the
   vertical transport of the estuarine sediment particles. The simulations
   with the fractal cases indicated that both D-F and alpha significantly
   affected the evolution of PSD, and that with lower values of D-F and
   alpha the model predicted a trend of PSD similar to that of the
   Euclidean case. This finding may be interpreted as dependence of alpha
   on the assumed collision models (or D-F), that seems to leave a new
   challenge to our understanding of alpha. The developed model may be used
   in various particle aggregation systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Estuarine water samples were collected at the vertical profile on one
   selected station in the Krka river estuary (Croatia) during the period
   from September 1995 to July 1998. The concentrations of reactive and
   total mercury (in the UV-irradiated samples) were measured in unfiltered
   and acidified samples by atomic absorption and show non-conservative
   behavior. The location of the mercury maximum found in the region,
   2-12.5 ngl(-1), changes and is not always at the freshwater/seawater
   interface (FSI) as suggested in earlier estuary studies. The proportion
   of reactive to total mercury, two operational species, also changed,
   depending on salinity, seasonal and weather changes not only in fresh
   water and at the FSI but in some cases in seawater down to the bottom.
   Maximal apparent mercury complexing capacity was determined as 2.7
   ngHgl(-1). Information about surfactant activity in the same vertical
   profile was obtained using a hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE), by
   a.c, out of phase voltammetry at two fixed potentials (-0.2 and -0.6 V).
   Continuous variation of hydrophylic and hydrophobic substances was
   observed. No correlation with the mercury maximum was found. In samples
   showing the total mercury maximum, hydrophobic heterodispersed
   substances (>0.7 mu m) were found, giving evidence that mercury is
   partly bound to particulate organic carbon having hydrophobic
   properties. Submicron colloids and aggregates (10 nm(-l) mu m) were
   directly proved using electronmicroscopy. Characteristic estimated time
   for the coagulation/sedimentation process in the Krka river estuary
   (about 8 days) can be influenced by the strong northerly Bura wind.
   Removal of mercury from the water column was evidenced in winter, when
   extremely low (less than I ngl(-1)) mercury concentrations were found in
   the water column after the very strong Bura wind. During the Jugo wind
   the outflow of brackish water decreases. The current going from sediment
   to FSI accumulates mercury at FSI (12.5 ngl(-1)), predominantly in
   inorganic form. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel porous glass reactor for removal of dissolved oxygen (DO) using
   a reducing agent in ultrapure water production was studied theoretically
   and experimentally. The theoretical model provides a detailed analysis
   of the glass reactor for the DO removal from water. Numerical techniques
   using the finite difference have been employed for the solution of the
   resulting equations. The effects of various operating conditions and
   parameters such as water velocity, operating pressure and reaction rate
   constant on the DO removal have been examined. The simulation results
   indicate that the presence of a chemical reaction will not only improve
   the quality of the ultrapure water, but also dramatically increases the
   reactor capacities for the dissolved oxygen removal. Experimental data
   obtained from the glass reactor developed were compared with the
   theoretical results and capabilities of the reactors for the DO removal

Abstract = {{Microbial metabolism is the sum of biochemical transformation that
   includes interrelated catabolic and anabolic reactions. It has been
   demonstrated that coupling between anabolism and catabolism can be
   seriously dissociated by chemical uncoupler. Based on the knowledge on
   energy uncoupling resulting from substrate excess, a growth yield model
   was developed for chemical uncoupler-containing batch culture of
   activated sludge, and was verified with experimental and literature
   data. The observed growth yield was found to decrease with increasing
   the ratio of initial uncoupler concentration to initial biomass
   concentration (C-u/X-o), which represents the real strength of chemical
   uncoupler exerted on unit biomass. The presence of chemical uncoupler in
   the culture medium can cause significant energy spilling. II appears
   that energy spilling may be an effective pathway for bacteria to protect
   themselves against abnormal living conditions, but at the cost of
   consuming nongrowth energy. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Reduction of bivalent mercury (Hg(II)) by mossy tin combined with Hg(0)
   air stripping has been recently proposed as a method to remove Hg from
   groundwater. We investigated the effectiveness of mossy tin to remove
   Hg(II) from aqueous solution at different flow rates and determined the
   retention of Hg through the formation of HgSn amalgams Results show that
   mossy tin layers of only 2 cm thickness can reduce 100\% of 800 mu g
   Hg(II) l(-1) at a how rate of about 1 Volume of drainable porosity
   min(-1) (Vol min(-1)), and even 100\% of 5000 mu g 1(-1) at 0.125 Vol
   min(-1), 89\% and 97\% of the Hg(0) were retained in the filter through
   amalgamation. No Hg was remobilized from the loaded tin filters by
   chloride (10-50 mg Cl- I-1) or dissolved organic carbon DOC (0.5-6 mg
   DOC l(-1)). The capacity of mossy tin to adsorb Hg was found to be at
   least 5-6\% of the weight of the filter. The study shows that mossy tin
   has a high capacity to remove Hg effectively from aqueous solution.
   Disadvantages arise from the release of tin from the filters exceeding
   legal limits of 20 mu g 1(-1) in most cases but occurred as mostly
   insoluble tin particles or Sn hydroxide. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   sediment core, the amount of potentially mobile P was 5 g/m(2),
   consisting mainly of organic-P (NaOH-nrP) but also of P associated to
   iron (BD-P). P release experiments were performed by maintaining steep
   diffusion gradients in Bow-through chambers under oxic or anoxic
   conditions. Using this method it took no longer than three weeks to
   release an amount of P from the main P mobile pools (NaOH-nrP, BD-P)
   corresponding to P naturally lost during sediment diagenesis, a process
   which normally takes years. Release rates as well as mobile amounts of P
   in the NaOH-nrP pool varied significantly depending on the redox status.
   In conclusion, the release method applied made it possible to determine
   potentially mobile P under specified conditions and to detect
   ecologically important P fractions in the surface sediments. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{An experimental flow system was developed to simulate solute transport
   in heterogeneous porous media, in which physical nonequilibrium occurs.
   The system consists of a column filled with spherical alginate gel
   beads. The gel acts as a stagnant water phase, in which ions can only
   move by diffusion. First, the release of nitrate and phosphate ions from
   the gel beads by diffusion was measured separately, in a batch system.
   Model calculations showed that it is possible to accurately predict the
   release of ions from the gel beads, by applying Picks law for diffusion
   and reported diffusion coefficients of the ions in water. Subsequently,
   the transport of ions in the column was tested against model
   calculations. The breakthrough of nitrate From a bead filled column was
   measured at different flow rates. The breakthrough curves were
   successfully predicted with a two-region model. In this model the
   solution in the beads is represented by an immobile region and the
   solution in the pores by a mobile region. Mass transport takes place by
   convection in the mobile region, and by diffusion in the immobile
   region. The model only requires the following independent input
   parameters: the flow rate, the diffusion coefficient in water, the
   column dimensions and the bead radius. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to adapt protozoans to a saline and crude-oil
   contaminated petrochemical sewage. Wild type protozoans were isolated
   from different marine locations and from a municipal-refinery mixed
   sewage treatment plant. In batch culture the micro-organisms were
   adapted by slowly increasing concentrations of sodium chloride and
   hydrocarbons. No wild type strain survived in the saline sewage. Using
   selected type strains of protozoans as inocula, Cohnilembus, rheniformis
   and Uronema marinum were found to adopt to the brine. In a 20 l-batch
   culture Li. marinum grow up to a number of 14.000 cells ml(-1) Since the
   yield was recognized to be to small for further scale-up, additional
   experiments were done in continuous culture. In a lab-scale 2-step
   continuous culture, inoculated with natural activated sludge mixed
   populations of protozoans, one single species of a ciliated protozoan
   could be enriched and identified as Uronema nigricans. The effluent
   turbidity, measured as optical density (OD600), of the lab-scale
   activated sludge plant decreased dependent on the increase of U.
   nigricans count. In addition, chemical oxygen demand degradation
   efficiency was found to be 45.8\%, compared to 35.4\% in activated
   sludge mixed cultures missing protozoans. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Competition between complexation and adsorption of copper was evaluated
   in raw sewage samples. Dissociation constants of filtered and
   non-filtered samples were calculated by linearization of potentiometric
   titration data using a modified Gran method. Sewage samples were also
   titrated with cupric ions at three different pH values using an ion
   selective electrode to quantify the effect of pH, ligand concentration,
   and particulates in the speciation of copper. Three titratable groups
   with pKa values of 4.45, 6.42, and 9.31 were detected in non-filtered
   samples. Changes in pH showed a marked effect in the concentration of
   free metal caused by the competition between copper and hydrogen ions
   for organic ligands present in raw sewage. Particulate matter as well as
   carbonate did not show a significant contribution to control copper
   speciation in the system. Assuming a two binding sites model,
   conditional stability constants (K') of copper complexes were dependent
   on pH, showing values around log K'(1) = 8.00 and log K'(2) = 6.30 at pH
   5.8, whereas at pH 7.8, these constants increased to log K'(1) = 10.60
   and log K'(2) = 8.70 for filtered samples. Particulates caused small
   changes in K' Values due to adsorption contribution, and this effect was
   minimized in diluted samples. Ligand concentrations varied between 5 and
   10 mu mol l(-1). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Benzene- and naphthalenesulfonates (BS, NS) are xenobiotic, highly
   water-soluble chemical compounds that are used for the production of
   many consumer products such as fluorescent whitening agents, dyes, or
   concrete plasticizers, and for Various applications in industrial
   processes. They are mainly introduced into ambient waters by industrial
   or municipal wastewater directly or following municipal sewage
   treatment. In order to characterize an additional pathway for BS and NS
   into the environment, leachates and groundwater samples collected from
   the pollution plumes of four Swiss landfills were investigated. The
   samples were analyzed using ion-pair liquid chromatography with UV
   absorption and fluorescence detection. Liquid chromatography coupled to
   mass spectrometry was performed for the selective identification of
   aromatic monosulfonates. The results show that landfill sites are point
   sources for BS and NS in the aquatic environment. BS and NS were
   measured in the leachates at a wide concentration range from a few mu g
   l(-1) up to several mg l(-1), depending on the composition of the
   deposited material. Their contribution to the leachate DOC was from
   below 1 parts per thousand up to around 30\%. BS and NS were also found
   in groundwater samples contaminated by percolating leachates. The
   concentrations, which contributed less than 1 parts per thousand to the
   groundwater DOG, ranged from a few ng l(-1) to several mu g l(-1). (C)

Abstract = {{The environmentally harmful compound. nitrous oxide (N2O), can
   accumulate as an intermediate in the process of denitrification. One
   important parameter, which can influence this accumulation, is the
   feeding regime sensed by the bacteria involved, in which an unbalanced
   supply of electron donor and acceptor may occur. When pulse additions of
   C-compounds (acetate, butyrate and malate) were given to denitrifying
   cultures of Alcaligenes faecalis strain TUD, the production rate of N2O
   was reduced from 9.9-18.5\% to 1.8-10.4\% of the total nitrite
   converted, as long as the C-substrate was in excess. However, as soon as
   the availability of carbon compounds became exhausted and the culture
   entered starvation. N2O was one of the main products of denitrification
   and production increased to 32-64\% of the total N-feed. Under dynamic
   feeding conditions, the culture was able to adapt to the fluctuating
   conditions and the ratio of N2O to nitrite decreased. However, during
   starvation the ratio of N2O to nitrite was still high (+/- 27\%),
   indicating that with prolonged starvation, the overall N2O emission will
   increase.
   Competition between the enzymes of denitrification fur electrons from
   the cytochrome c pool could explain the emission of N2O, if the enzyme
   N2O-reductase has a lower affinity for the electron-donor than the other
   reductases. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{occurrence of neurotoxic cyanobacteria and saxitoxins in Danish lakes
   was investigated from 104 phytoplankton samples representing 96
   localities. Mouse bioassays demonstrated neurotoxicity in 11 localities
   (13 samples) of which eight (10 samples) contained saxitoxins and the
   remaining three anatoxin-a(s). The common cyanobacterial neurotoxin
   anatoxin-a was not detected. The toxin profiles of the samples
   containing saxitoxins were characterised using standards of saxitoxin
   (STX), decarbamoyl STX (dcSTX): neoSTX and gonyautoxins 1-5 (GTX1-5).
   Presence of C-toxins was not investigated. The lakes fell into two
   groups, in seven lakes STX was the dominant toxin and in four lakes GTX4
   was dominant. In the first group, STX comprised 46-100\% of the total
   toxin content; in the latter, GTX4 made up 40-75\%. The total toxin
   content varied between 5.9 and 224.1 mu g STX equivalents g DW-1 with
   median at 34.1 mu g STX equivalents g DW-1. Two lakes contained more
   than 100 mu g STX equivalents g DW-1 (182.5 and 224.1 mu g,
   respectively) with STX constituting more than 95\% of the total toxin
   content. Nine of the neurotoxic samples also contained microcystins.
   Most of the samples were totally dominated by cyanobacteria but
   unambiguous identification of toxin-producing species was not possible.
   Anabaena lemmermannii P. Richter was very common in the neurotoxic
   lakes, and it was distinctly dominant in the two lakes with the highest
   total contents of saxitoxins. The high frequency of neurotoxic lakes
   with saxitoxins suggests that these toxins are more common in fresh
   waters than previously assumed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   treatment, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in combination with UV irradiation,
   and UV irradiation only were applied in the oxidation of the DOM
   samples. The impact of the oxidation on the DOM was characterized by
   size exclusion chromatography. UV absorbance, and fluorescence
   spectroscopy. In order to investigate the flocculation properties of the
   DOM before and after oxidation, sedimentation field-flow fractionation
   experiments were performed. The biodegradability was probed in a biofilm
   reactor. Due to the oxidation, the biodegradability and flocculation was
   changed depending on the process applied and the degree of oxidation of

Abstract = {{Soluble cyanide leaches from the spent ore heaps of many gold mines in

   to protect the receiving water from potentially harmful cyanide. A
   sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR) was tested as a mobile, closed

   cyanide degrading microbes were enriched from the Fairbanks, Alaska
   municipal wastewater treatment plant. With a 48-h cycle time, the SBBR
   was capable of removing 20 mg/l of cyanide from a waste stream provided
   156 mg/l of glucose substrate. On average, the 1900-1 pilot system was
   able to treat 0.5 mg cyanide/l-h. The SBBR is a practical system for
   treating spent heap leachate in cold regions where a mobile, compact
   unit with minimal power I requirements is needed. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Laboratory columns were used to understand and predict bore clogging
   issues at a South Australian recycled water aquifer storage and recovery
   site, before held trials proceeded. The columns were used to study
   biogeochemical processes resulting from the continuous injection of
   recycled water into an aquifer matrix. The results showed that despite
   levels of suspended solids (SS) between 3-4 mg/l in the influent, flow
   rates (hydraulic conductivities) were maintained at 20-50\% of initial
   flow through three identical columns for a period of 22 days. An initial
   decline in the hydraulic conductivity (ii) through the columns was
   evident early in the experiment, and decreased from 0.78 m/day to 0.062
   m/day in the first 7 days of the experiment. This was thought to be due
   to physical clogging by suspended solids and then biological clogging by
   biomass accumulation and polysaccharide production at the inflow end of
   the columns. The physical bioclogging was relieved midway through the
   experiment due to calcite dissolution mainly at the inlet end of the
   columns. Calcite reprecipitation at the outflow end of the columns was
   evident from SEM micrographs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All tights

Abstract = {{Deterioration in the filter removal efficiency of submicron particles
   (lambda/lambda(0)) under unfavorable surface conditions is affected by
   the number of deposited particles per filter grain. In the case of above
   micron particles, the deterioration of filter removal efficiency has
   been mainly due to the blocking effect of deposited particles and not by
   the number of deposited particles. Deposition of large numbers of
   submicron particles changed the surface characteristics of collectors
   (filter grain associated with deposited particles) and enhanced
   unfavorable surface conditions. Filtration experiments were conducted
   with monodispersed suspensions of known sizes of submicron latex
   particles at different ionic strengths, using glass beads as filter
   grains. The filtration performance was predicted using a mathematical
   model assuming a linear relationship between lambda/lambda(0) and sigma
   (i.e, lambda/lambda(0) = 1-k sigma). For both particles, k was found to
   decrease and lambda(0) was found to increase with the increase in the
   ionic strength. Charge accumulation on the filter grain for deposition
   of submicron particles was calculated and was found significant at all
   the ionic strengths studied. For monodispersed suspensions of 0.816 mu m
   particles, charge accumulation was found to decrease with the increase
   in the ionic strength of the suspensions. A comparison was made on the
   relative importance of blocking effect and charge accumulation for the
   filtration of submicron particles. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Xiamen Harbour, in the;Xiamen Special Economic Zone of the People's
   Republic of China, was studied for its water and sediment quality, by
   determining the levels of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 12
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 18 organochlorine insecticides in
   water, suspended particulate matter (SPM)I pore water and sediment
   samples from nine stations in the Harbour. Total PAH concentrations
   varied from 106 to 945 ng/l in water, < I to 3548 ng/l in pore water.
   and 247 to 480 ng/g dry weight in surficial sediments. Total PCB levels
   varied from 0.1 to 1.7 ng/l in water, 2.7 to 34.8 ng/l in pore water,
   and <0.01 to 0.32 ng/g dry weight in sediments. The levels of all
   insecticides sere in the rang of 6.6-19.6 ng/l (water), 11.8-78.5 ng/l
   (pore water), and <0.01-0.58 ng/g dry weight (sediment). The levels of
   total hexachlorocyclohexane (HCHs) in sediments varied from <0.01 to
   0.14 ng/g dry weight, and those of total DDTs were in the range of
   <0.01-0.06 ng/g dry weight. The micropollutants were present in higher
   levels in pore water than in surface water, due possibly to higher
   concentrations of dissolved organic carbon or colloids with which the
   hydrophobic pollutants are strongly associated. Such a concentration
   gradient implies a potential Aux of pollutants From sediment pore water
   to overlying water. The levels of pollutants in sediments are one to
   several orders of magnitude lower than those found in 1993, suggesting
   their decreased inputs in recent years in the form of fresh and less
   contaminated material and possible degradation over a period of time.
   Further work is needed to quantify the levels of these contaminants in
   suspended particulate matter, which are currently below the limits of
   detection. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Indigenous bacteriophage was isolated from a conventional sewage
   treatment plant treating a largely domestic wastewater. The isolated
   phage was T-even-like with a mean size of 200 nm and was used to
   indicate the viral removal efficiency achieved in a bench-scale membrane
   bioreactor (MBR). The MBR incorporated three Bat microfiltration
   membrane modules which were polyethylene with a pore size of 0.4 mu m.
   When treating settled domestic sewage, the MBR achieved an overall
   removal rate of phage of 2.3-5.9 log across the treatment process. The
   membrane alone demonstrated a poor phage removal efficiency, but removal
   efficiency increased as the filtration resistance was increased. It was
   proposed therefore, that the biofilm accumulating on the surface of the
   membrane made a major contribution to phage removal. The MBR
   demonstrated an almost complete removal of faecal coliforms and faecal
   streptococci (up to 7 log). By comparison a full-scale treatment plant
   treating the same settled sewage and incorporating tertiary treatment,
   achieved only up to 2 log removal of the same excreted phage and
   bacteria. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Metabolism of enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) in an
   anaerobic/aerobic sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was investigated when
   glucose was supplied as, a sole carbon source. There have been several
   reports claiming that the EBPR could not be accomplished with glucose
   feed as a carbon source due to the dominating growth of so-called
   ``G-bacteria{''} which do not accumulate polyphosphate and take up
   glucose without ortho-phosphate release under anaerobic condition.
   However, in our work, high EBPR could be achieved even with the use of
   glucose as a sole carbon source following completely different
   mechanisms From previous reports.
   Glucose disappearance and glycogen accumulation rapidly occurred, which
   coincided with other reports. But the release of ortho-phosphate and
   synthesis of poly 3-hydoxy alkanoic acids (PHAs) were related to total
   organic carbon (TOC) concentration rather than glucose concentration.
   The fate of glucose in annerobic/aerobic stags H-as investigated by
   supplying all C-13-labelled glucose at the beginning of anaerobic stage
   which was traced by C-13-NMR spectroscopy. Results showed that the EBPR
   with glucose supply was accomplished at least by two kinds of microbial
   populations, a lactic acid producing organism (LPO) and a polyphosphate
   accumulating organism (PAO). During the anaerobic stage, about 0.42-C
   mmol of PHAs was synthesized from 1 C-mmol of glucose while 0.12 P-mmol
   of phosphate was released at pH 6.9. The amount of phosphate release was
   proportional to the FH value. The amount of PHAs synthesized was less
   than the amount of glucose added since glucose was converted to the
   other storage compound (inferred as lactic acid polymer) by the LPO in
   addition to the PHAs by PAO. During the aerobic phase, PHAs and storage
   compounds in cells were metabolized and phosphate uptake occurred. In
   this work, a probable metabolic pathway of PHA synthesis and phosphorus
   removal was proposed in a SBR supplied with glucose as a sole carbon
   source. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. hll rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tannery wastewater is a powerful pollutant. It can cause severe
   environmental problems related to its high chemical oxygen demand (COD)

   significant source of environmental contamination. Tannery effluent
   containing chromium (III) salts have to be treated to reduce the
   chromium concentration in the final works effluent to below the value
   specified in the discharge consent conditions. The objective of this
   study is to investigate the pretreatment of a tannery wastewater,
   typified by the mixed effluent from tannery operations. The behaviour of
   plain settling is described. The results demonstrate 41.5\% removal of
   total GOD, 83.2\% removal of chromium and 76.1\% removal of suspended
   solid after 3 h of plain settling. The sludge Volume was 28\% of the

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2177-2182}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Several million tons per year of water clarifier sludge are produced in
   Europe, with forecasts of the figure doubling by the next decade. End
   disposal of reference sludge is mainly based on controlled landfilling,
   after conditioning to minimise the volume of solids. The conditioning
   operation is carried-out in acidic or alkaline media, thus also allowing
   for coagulants recovery (AI, Fe species). The quality of the chemicals
   recovered may not be sufficient to justify their reuse, e.g., to water
   clarification operations.
   With the aim of improving the purity of coagulants recovered, a new ion
   exchange process for selective removal, separation and recovery of
   Al(III) and Fe(III) species from the clarifier sludge is presented. The
   IERAL (Ion Exchange Recovery of Aluminium) process is based on the use
   of a commercial weak electrolyte carboxylate resin (Purolite C106, from
   Purolite Co., UK), allowing for the removal of metals from the clarifier
   sludge acidic leachate (pH 3.5), followed by selective separation and
   recovery of the aluminium and ferric species during the resin
   regeneration step.
   Together with the performance of a fully automated 50 L/d pilot plant,
   this paper reports the basic principles of the process. (C) 2000

Volume = {{34}},

Pages = {{1419-1424}},

Abstract = {{Contrary to assumptions which have been current up to the present,
   juvenile daphnids of the species D. magna Straus exhibit a very varied
   sensitivity towards toxic chemicals between the ages of 0-24 h. During
   this period the greatest susceptibility towards potassium dichromate is
   reached between the ages of 22-24 h; younger daphnids are up to four
   times less sensitive. For this reason it is impossible to arrive at a
   reliable prognosis with potassium dichromate in defined concentration as
   reference substance using test groups of unknown age structure. However,
   positive controls for verifying correct testing procedure rely on
   comparable sensitivity amongst the test organisms and are essential for
   validating the test results. The range of 0.6-1.7 mg/l for the 24 h-EC50
   of potassium dichromate, which the ISO norm 6341 propagates as validity
   criterium; does not take sufficient account of the connection between
   dosage and effectiveness of this substance and thereby masks age related
   inequalities in the test animals. Therefore it cannot substitute the
   positive control which is missing in the lest specifications. As the
   toxicity of potassium dichromate is pH-dependent a specific carbonate
   hardness for the test medium should be determined. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Pages = {{1425-1434}},

Abstract = {{Organic al:id dissociation has usually been estimated from the
   difference between measured cations and anions (the anion deficit
   approach). An alternative is to use alkalinity titrations and an
   estimate of strong organic acids from TOC as an independent measure of
   organic acid dissociation (the CBALK approach). This approach may reduce
   the potential for errors relative to the anion deficit approach, which
   relies on summing up all measured constituents. Organic acid
   dissociation in a set of Swedish surface water samples from 700
   different lakes, as well as 200 samples from 11 streams was predicted
   using a triprotic analogue model with buffering characteristics similar
   to those of the widely used ``Oliver{''} model (OTM), but with a lower
   site density of organic acids. The average equilibrium pH of the samples
   in the weakly buffered pH range of 4.7-6.7 could be predicted more
   precisely (+/-0.16 FH units) using the CBALK approach, than when using
   the usual anion deficit approach (+/-0.41 pH units). The study supports
   the general applicability of models similar to the empirical OTM for
   predicting the dissociation of natural organic acids on a regional

Abstract = {{Nitrification of anaerobically pretreated municipal landfill leachate
   (270-1000 mg COD l(-1), 53-270 mg NH4-N l(-1)) was studied in
   laboratory-scale activated sludge reactors without (AS) and with (ASC)
   the addition of plastic carrier material. The reactors were run at 10
   degrees C (149 d), 7 degrees C (21 d) and 5 degrees C (16 d). With a
   loading rate of 0.027 g NH4-N g MLVSS-1 d(-1) and a hydraulic retention
   time of ca. 3 d, at 10 degrees C, complete nitrification was obtained in
   both reactors. At 7 degrees C, and in loading rate of 0.023 g NH4-N g
   MLVSS-1 d(-1), both reactors appeared to be overloaded and ammonium
   removal was only ca. 93\%. At 5 degrees C, with a lower loading rate of
   0.010 g NH4-N g MLVSS-1 d(-1), complete nitrification was obtained in
   the ASC reactor but in the AS reactor only 61\% of ammonium was removed.
   Aerobic posttreatment produced effluent with 150-500 mg COD l(-1), less
   than 7 mg BOD7 l(-1), and, on average, less than 13 mg NH4-N l(-1).
   In batch assays at 24 and 10 degrees C, maximum nitrification rates were
   0.13 and 0.03 g NO3-N g MLVSS-1 d(-1), respectively, while ammonium
   removal rates were twice as high. The nitrification rates were higher
   with than without carrier material, suggesting that a large fraction of
   nitrifying micro-organisms was attached on the surface of the carrier
   material.
   The results show that nitrification of anaerobically treated leachate is
   feasible at temperatures down to 5-10 degrees C. Benefits of the carrier
   reactor were evident only at low temperatures and under varying loading
   conditions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Control of pH during denitrification in subsurface sediment microcosms
   using encapsulated phosphate buffer}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Denitrification, a process in which nitrate (NO3-) is used as an
   electron acceptor during microbial respiration, often occurs in
   saturated sediment where oxygen has been depleted. During
   denitrification, pH may increase several units as nitrate is consumed
   and HCO3- and OH- are produced. A novel approach to control pH is the
   use of encapsulated buffers. Previous research has shown that KH2PO4
   microcapsules were effective at maintaining a neutral pH during
   denitrification in suspended bacterial cultures. Our objective was id
   test the ability of encapsulated buffers to control pH in subsurface
   sediment microcosms amended with NO3-. Sediment samples from three
   depths (37, 40, and 43 m) in the saturated zone beneath the Savannah
   River Site, near Aiken, SC, were amended with 1 mg NO3-/g. Nitrous oxide
   (N2O) production was measured by gas chromatography (GC) using the
   acetylene block technique. NO3-, ammonium (NH4+), total alkalinity, and
   sediment particle grain size also were measured as part of a nitrogen
   mass balance and to assess base neutralizing capacity. In two of the
   three samples, all of the NO3- added was converted to N2O at a rate
   between 0.7-2.3\% h(-1). pH levels above 8.0 were measured in vials to
   which no microcapsules had been added while the pH in vials containing
   microcapsules remained within 0.2 pH units of 7.0. The results indicated
   that over time periods as short as five days, denitrification increased
   the pH beyond the range considered to be optimal for microbial
   metabolism. Because these encapsulated buffers were effective at
   maintaining a neutral pH during denitrification in sediment microcosms,
   they may facilitate remediation of subsurface contaminants through the
   mediation of pH-limited biological or chemical processes. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The assumption that roof runoff can be considered as non-polluted
   stormwater that can be discharged directly into natural water bodies
   without impairing their quality and use was examined in a field study.
   Concentrations of major ions; total C, N, and P; heavy metals (Cu, Zn,
   Pb, Cd, Cr, Mn, Fe) and pesticides (triazines, acetamides, phenoxy
   acids) were measured in runoff from an inclined tile roof, an inclined
   polyester roof and a flat gravel roof. Runoff from the: first two roofs
   showed initially very high concentrations declining rapidly to lower
   constant levels. This first-flush effect was modelled using a
   first-order rate law (wash-off function). For most constituents,
   concentrations were in the range of the wet deposition after the first
   few mm runoff depth and total loads in the runoff corresponded
   approximately to the total (dry and wet) atmospheric deposition load.
   The flat gravel roof depicted a different behaviour. Rainwater was first
   retained before it overflowed. Consequently gravel will be weathered and
   most pollutants were partially retained in the gravel layer. However,
   corrosion of Cu in drains (rate about 5 g m(-2) y(-1)) produced such
   high Cu concentrations thai direct disposal of runoff is questionable.

Abstract = {{Natural samples of sea- and lake-surface microlayer and samples which
   have been previously extracted by organic solvent and then reconstructed
   on the water surface were studied by monolayer techniques and Brewster
   angle microscopy (BAM). Surface pressure-area (pi-A) and surface
   potential-area (Delta V-A) isotherms have been measured. Simultaneously
   BAM video images have been recorded. From pi-A isotherms, thermodynamic
   parameters describing the states of monolayers, namely compressional
   modulus C(s)(-1) and compressibility have been calculated.
   The pi-A isotherms of all three investigated microlayers (natural sample
   of sea-surface microlayer and ex-situ reconstructed film) were of
   expanded type without phase transition and the Delta V values are
   between 250-300 mV for the compressed films at 15 mN/m. However, a
   significant difference in morphology of the investigated microlayers was
   noticed. The BAM images depended on surface pressure. At lower surface
   pressures liquid condensed domains surrounded by liquid expanded phase
   were observed, and by compressing the domains become smaller and densely
   packed. This clearly indicates the presence of two phases showing that
   pi-A isotherms are insufficient for film characterization. BAM pictures
   of one of the studied samples showed conformational changes of domains
   during compression and expansion of surface layer. One of the samples
   showed homogeneous and continuous film without any defined structure in
   the whole area region. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A mathematical model was constructed which considers both biofilm and
   suspended biomass activity in relation to the biodegradation of
   individual chemicals in rivers, To calibrate this model for the
   surfactant LAS (linear alkylbenzene sulphonate), experimental data were
   obtained in a lab-scale artificial river system, which allowed to
   collect accurate and reproducible river biodegradation data next to the
   required river characteristics. Biofilm processes were shown to be by
   far the most significant removal mechanism of LAS in the considered
   system which had a high surface area to volume ratio. The biodegradation
   model could be fitted to the data using realistic parameter values.
   Subsequently, the model was corroborated by comparing its predictions to
   a field study in the Red Beck, a small Yorkshire river. Only easy to
   collect or default data were used as model parameters. The predicted LAS
   first-order removal rate coefficient (without any calibration using the
   field data) was 0.25 h(-1), which is less than 20\% slower than removal
   measured in the field. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Hydrotalcite and hydrotalcite-like compounds containing iron were
   synthesized. The effect of their physicochemical structure on the
   adsorption properties for humic substances were elucidated following the
   characterization of the compounds. The compounds and their heat-treated
   ones showed a high adsorption capacity for the humic substances
   dissolved in water. The following adsorption and/or removal mechanisms
   were suggested through the series of the studies. The removal of the
   humic substances occurs by both the intercalation of humic substances
   into the positively charged innerlayer (ion-exchange) and the adsorption
   onto hydroxyl groups of the compounds. The buffering pH function of the
   compounds enlarges the removal by producing hydroxides through their
   slight dissolution. The produced hydroxides coagulate the humic
   substances onto the compounds, resulting in a sludge with low water
   content. The additive salt increases the amount of adsorption. The
   compounds were found to be effective insoluble adsorbents for the
   removal of humic substances. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Conventional plating methods were used to quantify heterotrophic
   bacteria from a drinking water distribution system. Three media, plate
   count agar (PCA), R2A agar and sharp blood agar (TSA-SB) were used to
   determine heterotrophic plate count (HPC) levels. Grab samples were
   collected weekly. during the summer and autumn of 1997 at four locations
   in-a municipal water distribution system. The four sampling sites
   included the water treatment plant, a vertical standpipe, a booster pump
   station and a private residence along a dead-end mainline, Thr: pump
   station and private residence were also instrumented with water quality
   probes and on-line bioreactors. Relationships between levels of HPC
   bacteria and standard physical and chemical parameters were examined.
   HPC levels from R2A agar were found to be uncorrelated with HPC levels
   on TSA-SB agar at all four locations. Orange and yellow pigmented
   bacteria were the dominant expressions in all bulk fluid and biofilm
   samples. The fraction of pigmented bacteria in bulk fluid samples was
   greatest at the standpipe. Pigmentation percentages were found to be

Abstract = {{The role of the tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle and the:glyoxylate pathway in
   anaerobic accumulation of poly-beta-hydroxyalkanoates by enhanced
   biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) activated sludge was investigated.
   Accumulation of both poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and
   poly-beta-hydroxyvalerate (PHV) was observed, after feeding acetate to
   fresh activated sludge collected from a pilot-scale EBPR facility. Based
   on the supplied amount of carbon nutrient the level of PHA synthesis
   exceeded the level of expected synthesis. Feeding of pyruvate combined
   with acetate resulted in accumulation of PHB and PHV, in approximately a
   1:1 ratio. Citrate addition did not result in PHA accumulation but both
   PHB and PHV were formed when citrate combined with acetate was fed to
   the sludge. Succinate or succinate combined with acetate stimulated
   2-fold higher accumulation of PHV than PHB. In most cases of synthesis,
   total PHA accumulation exceeded total carbon input. This excess
   accumulation suggests the presence of nutrients that are normally
   unusable or cryptic in the absence of additional complementary nutrients
   such as short chain fatty acids. This hypothesis is consistent with the
   fragmentation patterns produced during gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometric (GC/MS) analyses of PHA extracted from sludge fed with
   C-13-labeled nutrients; Treating the EBPR sludge by adding different
   nutrients combined with malonate, alpha-ketoglutarate and
   monofluoroacetate, three common inhibitors of steps in the TCA cycle
   significantly impaired PHA accumulation and implied that these steps can
   be important for PHA synthesis. A biochemical model that incorporates
   elements of the TCA cycle and the glyoxylate pathway can account for the
   observed patterns of PHA accumulation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{To clarify the interaction between sulfidogens and methanogens in
   municipal anaerobic digesters, in situ substrate utilization by the two
   microbial groups was characterized by the accumulation rates of
   substrates after the addition of specific inhibitors, 20 mM of molybdate
   for sulfidogens and 0.01\% (v/v) of chloroform for methanogens in three
   anaerobic sludge digesters with different concentrations of sulfate (A,
   1.2; B, 1.8; C, 2.7 mM). The rates. of sulfate reduction and methane
   production in sludge C were the highest and the lowest, respectively
   among the three sludges. The major substrates for methanogens were
   acetate (35-58\%), and propionate (17-22\%) in all the sludges.
   Propionate should be utilized by methanogens after conversion to acetate
   and H(2) by syntrophic hydrogen-producing acetogens, as no methanogens
   are known to directly utilize propionate. Detectable accumulated
   substrates for sulfidogens (< 20\%) were propionate in sludges A and B
   and acetate in C. Still approximately 80\% of substrates for sulfidogens
   were unknown. These results show that acetate or propionate is a common
   substrate for sulfidogens and methanogens but sulfidogens can mainly
   grow on the other substrates in the municipal anaerobic sludges,
   implying nutritional segregation between sulfidogens and methanogens.

   ozonation of the natural water allowed reductions in THM formation.
   Characterization of the raw, ozonated and chlorinated water was made by
   concentrating the sample through liquid-liquid extraction, along with
   the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). A total of 66
   different organic compounds were identified, mainly carboxylic acids,

Title = {{A practical model for estimating total lead intake from drinking water}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1533-1542}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The main objective of this article is to present a new model that can be
   used to estimate the exposure of a population to lead contamination from
   the drinking water supply. The model is not to designed predict the
   particular situation in any one individual household, but tb provide an
   estimate of the average daily quantity of lead ingested by a consumer
   population from water quality and the characteristics of the household
   plumbing system. Data were gathered from field studies carried out over
   a one-week period. The sites selected were known to have differing risks
   of contamination due to lead piping. Water supplies were grouped into
   three classes (low, average and high risk of contamination) as a
   function of the water's lead dissolving capacity. The first class
   concerned water of low: alkalinity (3.4-6.6 degrees f) and high pH (>
   7.8), the second, water of: high alkalinity (20-25 degrees f) and
   moderate pH (7.3-7.8), and the third water of low alkalinity (6 degrees
   f) and pH dose to neutral (7.2). Lead concentrations measured in samples
   of water having stood in lead piping Showed that the rate of corrosion
   varied exponentially with time, being comparatively high at first. This
   may be related to the mass of lead released from the internal surface of
   the lead pipes. Measured levels fell into groups in accordance with the
   defined classes of water. Statistical techniques were used to calculate
   coefficients with the aim of characterising the time course of lead flux
   per unit surface area for each water class more precisely. In flowing
   water, surface flux at any instant principally depends on the alkalinity
   and pH of the water. However, the experimental data showed that the
   internal diameter of the pipe along with temperature are equally
   important factors. An estimate of the rate of lead dissolution from the
   pipe surface may be produced by statistical analysis of these four
   parameters. The daily volume of water used for cooking and drinking
   purposes at each site was estimated using specially designed
   ``proportional taps{''}. The sample of water drawn off, representing 5\%
   of total water consumption, was analysed and its lead concentration
   determined. The lead dissolved in this water stemmed partly from
   standing water and partly from flowing water. Further measures of lead
   concentration were taken to determine the degree of contamination
   occurring in standing and in flowing water. The comparison of these
   concentrations with the concentration found within the water sample
   drawn off gave the percentage of contamination to be attributed to the
   standing and flowing water fractions. The proportion of total water
   subject to stagnation was determined from the volume of the plumbing
   system. The data obtained were used to develop a model and a method for
   estimating lead contamination of cooking/drinking water and the related
   risk to the consumer. The proposed approach is based on the following
   simple observation. Most drinking water supply systems are composed of
   lead and nonlead piping. Thus, when water is run from a tap, the first
   fraction of water collected carries the highest lead concentration,
   since this water was standing in the lead pipes. The following water
   volume, held in the nonlead piping, will only be contaminated during its
   Row through the lead piping. The method involves two stages. Firstly,
   the pH and alkalinity of the water, as; well as the lead piping
   characteristics in the household plumbing system and the stagnation time
   are used to determine the lead concentration in standing and flowing
   water.
   Secondly, using the previously acquired knowledge of the daily
   consumption of cooking/drinking water for each household, a hydrogramme
   based on standard consumer behaviour can be established incorporating
   volumes of cooking/drinking water associated with stagnation rimes. By
   combining this information with contamination rates established in the
   first part of the study, the mean daily concentration of lead in the
   drinking/cooking water can be calculated. The quantity of lead ingested
   daily was calculated from a standard daily consumption of 31 divided up
   into three equal draw off volumes corresponding to stagnation periods of
   8, 3 and 5 h for the morning, midday and evening, respectively. In order
   to determine the respective concentrations of lead in water standing in
   and flow through the pipes, the relationships established in the first
   part of this study (relating to the unit area flow of lead during each
   of the two phases) were used. The mean daily concentration of lead in
   the cooking/drinking water was determined by combining these values,
   taking into account the proportion of water contaminated during each of
   the two phases. This value could be estimated by reference to the
   capacity of the lead pipe. In order to improve our knowledge of how
   different factors, such as water composition and piping characteristics,
   affect the mean lead concentration in water ingested by consumers, we
   carried out a computer simulation for lead pipes measuring 20 and 30 mm
   in diameter and 5 to 40 m long. For water classified as having a high
   risk of dissolution (pH 7.2 and alkalinity 5 degrees f), the simulation
   showed that the limit for lead concentration recommended by the WHO for
   drinking water (10 mu g l(-1)) is reached for five metres of lead
   piping.-Lengths of piping of this order are frequently encounted in old
   housing. For water at pH 8 and alkalinity 5 degrees f (the low risk
   class), the recommended limit is reached for pipes measuring 10 m and
   longer. An average concentration of 50 mu g l(-1) is reached for high
   risk waters (pH < 7.2. alkalinity 5 degrees f) only when pipe length was
   at least 40 m. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The waste slurry generated in fertilizer plants in India has been
   converted into a cheap carbonaceous adsorbent material. The practical
   applicability of this product has been investigated in the column
   operations and the mass transfer kinetic approach has been successfully
   used for the determination of various parameters necessary for designing
   a fixed bed adsorber. The value of breakthrough capacity is more than
   the batch capacity. The total time (t(x)) involved for the establishment
   of the primary adsorption zone (PAZ), the time (t(delta)) required for
   the movement of PAZ down its length, the fractional capacity (f), the
   length of (PAZ) primary adsorption zone (delta), and percentage
   saturation of column at break point have been evaluated for carbon
   columns for the removal of phenols viz., 2,4,6-trinitrophenol,
   4-nitrophenol, 4-chlorophenol and 1.3-dihydroxpbenzene. Studies have
   also been performed for the recovery of phenols and chemical
   regeneration of the spent column. It was observed that 70 mL of 5\% w/w
   NaOH or 50 mL of acetone are sufficient for almost complete desorption
   elf phenols. After regeneration with 1M HNO3 the sorption capacity of
   the column is almost the same as that of virgin adsorbent material. (C)

Abstract = {{In the trickling filter process, knowledge of the hydrodynamic behaviour
   is essential for accurate mechanistic modelling. Numerous measurements
   including the mean residence time, the free draining volume and the
   residence time distribution (RTD) have been performed in other studies.
   However, these results have often been obtained at pilot scale, and
   there is still a lack of data for the full-scale process. In the present
   work, eight full scale plastic-packed or stone-packed trickling filters
   receiving urban wastewater are studied. The free draining volume and the
   mean residence time obtained are used together with the literature data
   to find correlations. Despite the variety of operating conditions of the
   filters, correlations are established for the stone-packed filters as
   well as for the vertical and random plastic-packed filters. The RTDs
   were assessed from tracer experiments using injections of lithium
   chloride. In order to explain the observed RTDs, an hydrodynamic model
   is developed assuming that the tracer is transported by an axially
   dispersed plug flow and by diffusion in and out of the biomass. Model
   fitting permits to identify the volume of biomass and circulating liquid
   in the filter. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The in situ physiological activity of Microthrix parvicella in nutrient
   removal activated sludge systems was investigated by uptake of labeled
   substrates and subsequent determination by microautoradiography. M.
   parvicella had a considerable capacity to take up oleic acid under oxic,
   anoxic and anaerobic conditions. For the lipid trioleic acid, the: most
   pronounced uptake was found under anaerobic conditions, indicating that
   M. parvicella benefits from the degradation of lipids under these
   conditions. Starvation experiments with different electron accepters
   available showed that M. parvicella was able to maintain its high uptake
   capacity for 4, > 7 and 1-2 days under oxic, anoxic (with nitrate or
   nitrite present) and anaerobic conditions, respectively. This indicates
   that besides oxygen, also nitrate and nitrite could be used as electron
   acceptors. The limited tolerance to starvation under oxic condition
   indicates that highly oxic conditions were toxic for the organism. No
   autotrophic or mixotrophic growth on {[}C-14]hydrogencarbonate was
   detected, and the organism was not found to store {[}P-33]-labeled
   orthophosphate under alternating anaerobic and anoxic/oxic conditions
   applied for enhanced biological phosphate removal. Based on the
   information available on the physiology of A. parvicella, a hypothesis
   for the growth in nutrient removal plants was presented together with
   possible control measures. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   denitrification. The bypass flow ratio applied in this unit was 0, 0.3
   and 0.4 based on the influent flow rate. The removal efficiencies of
   COD, NH4+-N and T-P were observed to be higher than 87.2\%, 75.2\% and
   52.8\% in all runs, respectively. Further, the optimal operational
   conditions for phosphorus removal were estimated when the bypass flow
   ratio was 0.4 with the internal recycle ratio of 0.5 and the external
   recycle ratio of 0.5 on the basis of the influent flow rate. The removal
   efficiencies in the bypass flow ratio of 0.4 were 88.0\% for NH4+-N and
   68.0\% for T-P. Large differences in the removal of phosphorus resulted
   from varying the bypass flow ratio. With the bypass flow ratio of 0, 0.3
   and 0.3, the removal efficiencies for T-P were 52.8\%, 61.6\% and
   68.0\%, respectively. It is suggested that the bypass flow in the
   fixed-film reactor can achieve complete denitrification and can be
   helpful for improving phosphorus removal, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{This work experimentally examined the role of electrolyte and curing on
   freeze/thawed sludge dewaterability. We herein, for the first time,
   demonstrate that the presence of sludge particles have diminished the
   formation of salt/water eutectic, which is against the results in
   previous literature. The eutectic temperature of the electrolyte thereby
   had no effect on the sludge filterability and settleability.
   Furthermore, curing has profound effects on activated sludge
   performance, whose effect, however, is negligible for clay slurry. The
   mass transfer processes interpret the experimental results. Curing time
   alone is not a fundamental measure for the curing process. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Long-term data assembled for monitoring the water quality of the Thames
   estuary between 1977-1992 were used to examine the changing influences
   of physico-chemical variables on estuarine water quality during drought
   conditions. Seasonal and monthly means were computed and tested for
   significant differences. Time series data were used to estimate
   regression models explaining observed variations in water quality
   parameter measurements during the predrought (1977-1988) and drought
   (1989-1992) periods. Stability tests were used to establish significant
   differences in predrought and drought models and to make inferences
   about the significance of drought induced low flows on water quality.
   Significant mean seasonal and monthly differences were found for flow,
   chlorinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and suspended solids.
   Total oxidisable nitrogen showed no significant change. Regression
   analyses were consistent with these results and highlighted the
   significance of drought related changes in flow and temperature for the
   determination of estuarine water quality. This suggests that management
   policies designed to mitigate the effects of drought be extended to
   consider their effects on estuarine water duality given the ecological
   importance of these areas. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Wastewater from the manufacture of propellants typically contains
   2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), a known animal carcinogen. Previous studies
   have indicated that DNT is aerobically biodegradable. However,
   inconsistent removal of DNT during aerobic treatment has been observed
   at a munitions wastewater treatment plant, necessitating the use of
   activated carbon pretreatment. The objective of this study was to
   evaluate the effect of nutrient and cosubstrate amendments on the rate
   and extent of DNT removal. Addition of ethanol (100-500 mg/l) and
   phosphate (0.8-3.3 mg/l) significantly accelerated the rate of aerobic
   DNT (0.3-5.6 mg/l) biodegradation. Addition of phosphate alone also
   increased the rate of DNT degradation, bur to a lesser degree. The
   presence of ethyl ether, another substrate commonly found in munitions
   plant wastewater. had comparatively little affect on the, rate of DNT
   removal. Interruptions in the DNT manufacturing process can result in
   DNT being absent from the munitions plant wastewater for extended
   periods. The effect of such interruptions was evaluated in
   semicontinuously operated reactors, fed daily with phosphate-amended
   wastewater (containing no detectable background level of DNT), at a
   hydraulic residence time of 3 d. DNT was added at varying intervals
   (from once every 3 d to once every 15 d), DNT removal resumed without a
   lag even after it was absent from the feed for periods up to 15 d;
   During aerobic biodegradation of DNT, reduction to
   4-amino-2-nitrotoluene and 2-amino-4-nitrotoluene was consistently
   observed, with reduction at the para position predominating. The highest
   level of aminonitrotoluene formation was 23\% of the total DNT degraded.
   Aminonitrotoluene isomers were consumed within 1 d after the DNT
   disappeared in the semicontinuously operated reactors. confirming the
   potential for degradation of these metabolites. Although the
   aminonitrotoluene isomers are not currently regulated, their presence in
   treated munitions wastewater is a concern due to possible toxicity. (C)

Abstract = {{The concentration of retene, a di-alkyl substituted PAN derived
   microbially and thermally from dehydroabietic acid, eight resin acids
   and their derivatives were analysed from sedimenting particles collected
   from five lake sites receiving pulp and paper mill effluents and from
   two reference sites. At five of the sites, samples were collected prior
   and after a conventional aerated lagoon wastewater treatment system of
   the mill was modernized with an activated sludge plant, and elemental
   chlorine free bleaching (ECF) had replaced chlorine bleaching. The
   highest level of retene was 30.0-53.5 mu g/g dry weight (d.w.), observed
   3 km downstream from the mill. Nine kilometers downstream from the mill
   the concentration of retene was still 8.7-17.4 mu g/g d.w., distinctly
   exceeding that of the upstream reference (0.2-4.4 mu g/g d.w). The
   highest concentration of resin acids was 1474 mu g/g d.w., the most
   abundant resin acid bring dehydroabietic acid. The concentrations of
   retene and resin acids showed a distance related decrease downstream to
   a mill. The technology changes at the pulp and paper mill decreased both
   the sedimentation rate and the concentration of resin acids and retene
   in sedimenting particles. Presence of other resin derived neutral
   compounds (dehydroabietin, tetrahydroretene and fichtelite) in
   sedimenting particles was also revealed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Research into swimming pool water treatment has been conducted on both
   bench and pilot scales. Initial work made use of a recirculatory
   bench-scale rig containing about 45 l of water. A more recent study was
   based on a 2.2 m(3)-capacity pilot plant, a one-seventh linear scale
   model of an actual operational pool, incorporating conventional unit
   operations for swimming pool water treatment. The study is based on the
   use of a body fluid analogue (BFA), comprising the key dissolved organic
   and inorganic components of human perspiration and urine.
   Initial bench-scale trials indicated the analogue to be a reasonable
   representation of real body fluids in terms of levels of the key
   disinfection by-products (DBPs) of trihalomethanes (THMs) and
   chloramines (CAs) generated from conventional chemical disinfection by
   chlorination. Trials on the pilot-scale pool, on the other hand,
   indicated that: measured THM icl-els ware generally much lower than
   those recorded oil the bench scale, attaining equilibrium values after
   about 3 days of operation; chlorine demand, on the other hand, was about
   the same; for constant rate dosing of BFA the change in DBP levels on
   changing key operational determinants by +/-50\% vias shown to be
   significant only on increasing the: BFA dose rate (33\% increase in
   THMs) and decreasing the disinfectant dose (50\% decrease in THMs), the
   CA levels being largely unaffected throughout; dosing of BFA at a
   fluctuating rate (or intermittent) over a 14-h operating cycle produces
   higher levels of THMs than constant rate dosing at the same overall
   daily rate; the equilibrium ratio of chlorine arising in dissolved
   chloramines to that in dissolved THMs is around 42:1 a mass balance on
   the steady-state system can be carried out according to an assumption of
   either zero breakpointing or complete breakpointing to define the limits
   of DBP accumulation: the zero-breakpoint mass balance accounts for 38\%
   of the organic carbon, 61-63\% of the chlorine and 84- similar to 100\%
   of the ammoniacal and amino nitrogen, the exact figures bring very
   sensitive to assumptions made regarding trichloramine formation; the
   complete breakpoint analysis accounts for 52\% of the chlorine for 100\%
   oxidation of the ammoniacal and amino nitrogen, the organic carbon usage
   being unchanged at 38\%.
   It is surmised from the analyses undertaken that, even at the 100\%
   efficiency limits of Henry's law governed physical desorption or total
   breakpoint chlorination, 3 net accumulation of chlorine and
   carbon:arises. More rigorous analysis of both the pool water and the
   ventilated air would reveal the extent to which such an accumulation
   actually lakes place. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail rights

Abstract = {{The pretreatment of a model, polyethylene glycol-containing wastewater
   by wet air oxidation was studied in the context of integrated chemical
   and biological treatment processes. Both semibatch and continuous
   uncatalysed experiments were carried out at temperatures from 383 to 473
   K, residence times up to 60 min and an oxygen partial pressure of 2.8
   MPa. The concentration of total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen
   demand (COD) was followed throughout the reaction. Combined parameters
   and simple analytical techniques were used and provided a
   straightforward assessment of the chemical pretreatment efficiency with
   respect to partial oxidation and polymer degradation. It was found that
   at the conditions under consideration, partial oxidation dominates over
   total oxidation and is accompanied by substantial fragmentation of the
   original polymer to lower molecular weight compounds. Semibatch
   operation favours higher TOC and COD removal rates than continuous
   operation, while continuous operation generally favours higher partial
   oxidation efficiencies than semibatch operation. The benefits arising
   from the assessment of the extent of chemical pretreatment for the
   rational design of integrated treatment processes are also discussed.

Abstract = {{This study focused on the oxidation and subsequent polymerization and
   precipitation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) under the combined action of
   hydrogen peroxide and horseradish peroxidase (HRP); HRP was capable of
   catalyzing the oxidation and detoxification of 0.05 mmol PCP prepared in
   distilled/deionized water. The optimal pH for PCP transformation was in
   the rang 4-5. PCP reacted with peroxide with a stoichiometry of 2:1.
   Stoichiometric and chloride production studies indicate that the main
   products gene-related in the PCP treatment process are dimers. The
   residual toxicities of treated solutions were higher than could be
   accounted for by residual PCF. It was concluded that unidentified
   soluble products contribute to this excess toxicity. In contrast to
   previous studies of the treatment of various phenols, neither
   polyethylene glycol nor chitosan were effective in reducing HRP dose
   requirements nor in enhancing toxicity removal during PCP treatment. (C)

Abstract = {{Various titanates prepared by calcination of a mixture of KOH
   {[}Ba(OH)(2) or Ca(OH)(2)] and titanium dioxide slurry with a slightly
   crystallized structure were used as photocatalyst in the reaction of oil
   decomposition in water. The influence of both the calcination
   temperature and the kind of metal used on the photocatalytic activity of
   resulted titanates in the oil decomposition reaction in water have been
   studied. The phase composition of photocatalysts was determined by XRD
   technique. The correlation between the photocatalyst content, time of
   UV-illumination and the rate of oil decomposition were presented. The
   most active material was prepared fi om a slightly crystallized titania
   precursor and potassium hydroxide calcinated at 550 degrees C. The
   complete oil decomposition was achieved after 2 h of UV illumination
   with the photocatalyst content of 0.5 g dm(-3). The photocatalyst forms
   a complex mixture of various titanium oxides and titanates that are
   probably responsible for the increase of activity. For the most active
   TiO2/KOH photocatalyst the optimal preparation conditions were
   established. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The ratio of initial substrate concentration (S-o) to initial biomass
   concentration (X-o) is a key parameter of batch culture of activated
   sludge, and this ratio determines metabolic pathways of microorganisms
   iii batch culture. Based on a balanced dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   reaction, a kinetic model was developed to describe the dependence of
   the DOC distribution on the S-o/X-o ratio in substrate-sufficient batch
   culture of activated sludge. The proposed model was verified very well
   with both experimental data and theoretical analyses. It is clearly
   demonstrated that the final DOC distribution is governed by the S-o/X-o
   ratio, and a considerable portion of DOC is oxidized to carbon dioxide
   through energy uncoupling at higher S-o/X-o ratios. This study for the
   first time quantitatively shows the DOC partition between energy
   spilling-associated and growth-associated metabolisms at different
   S-o/X-o ratios. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Reactions between chlorine disinfectants, dissolved organic matter, and
   other chemicals in water form a series of disinfection by-products
   (DBPs), including trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs),
   that are toxic and subject to increasingly stringent regulations. This
   paper explores effects on DBP formation produced by an alternative,
   non-chlorine-based secondary disinfectant comprised of silver and
   hydrogen peroxide (Ag+/H2O2) that is designed to provide longlasting
   residual disinfection. Based on a series of laboratory experiments using
   simulated treatment and distribution systems, post-chlorination
   additions of the secondary disinfectant dramatically reduced the
   formation of halogenated DBPs. Five source waters were tested over a
   range of conditions, including various levels of chlorine dosing;
   bromine and organic carbon concentrations, pH and temperature. For
   surface and ground waters, DBP reductions at 24 h with the secondary
   disinfectant averaged 72 +/- 9\% for THMs and 67 +/- 11\% for HAAs after
   a 10-min chlorination period. The dramatic reduction in halogenated DBPs
   occurred for all tested source waters and all disinfection conditions.
   The likely mechanism is the reduction of chlorine to chloride by H2O2,
   which halts further reaction of chlorine with dissolved organic matter
   and other DBP precursors. Thus, H2O2 acts as a quenching agent, in
   addition to its residual disinfectant properties in combination with
   Ag+. This research shows a potential benefit of mixed disinfectants that
   provide a potentially viable option for controlling the formation of
   DBPs while maintaining effective disinfection. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{With sample volumes as tested in routine microbiological monitoring for
   the presence and absence of faecal indicator bacteria in treated water
   the actual concentration in the final stages of water treatment cannot
   be assessed. Consequently, no accurate information can be obtained about
   the removal efficiency of a water treatment for microorganisms.
   Therefore a method for on site isolation of faecal indicator bacteria
   from large volumes (1001 or more) of treated water using membrane
   filtration (MF-sampling) was developed and tested. The procedures for
   culturing the isolated microorganisms were similar to those applied in
   the routine methods for small volumes,using membrane filtration
   (mf-method). The recovery efficiency of MF-sampling for E. coli, S.
   faecalis and spores of sulphite-reducing clostridia ranged from 74.6 to
   100\% and only for E. coli a slight decrease with increasing sample
   volume was found. Field studies revealed that MF-sampling can easily be
   implemented in (routine) laboratory practice for an accurate
   determination of the concentration of faecal indicator bacteria in
   treated water after various treatment stages. From these data the
   treatment efficiency of the involved processes and the overall treatment
   for those microorganisms and the fluctuation in microorganism removal
   were determined. Such data can be used to improve water treatment
   regarding the removal of microorganisms. Validation of the use of faecal
   indicator bacteria asa surrogate parameter for the assessment of the
   effects of treatment processes on pathogenic microorganisms needs
   further investigation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Near-infrared spectrometry (NIR) is a rapid, inexpensive and
   reagent-free technique, widely used in industry in areas such as quality
   control and process management. The technique has great potential for
   environmental monitoring of aqueous systems. This study assesses
   relationships, using PLS regression, between NIR spectra of seston
   collected on glass fibre filters and the following measured lake water
   parameters: total organic carbon (TOC), total phosphorus (TP), Abs420
   and pH. Water samples were collected from 271 oligotrophic lakes during
   autumn 1995. The predictive model for TOC explained 68\% of the variance
   (SEP=2.1 mg L-1. range 14.9 mg L-1), and that for colour 71\% (SEP=0.04
   A, range 0.36 A), while the explained variances for pH and TP were 72\%
   (SEP=0.36, mu g L-1 range 3.13 mu g L-1) and 45\% (SEP =4 eta g L-1,
   range 41 mu g L-1), respectively. A model correlating NIR spectra and
   the actual amount of phosphorus in the seston captured on filters
   explained 86\% of the variance (SEP = 0.044 mu g/filter, range 0.47).
   Several pretreatments and regression techniques were used in an attempt
   to enhance modeling performance. However, straightforward PLS on raw
   data performed best in all cases. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The effects of sample storage on the assimilable organic carbon (AOC)
   bioassay using Pseudomonas fluorescens strain NOX have not been fully
   quantified to date, and in the current Standard Method, it is slated
   that samples can ``probably be held for several days{''} (Standard
   Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, ed. A. D. Eaten, L.
   S. Clesceri, A. E, Greenberg, 19th Edn., (1995)). Experiments were
   performed by splitting 22 samples after chlorine residual neutralization
   and pasteurization at 70 degrees C for 30 min, and holding one half of
   the replicate samples at 4 degrees C for one week prior to analysis. The
   majority of the samples were taken from a local water treatment plant
   and distribution system with source water from the deep Floridan
   aquifer. The others were taken from the laboratory tap water, whose
   source was also the Floridan aquifer. All collected samples were tested
   for effects due to storage, with each sample tested for AOC as soon as
   possible while an identical replicate was stored for one week. After one
   week, the AOC of the held samples was also determined. By comparing the
   AOC of samples that were not stored with samples that were stored, it
   was observed that after one week of storage, the AOC of the stored
   identical sample replicates increased by approximately 65\%. This was
   determined to result from BOM (biodegradable organic matter)
   fermentation to AOC by a yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans. OF the 22
   samples tested, only four displayed no significant change in AOC and
   none displayed a significant decrease in AOC. It was then determined
   that samples heat treated at 70 degrees C for 30 min could be stored for
   less than 2 days, but a modified pasteurization of 72 degrees C for 30
   min immediately followed by an ice bath for 30 min allowed storage for
   at least 7 days without significant changes in AOC. (C) 2000 Elsevier

   related to concentrations of suspended soil material, and increased with
   increasing discharge rate, but the slope of the curves obtained varied

Abstract = {{To study how microbial populations in activated sludge change over rime,
   an analysis of Aeromonas populations From a municipal activated sludge
   plant was carried out at two different periods: the first was
   characterized by low influent biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical

   Aeromonas strains were isolated on 10 mu g/l of C-glucose in starch
   glutamate ampicillin penicillin (SGAP-10C) medium and classified into 12
   DNA hybridization groups (DHG), using biochemical tests and numerical
   identification. Strains not differentiated by this method were
   ribotyped. Results revealed a difference in composition of Aeromonas
   DHGs: in the period characterized by high values of the parameters
   measured, the activated sludge displayed a wide diversity, whereas the
   period with low values showed reduced diversity and a modification df
   the dominant DHGs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the sludge retention time (SRT) between 3 and 15 days, on
   hydrolysis, acidification and methanogenesis of domestic sewage was
   researched by simulating a sludge bed segment of an upflow anaerobic
   sludge bed (UASB) system as a completely stirred rank reactor (CSTR).
   The CSTR systems were fed with primary sludge (settled solids of
   domestic sewage) as the influent at 25 degrees C, The study revealed
   that an SRT less than or equal to 8 days resulted in acidogenic
   conditions with negligible biogas production, whereas an SRT > 8 days
   resulted in methanogenic conditions. The hydrolysis of lipids and
   carbohydrates increased with increasing SRT, whereas protein hydrolysis
   only occurred under methanogenic conditions. Approximately 20 and 60\%
   of the particulate biopolymers are hydrolysed under acidogenic and
   methanogenic conditions, respectively. Hydrolysis was found to be the
   fate-limiting step for the conversion of carbohydrates. Under acidogenic
   conditions, acidification was the rate-limiting step for conversion of
   lipids, while both hydrolysis and acidification were limiting for the
   conversion of proteins. Under methanogenic conditions, hydrolysis was
   the rate-limiting step in the whole digestion process. None of the main
   components of primary sludge followed first order kinetics with respect
   to hydrolysis. The dewaterability of the sludges from the CSTRs operated
   under acidogenic conditions deteriorated, whereas the dewaterability of
   the methanogenic sludge improved in comparison with the dewaterability
   of the raw primary sludge. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Major environmental engineering programs are typically organized into a
   large number of individual projects grouped into one or more higher
   levels of classification. Managing such programs is challenging because
   of their sizes, long duration, diffuse activities, and vulnerability to
   change due to unforeseen conditions. Often, individual projects are
   canceled, delayed, or changed in scope, so that assessing the progress
   and efficiency of the overall program is not easy with conventional
   project-oriented software. In many cases current economic trends make
   raising additional revenues difficult, and regulatory agencies often set
   deadlines that are not likely to change, so that there is increasing
   pressure to control the costs and schedule of a program. Also, in many
   places important facilities are already years past their planned dales
   for repair or replacement, because of past neglect. This paper describes
   methods of aggregating, transforming, and displaying information about
   program progress that potentially have value for managers of a wide
   range of programs. These methods are demonstrated by a hypothetical
   example that contains simulated statistics for a major city wastewater
   system improvement program. The paper also considers some issues of data
   storage and communication between offices that would increase the
   convenience of performing such analyses and of other tasks of managing
   large programs. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Resin acids are a class of lipophilic extractives present in process
   waters of pulp and paper mills using softwoods as a furnish. These
   compounds cause pitch problems and adversely affect paper properties. As
   pulp;ind paper mills move toward water systems closure the concentration
   of these extractives are expected to increase. Therefore, it will become
   more important to monitor and control extractives content in the process
   lines of pulp and paper mills. Resin acids are traditionally analyzed by
   gas chromatography (GC). This method of analysis requires extracting the
   analytes from a sample matrix, separating by solid phase extraction and
   derivatizing the resin acids to increase their volatility. Although this
   process; is tedious and expensive and cannot be used as an on-line
   monitoring system, it does provide quantification of the individual
   resin acids with a low detection limit. Finding marker compounds for the
   total resin acid content of an in-mill process water sample may aid in
   the development of a fast and reliable monitoring system. A preliminary
   GC analysis of 25 in-mill process water samples established abietic acid
   as the best single marker for total resin acid content. A correlation of
   0.964 was found between the abietic acid concentration and the total
   resin acid content of these samples. This result led to the analysis of
   167 samples from a previous audit of resin acid content of in-mill
   process water samples. Abietic acid was the single best marker for these
   samples as well with a correlation of 0.928. An improved correlation of
   0.957 was obtained if a combination of isopimaric and abietic: acid
   contents was used as the marker for total resin acid content.
   Dehydroabietic acid, which has been shown to be a good marker for total
   resin, acid content of mill effluent samples, was al poor marker for
   in-mill samples. A correlation of only 0.664 was obtained between DHA
   and total resin acid content of the samples analyzed. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Aggregation and sedimentation of particles in lakes, estuaries, settling
   basins and the deep ocean play a central role in biological cycles, fate
   and movement of contaminants, and trace element transport. Relative
   quiescence with continuous influx characterizes these and other aqueous
   environments. However, our understanding of the processes of aggregation
   and sedimentation in these vital systems is poor. Inadequate
   experimental systems and measuring instrumentation are primary causes of
   this shortcoming. This paper details a laboratory experimental system
   which creates a continuous flow, quiescent microcosm in which particle
   aggregation and settling can be studied. The system's functioning and
   quiescence has been rigorously verified and the conditions for
   successful operation defined. A model is detailed which describes fluid
   and solute movement in the experimental system. The results of the
   system verification studies indicate significant fluid mixing may occur
   in experimental systems which are assumed to be quiescent, yet where no
   careful temperature management has been employed. This unexpected and
   uncontrolled fluid motion may lead to significant errors in experiments
   whenever particles smaller than about 20 microns with environmentally
   relevant densities are studied. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The term water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) was defined as the entire
   pool of water soluble organic carbon tither sorbed on soil or sediment
   particles or dissolved in interstitial pore water. The potential of soil
   and sediment for providing DOC to natural waters depends on the content
   and the sorption coefficient of the WSOC. A procedure of multiple
   solid-water ratios was proposed for simultaneous determination of the
   content and the sorption coefficient of the WSOC. The method was applied
   to several soil and sediment samples collected from the Yichun River
   Basin, China. The content and the sorption coefficient of the WSOC in a
   wetland soil and the A horizon of an upland soil were found to be higher
   than those in the AB horizon of the upland soil and: a river bottom
   sediment. Both parameters correlate positively with the humic substances
   content of the samples. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of air flow rate on oxygen transfer efficiency was examined
   in clean water and under process conditions in an oxidation ditch
   equipped with fine bubble membrane diffusers and large blade slow speed
   mixers. Under process conditions, an increase in the air flow rate
   resulted in a decrease of the oxygen transfer efficiency similar to that
   observed in clean water. Consequently, the value of the alpha factor was
   in the order of 0.58 independently of the air flow rate (between 45 and
   110 m(3) h(-1) per m(2) of membrane). The combined influence of the air
   how rate and of the horizontal liquid velocity on the oxygen transfer
   efficiency was studied. Results have evidenced that regrouping the
   diffuser grids and applying a horizontal flow could lead to a
   significant limitation in the impact of the air flow rate on the oxygen
   transfer efficiency. Finally, the use of the off gas method to determine
   the oxygen transfer efficiency of an aeration system at a given air flow
   rate led to the definition of a relationship, that enabled the
   evaluation of the system oxygenation capacities at air flow rates
   different from the one at which the measurements were initially
   performed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In a sequencing biofilm batch reactor (SBBR) wastewater is treated by
   bacteria growing on support media packed in the reactor body. In
   addition, the packing serves as filter media to minimize the
   concentration of suspended solids in the effluent. Mathematical
   simulation studies and tracer experiments at lab-scale and
   semi-full-scale reactors were conducted to investigate the hydraulic
   retention time distribution Function and flow patterns under various
   hydraulic loading rates. Results obtained reveal that introduction of a
   new batch of wastewater and withdrawal of the purified water can be
   executed at the same time without running the risk of polluting the
   effluent of the reactor with not yet treated wastewater. At a volumetric
   exchange rare of 68\% in the lab-scale SBBR and 90\% in the
   semi-full-scale system, respectively, the front of the tracer remained
   well underneath the effluent weir. Application of the fill/displacement
   strategy allows reduction of the cycle time and enhanced exploitation of
   the reactor volume. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All-rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of both biological bulking and foaming in activated-sludge
   plants in Italy was carried out from January 1996 to July 1998. Of 167
   plants surveyed, 84 had a foaming problem, 81 had a bulking problem, and
   55 were affected by both during the sampling period. Bacterial
   identification revealed that Microthrix parvicella was the most common
   filamentous microorganism involved in bulking and foaming. Other
   filamentous microorganisms such as the Eikelboom types 0041, 021N, 0092,
   0675, Thiothrix, and nocardioform actinomycetes (GALOs), were also
   detected at lower frequencies. An increase in the size of the
   filamentous population resulted in a deterioration of the settling
   properties of the biomass with loss of sludge through the final
   effluent. Our survey indicates that the use of the contact zone
   technique or the addition of chemicals such as oxidants and coagulants
   are promising approaches for solving bulking and foaming problems. (C)

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to investigate the characteristics of
   pollutants overflow on storm events, relationships between pollutant
   load and runoff, and the first flush effect in urban areas. Nine
   watersheds in the cities of Taejon and Chongju, Korea were selected for
   sampling and study with different characteristics during the period from
   June 1995 to November 1997. Runoff and quality parameters such as BOD5,
   GOD, SS, TKN, NO3-N, PO4-P, TP, Pb, Fe, and n-Hexane extracts were
   analyzed for the development of relationships between runoff and water
   quality. From the hydrograph and pollutograph analysis, the peak of
   pollutant concentration preceded that of the flowrate in an area smaller
   than 100 ha in which impervious area occupied more than 80\%. The peak
   of pollutant concentration, however, was followed by that of flowrate in
   the watershed in an area larger than 100 ha in which the impervious area
   was less than 50\%. This phenomenon appeared to occur more frequently in
   the watershed which has the combined sewer systems. In the storm event,
   the relative magnitude of the pollutants unit loading rate was in the
   following order; high density residential > low density residential >
   industrial > undeveloped watershed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Both gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) and Ames test results
   were used to study the Al(2)(SO(4))(3) and FeCl(3) coagulation and
   sedimentation effluents in a pilot plant. Based upon the molecular
   structure of fulvic acid:and the mechanism of organics coagulation, the
   authors propose a mechanism for fulvic acid adsorbing mutagenic organics
   in water. When the coagulant is fed into water, the metal ions will
   combine with fulvic acid to form complexes, this releases the organics
   and mutagen which are adsorbed and complexed by fulvic acid and results
   in an increase of mutagenic activity in the effluent. In addition,
   according to the principle of fulvic acid to generate free radicals and
   the chemistry of Fe(3 +), the authors discuss the impact of two
   coagulants on the generation of mutagenic activity. It is indicated that
   Fe(3 +) catalysing the reaction for fulvic acid to produce free radicals
   is the reason that the mutagenic activity in FeCl(3) coagulation and
   sedimentation effluent is higher than in Al(2)(SO(4))(3) effluent. (C)

Abstract = {{The potential of the Fenton's reagent for oxidation of p-aminophenols,
   which are the main developers used in white and black processes, was
   assessed. Metol {[}N-methyl-p-aminophenol] was chosen as a model.
   Degradation of this compound by Fenton's reagent was examined under dark
   conditions as a function of reagent concentrations and pH used in batch
   treatments. Under optimal conditions, 0.2 M H2O2, 9.0 x 10(-4) M Fe2 +,
   pH 3-5 and room temperature, the initial COD of a 5 x 10(-3) M metol
   solution was reduced by about 50\% within 2 h. After this time,
   additional COD reduction was very slow (about 20\% in five days). No
   aromatic compounds were detected about 4 h of reaction indicating that
   residual organic matter was mainly made up of ring cleavage products.
   Metol conversion behaved as a first-order reaction with respect to metol
   and Fe2 +. Complete destruction of residual organic matter could be
   achieved at high temperatures (about 60 degrees C) or by using the
   photo-Fenton reaction, which thus opens up prospects for an effective
   treatment of p-aminophenols in effluents from photographic processes.

Abstract = {{Due to the nascent wastewater treatment practice in Mexico there is
   great opportunity to introduce anaerobic digestion as the core of the
   wastewater treatment processes. Nevertheless, this requires an
   understanding of all the technical, economical and financial aspects
   that limit its development. According to the National Water Commission,
   in 1995 municipal and industrial wastewater were produced at rates of
   232 and 168 m(3) s(-1) respectively, but only 20 and 12\% of these
   volumes were treated, often with very low efficiencies. In order to
   increase the treatment capacity of the country, approximately US\$ 4515
   million managed by the banks for development are supposed to be
   available to invest in environmental projects. Other financing
   mechanisms exist through treasury incentives and penalties. Within this
   situation, anaerobic digestion has grown although not at the required
   rate and bigger investments are being made on conventional aerobic and
   physicochemical technologies. Presently there are in the country 85
   anaerobic wastewater treatment plants treating 216,295 m(3) d(-1) with
   an installed volume of 228,551 m(3). UASB reactors account for 74\% of
   the installed volume and national companies have supplied 76\% to the
   anaerobic market. Proper integration of the anaerobic digestion
   processes for water recycling and energy recovery has not been achieved
   and there is a big need to demonstrate economic and ecological
   sustainability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A large mine has been in operation in Italy for over 70 years producing
   chrysotile, whose residual rock was disposed of at two different sites
   near the mine. This report refers to a hydrogeological survey on the
   surface water and the ground water located downstream of the mine. The
   study has been supported by the Turin Municipal Waterworks Company, to
   reveal the presence of asbestos fibres in its distribution network or in
   the raw water of different supplies, wells and rivers. The analytic
   method consists in Vacuum filtering of water samples, observation with
   Scanning Electron Microscope of the particles and analysis with
   microprobe. After 12 months of monitoring, asbestos pollution has been
   revealed both in ground water and in surface water, likely due to both
   anthropic pollution of the mine and natural presence of asbestos fibres
   in the rocks of the acquifers and in the river-bed. In any case, the
   absence of asbestos fibres in water provided to consumers shows that the
   potabilisation method is able to retain this mineral from raw water. (C)

Abstract = {{In a preliminary biomonitoring study, accumulated trace metal
   concentrations (Cu, Zn, Fe, Cd, Pb, Mn, Ni) have been measured in the

   sites in May 1998, and from one site in each of January and February
   1998. Barnacles were collected simultaneously from four of the five
   sites in May 1998. Analysis of covariance has shown significant
   geographical and temporal differences in the local bioavailabilities of
   trace metals to mussels and barnacles, as reflected in the
   concentrations of accumulated trace metals. It is concluded that the
   mussel and barnacle are suitable biomonitors to employ in programmes
   designed to assess changes in metal pollution in the Gulf of Gdansk, one
   of the most metal polluted parts of the Baltic Sea; due to the outflow

Abstract = {{We describe a generalized version of the BOD decay model in which the
   reaction is allowed to assume an order other than one. This is
   accomplished by making the exponent on BOD concentration a free
   parameter to be determined by the data. This ``mixed-order{''} model may
   be a more appropriate representation of the aggregation of underlying
   processes that contribute to overall oxygen consumption in organic
   wastes and therefore has the potential to result in improved model fit.
   In order to directly compare the relative plausibility of alternative
   choices for a reaction order, we adopt a Bayesian approach to parameter
   estimation. This approach uses Bayes' theorem to develop a joint
   probability distribution for all parameter values conditional on the
   observed data. From this joint distribution, we employ a numerical
   integration method to derive marginal parameter distributions that can
   be used to directly compare the relative plausibility of competing
   parameter values. For the data sets we examine, reaction orders other
   than one are generally much better supported by the data, and the
   often-proposed second-order model does not appear to be an adequate
   alternative. For practical use, the mixed-order model formulation
   results in a better fit to observations and yields more realistic
   predictions of ultimate BOD than the first-order expression. In
   addition, the probabilistic nature of the Bayesian model we describe
   facilitates explicit consideration of uncertainty in subsequent water
   quality management and decision-making. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The reduction of azo dyes by zero-valent iron metal (Fe-0) at pH 7.0 in
   10 mM HEPES buffer was studied in aqueous, anaerobic batch systems.
   Orange II was reduced by cleavage of the azo linkage, as evidenced by
   the production of sulfanilic acid (a substituted aniline). Adsorption of
   the dyes on iron particles was less than 4\% of the initial
   concentration, and > 90\% mass balance was achieved by summing aqueous
   concentrations of dye and product amine. All of the 9 azo dyes tested
   were reduced with first-order kinetics. The kinetics of decolorization
   at the lambda(max) of each dye were rapid: a typical k(obs) was 0.35 +/-
   0.01 min(-1) for Orange II at 130 rpm on an orbital shaker,
   corresponding to a surface area normalized rate constant (k(SA)) of 0.21
   +/- 0.01 L m(-2) min(-1). The rate of reduction of Crocein Orange G
   varied with initial dye concentration in a way that suggests saturation
   of surface sites on the Fe-0, and varied with the square-root of mixing
   rate (rpm) in a manner indicative of mass transfer limited kinetics.
   Correlation analysis using k(obs) for all of the azo dyes, estimates of
   their diffusion coefficients, and calculated energies of their lowest
   unoccupied molecular orbitals (E-LUMO), gave no strong trends that could
   be used to derive structure-activity relationships. Using an authentic
   sample of wastewater from a dye manufacturing operation and
   construction-grade granular Fe-0, rapid decolorization was achieved that
   was consistent with reduction of azo dyes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Following a high rise in nitrate levels in St Lawrence mesocosm of the
   Montreal Biodome in 1995, inputs, outputs and changes in N pools were
   independently measured to estimate the N budget of the system. The
   resulting budget had only an 8\% difference between the inputs (CV =
   11.1\%) and the sum of the outputs and changes in N pools (CV = 9.6\%).
   N inputs amounted to 342 kg for 1995; 58\% was contributed by the food
   for fish and invertebrates and 35\% by the seabird guano. Filtration and
   general cleaning removed 20\% of the inputs. The pool vacuum cleaner
   designed by the Biodome staff proved to be an important addition to the
   system since it increased by 30\% the efficacy of the life support
   systems (LSS) at removing N, and removed detritus glued to surfaces or
   trapped in sediments that could not be removed by the LSS; 65\% of N
   accumulated in mesocosm mainly as NO3 (92\%), but also as fish and
   invertebrate biomass (8\%). Assuming 21 mM as the maximum NO3
   concentration for survival of the animals on display, the N budget
   showed that, without integrated dissimilation or assimilation processes,
   marine aquaria similar in design and operation to the SLM must be opened
   after 5-7 years of operation unless N inputs can be reduced or N outputs
   increased. As suggested by the budget, the removal of one seabird
   species (gannets) and an increase in partial water changes (from 9 to
   16\% per year) in 1996 have, since then, stabilized the level of NO3 to
   12-13 mM. The N budget was effective in identifying the role of each
   component in the system, suggesting changes in the operating practices,
   and predicting the impact of these changes. It is a useful water quality
   management tool for artificial environments, such as closed aquatic
   mesocosms. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A kinetic model for mixed weak acid/base systems is described. In the
   model, the weak acid/ base equilibria have been formulated in terms of
   the kinetics of the forward and reverse reactions for the dissociation
   of the weak acid/bases. The compound H (+) is explicitly included and pH
   is calculated from the H (+) concentration via pH = -log(H (+))= -log
   f(m){[}H (+)]. For the conditions considered, the weak acid/ bases
   included are the water, carbonate, ammonium, phosphate and short-chain
   fatty acids systems. However, the modelling approach is completely
   general and can be applied to include any other weak acid/base of
   importance. Ion pairing, precipitation of calcium carbonate and carbon
   dioxide gas exchange also are included. The model was validated by
   comparing model predictions with those obtained from conventional
   equilibrium chemistry based algorithms. A very good correlation was
   obtained. Compared to the equilibrium approach, the kinetic approach
   offers several advantages in that it facilitates seamless integration of
   (i) precipitation, gas stripping and dissolution kinetics of minerals
   and gases within the mixed weak acid/base chemistry structure and (ii)
   the biological kinetic models for wastewater treatment systems to extend
   application of these models to situations where the pH is not constant.

Abstract = {{A three phase (aqueous/solid/gas) mixed weak acid/base kinetic model is
   developed to simulate the physical and chemical processes that occur on
   aeration of anaerobic digester supernatant. Included in the model are
   the kinetic reactions for (i) weak acid/base dissociations (water,
   carbonate, ammonium, phosphate, and short-chain fatty acids), (ii)
   precipitation of struvite, newberyite. amorphous calcium phosphate,
   calcium and magnesium carbonate and (iii) stripping of CO2 and NH3
   gasses. A preliminary validation of the model is done using data
   available in the literature. The model was then applied to simulate
   batch aeration tests on two anaerobic digester supernatants from (i) a
   spent wine upflow anaerobic sludge bed digester and (ii) a sewage sludge
   anaerobic digester. In the batch tests pH, Ca, Mg, PO4-P, free and
   saline ammonia (FSA) and H2CO3{*} Alkalinity (from which inorganic
   carbon is calculated) were measured. After establishing (i) the minerals
   most likely to precipitate viz. struvite (MgNH4PO4), newberyite
   (MgHPO4), amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), CaCO3 and MgCO3 and trial
   and error determination of (ii) the solubility products, (iii) specific
   precipitation rate constants and (iv) the specific gas stripping rates,
   a good correlation was obtained for all the parameters for both
   supernatants. The solubility product values for the minerals that
   precipitated were the same in both supernatants, and fall in the range
   of values quoted in the literature but the specific precipitation rate
   constants of the minerals were different in the two supernatants.
   Compared to the equilibrium chemistry approach to modelling three phase
   mixed weak acid/base systems, the kinetic approach facilitates (i)
   integration of the weak acid/base model with biological kinetic models
   and (II) determination of solubility products and precipitation rates in
   an integrated manner for a number of minerals simultaneously from a
   single batch test. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals were chosen according to human
   consumption and occurrence in the aquatic environment like sewage plant
   effluents, rivers and groundwater to investigate their behavior during
   oxidative water treatment. Derived from data compilation in literature
   the lipid lowering agent clofibric acid and the analgesic agents
   ibuprofen and diclofenac were selected. Analyses of the acidic compounds
   were carried out after solid-phase extraction and online derivatization
   in the GC injector by means of single ion monitoring (SIM) GC/MS.
   Oxidation experiments with the aim to degrade the pharmaceuticals were
   carried out in bench scale using ozone and ozone/hydrogen peroxide
   (advanced oxidation process). Under the specific reaction conditions
   only diclofenac was degraded by ozone to about 3\% of its initial
   concentration. The combined application of ozone and hydrogen peroxide
   leading to OH-radical formation improved the degradation efficiency of
   all investigated compounds. The application of increased oxidant
   concentration resulted in a better degradation of all compounds to more
   than 90\% at a concentration of 3.7 mg l(-1) ozone and 1.4 mg l(-1)
   hydrogen peroxide and to more than 98\% at a concentration of 5.0 mg
   l(-1) ozone and 1.8 mg l(-1) hydrogen peroxide. At the applied
   conditions no reaction products could be detected by GC/MS analyses
   after derivatization of acidic functional groups. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A correlation between the turbulence generated in a channel flocculator
   and the efficiency of flocculation is presented. Two test units were
   used, a horizontal flow flocculator of 85 channels, 47 mm wide, in
   series totalling 102 m in length which was adjustable in longitudinal
   slope and into which different grid-type baffle arrangements were
   inserted and a clear-sided channel for the measurement of flow velocity
   and turbulence levels using laser-Doppler anemometry (LDA). For
   flocculation a synthetic river water was coagulated with aluminium
   sulphate and efficiency assessed by turbidity change after 30 min
   settling. Conclusions reached were that a flocculator retention time of
   15-20 min is adequate with G x t of 25,000-35,000 and a longitudinal bed
   slope of 1 in 48. Sixty percent of G x t should occur in the first half
   of the system with the time between turbulence surges to be around 8-10
   s induced either by a channel bend or by inserting baffle(s) in the
   first third or so of the flocculator. Derived head loss coefficients are
   3.2 for a channel bend and 6 for a grid baffle with effective
   obstruction of the flow area of up to 45\%. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Constructed wetlands have emerged as a viable option for addressing a
   wide range of:water quality problems, especially in treating wastewater
   effluent. This paper presents longitudinal profiles in disserved organic
   carbon (DOC) concentrations and structural characteristics across a
   full-scale wastewater treatment wetland receiving lagoon-treated
   wastewater (DOC = 15-25 mg/L). DOC removal through the wetland varied
   seasonally, achieving a maximum net removal of 47\% in February and
   minimum net removal of 9\% in June. During summer months, when the
   wetland plants were actively growing, DOC decreased across the first
   half of the wetland and then increased through the second half of the
   wetland. Specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm always increased
   across the wetland, with the largest increases (> 130\%) occurring
   during summer months. DOC lability decreased across the wetland. DOC
   reactivity to form trihalomethanes was also reduced on both an absolute
   and per carbon mass basis. Laboratory experiments employing a series of
   wetland microcosms with HRTs ranging from 1.6 to 7.4 days were employed
   to determine the amount of DOC leached from Typha wetland plant
   material. During fifty-six day steady-slate experiments, roughly 5-8\%
   of the total Typha biomass added was leached as DOG, 45-60\% remained in
   the reactor as accumulated biomass, the remainder of the carbon
   (30-50\%) exited as particulate organic carbon or was microbially
   respired. We hypothesized that DOC in the wastewater effluent
   biodegraded over the first-half of the wetland, and that DOC leaching
   from plant material occurred throughout the wetland. A DOG-wetland model
   was developed, and the results suggested that the percentage of
   plant-derived DOC increases with longer HRTs, and while the overall DOC
   concentration exiting a wetland may only be slightly lower than influent
   levels that a majority of the DOG, which contains a large percentage of
   refractory DOG, could be plant-derived. Wetlands with short HRTs would
   reduce the amount of DOC leached from plant material. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Previously, critical load maps for UK surface freshwaters have been
   created by applying the steady state water chemistry model to a spot
   sample of water from a lake, from each 10 km square. If no lake is
   present, as was the case for many squares in the north east of Scotland,
   a sample from a river thought likely to be most sensitive to
   acidification was used. This study evaluates the effectiveness of this
   approach for protecting all the waters of the complex river network of a
   major catchment in N.E. Scotland, under high and low Row regimes.
   Samples were collected and analysed over a period of one year, at
   intervals of two weeks, from 59 sub-catchments of the River Dee
   catchment. Critical load values were calculated for every sample, and
   also using mean annual concentrations of Na (+)(,) Ca2 + Mg-2 (+), K (+)
   and Cl-. In addition, to investigate discharge effects, they also were
   calculated for each site for base and high flows, using stream water
   chemistry corresponding to the three lowest and the three highest
   discharge levels respectively. Only two rivers were insufficiently
   protected under base flow conditions, whereas 20 apparently were not
   sufficiently protected under high Row conditions. It is concluded that
   the system used in the UK is generally very effective for protection of
   rivers, but only under low flow conditions. More work is needed to
   assess the biological impacts of episodic critical load exceedance in
   upland rivers. A more recently suggested approach for classifying UK
   river water sensitivity to acidification from the Na (+) dominance of
   the solute base cations in water samples is also shown to be effective
   for this river system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Ballast water tanks in ships are today often corrosion-protected by
   sacrificial zinc anodes in addition to protective coating. Dissolved
   zinc has been found to be toxic to early life stages of many freshwater
   and marine organisms. We have therefore examined if the zinc released

   aquatic biota. When assuming a simplistic model for the release of zinc
   from the anodes, the zinc concentrations in ballast water could reach
   from 1.16 mg/l at pH 8.2 to 29 mg/l at pH 7.5. The former corresponds
   roughly to one, and the latter corresponds to two orders of magnitude
   times the levels found to kill or injure early life stages of various
   aquatic organisms. The use of zinc anodes in corrosion protection may
   thus have possible negative impacts on the biota in enclosed harbour
   waters, but can reduce the numbers of nonindigenous aquatic organisms

Abstract = {{Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in the use of natural and
   constructed wetlands in the remediation of a variety of wastewaters.
   Despite the widely recognised importance of sanitary indicator bacteria
   as fundamental measures of water quality, surprisingly little work has
   been conducted on the behaviour of enteric bacteria, and other
   microorganisms, in macrophyte systems. This paper reports the findings
   of an investigation of faecal coliform (FC) and faecal streptococci (FS)
   removal in four small, parallel Typha-dominated, surface flow reed beds,
   constituting the tertiary phase of treatment at the Crow Edge sewage
   treatment works near Holmfirth in Yorkshire. Samples were collected at
   the inflow and outflow points of each bed, twice-weekly for 10 weeks
   between June and September 1998. On average, an order of magnitude
   reduction in concentration was observed between inflow and outflow
   wastewater for both indicator bacteria, giving mean bed removal
   efficiency values of approximately 85-94\%. However, FC concentration in
   the final effluent was still several thousand CFUs/100ml on most
   sampling occasions. Moreover, bacterial removal efficiency was strongly,
   negatively correlated with the flow rate of effluent through the system
   and, at times of high flow, beds were often relatively inefficient in
   removing both indicator organisms. Overall, the relative performance of
   the beds was similar, but some significant differences were found.
   Reasons for these findings are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Assessment of Giardia viability is a major requirement for public health
   purveyors and the water industry. Several indicators of viability such
   as stains, excystation and animal infectivity have been used to
   enumerate cysts with varying degrees of success. A combined
   detection-viability method for use in water samples would be useful for
   detecting and determining the viability of cysts in raw and drinking
   waters and the efficacy of disinfection at treatment plants. Distilled
   water samples were seeded with purified Giardia cysts and incubated with
   fluorescein diacetate (FDA) initially to stain viable cysts followed by
   tetramethyl red labelled anti-Giardia monoclonal antibodies (TMR) for
   confirmation of identity. As a result of FDA staining, green
   fluorescence of intact viable cysts was observed microscopically using a
   450-490 nm exciter filter while nonviable cysts were not stained.
   Giardia cysts reacted positively with TMR and glowed red using a triple
   band microscope filter with excitations of 400/450/570 nm. Al this
   wavelength a combination of FDA and TMR stained viable cysts green
   internally with a red wall while nonviable cysts only stained red. This
   simple, reliable and quick method allowed differentiation of Giardia
   cysts in water samples while simultaneously determining their viability.

Abstract = {{Densities of fixed bacterial biomass were measured on different pipe

   sources (ground waters and a surface water) which had different
   characteristics (temperature, concentration of residual oxidant and
   content of biodegradable organic matter). Results showed that the
   densities of bacterial biomass fixed on plastic-based materials (PE and
   PVC) were the lowest. Densities of bacterial biomass fixed on gray iron
   were from 10 to 45 times higher than those measured on plastic-based
   materials. Cement-based materials had intermediate values. Pairs of
   cement and PVC coupons were incubated at 15 different locations in a
   distribution system, and there was a strong correlation between the
   amount of fixed bacterial biomass on these coupons, with the cement
   containing 2.6 times more biomass. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The interaction of Cu, Zn and Ni ions with blast-furnace slag has been

   established that the sorption of metal ions is accompanied by the
   partial solubilisation and hydrolysis of the calcium silicates and
   aluminosilicates of the slag. The sorption is due to various processes:
   ion-exchange and replacement of calcium ions from the slag by the metal
   ions in the solutions as chemical bonding of hydrolysis metal species
   with the surface. The physicochemical investigations on blast-furnace
   samples differing in phase composition show that the presence of
   well-crystallised phases increases the sorption activity. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{This study aimed to evaluate the continuous flow centrifuge (CF
   centrifuge) for recovering Cryptosporidium oocysts from water under
   realistic environmental conditions. This was achieved by taking 100 l
   samples from a water tank with known seeding and turbidity levels.
   Samples were concentrated and purified using percoll discontinuous
   gradients and stained using monoclonal antibody on polycarbonate
   membrane filters. The maximum percent recoveries were achieved at a flow
   rate of 0.75 l/min and centrifuge speed of 2900 x g. When compared
   directly with cartridge filtration at a seeding level of 10 oocysts/l
   and low turbidity of 1 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU), recoveries
   were 14.8 and 9.7\% (n = 3) for the CF centrifuge and cartridge
   filtration respectively. At a higher turbidity of 5 NTU, recoveries were
   13.0 and 9.0\% respectively. These differences were not significant but
   the CF centrifuge sample is faster, simpler and safer to process. Its
   integration into flow cytometry is also evaluated. The recovery of Gini
   dia by CF centrifugation at 10 cysts/l and 5 NTU gave a mean recovery of
   37.9\%. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Activated sludge is a complex mixture of inert suspended solids. various
   microorganisms, and extracellular material. Research on the physical
   characteristics of activated sludge is complicated because the living
   microorganisms continuously change sludge characteristics, making it
   almost impossible to carry out controlled experiments or reproduce test
   results. Therefore, in dewatering, settling and conditioning studies of
   activated sludge, there is a clear need for an activated sludge
   surrogate that is chemically well defined, stable, and successfully
   represents activated sludge properties. One such chemical surrogate,
   named ``synthetic sludge{''}, suggested by Sanin and Vesilind {[}Sanin,
   F. D. and Vesilind, P. A. (1996) Synthetic sludge: a physical/chemical
   model in understanding bioflocculation. Water Environ. Res. 68 (2),

   calcium ions. In this sludge the polystyrene latex particles simulate
   individual bacteria, and alginate simulates extracellular material tied
   into a matrix with the calcium. However, one important component,
   something to simulate the filamentous microorganisms, is missing. The
   lack of filaments in the synthetic sludge causes the flocs to be weaker
   and smaller than activated sludge flocs,
   In this study synthetic sludge is improved by adding cellulose fibers to
   simulate the filamentous microorganisms found in activated sludge. The
   addition of cellulose results in the formation of strong flocs,
   improving the dewaterability and settleability of synthetic sludge. (C)

Abstract = {{Changes in dissolved oxygen (DO) cycling patterns in natural surface
   waters have been shown to be useful as a potential indicator of
   biodegradable: organic pollution. The effect has been demonstrated by
   dosing a water body with 2.5 and 5.0 mg l(-1) TOC, added as pot-ale, and
   monitoring the DO values continuously for 96 h. These loadings were
   added to water columns (in tubes) suspended from a raft in a small lake
   in North East Scotland. The addition of organic pollution burden to the
   lake water produced two effects. The mean DO value was lowered
   initially, but increased as organic loading was consumed. Secondly, the
   amplitude of the DO cycle increased as organic loading increased from
   2.5 to 5.0 mg l(-1) TOC. From the results of a DO dynamic model
   developed in this project, and from the lake raft experiments, it can be
   concluded that dissolved oxygen cycles may be useful as an indicator of
   biodegradable organic pollution load. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Ring-billed gull populations of eastern North America have grown
   dramatically in the past 30 years. To assess the possible impact of
   these populations on recreational waters, gull droppings collected at
   three colonies were examined for fecal coliforms, Aeromonas spp.,
   Campylobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp. and
   Staphylococcus aureus. The samples were also analyzed for Shigella spp.
   and Yeusinia spp. The samples were collected every two weeks from late
   April to mid-July. The measured concentrations were compared on the
   basis of colony, age class and sampling date by analysis of variance
   (ANOVA) and Fisher's LSD multiple range test. In general, there was
   little difference in bacterial content as a function of age groups,
   colony or sampling date. On the basis of the documented ratios between
   the various pathogens and total coliforms in the droppings, the limit of
   200 fecal coliforms per 100 mi of water used for recreational water
   quality in Canada provides an acceptable level of protection with
   respect to contamination by gulls. However, we must qualify these
   findings by stating that they reflect the situation that existed at the
   time of sampling, that they apply to a small number of pathogenic
   microorganisms, and that they do not take into account soil or sand
   contamination at beaches. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The role of humic substances in general and hydrophobicity of humic
   substances in particular on membrane permeate flux is unclear. The main
   goal of the present study is to evaluate the effect of fractionated
   humic substances on ultrafiltration (UF) performance. A commercial humic
   solution was subjected to a hydrophobic resin for fractionation of the
   hydrophobic and hydrophilic fraction. These fractions were further
   fractionated into different molecular wight groups, using gel filtration
   chromatography. The hydrophobic fraction accounts for 85\% organic
   carbon recovered and has a significantly high THM (trihalomethane)
   formation potential. or 190 mu g/mg C. The hydrophilic fraction exhibits
   the worst flux decline despite little solute rejection. The results of
   molecular weight fractionation of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic
   fractions further indicate that those molecules with the largest
   molecular weight (6.5-22.6 kDa) exhibit the worst Aux decline. The UF
   system evaluated is unable to remove a significant portion of THM
   precursors, resulting in potentially high THMs in the permeate. The use
   of powdered activated carbon (PAC) for the pretreatment of
   hydrophobic/hydrophilic humic substances or in an integrated PAC-UF
   system exhibits an enhanced membrane fouling. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The irregular occurrence of high rates of nitrification (nitrification
   events) in the upper waters of a nitrogen polluted urban lake, Onondaga
   Lake. NY, during the fall mixing period is documented. The analysis is
   supported by eight years (1988-1995) of measurements of total ammonia
   (T-NH3) and oxidized forms of N (NOx) in the lake and its inflows, and
   dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature profiles. A tested system-specific
   mass balance model for N is used to estimate nitrification rates for
   these years, and a system-specific DO model is applied to demonstrate
   the impact of a nitrification event on the lake's oxygen resources for a
   single year. Rates of nitrification for different years ranged from near
   zero throughout the fall mixing interval (1994) to an average of about
   0.18 d(-1) for one month (1995). The nitrification events cause major
   interannual variations observed in the pools of T-NH3 and NOx in the
   lake's upper waters in fall, and are probably responsible for the
   particularly severe lake-wide depletion of DO observed in certain years
   during this interval. Nitrification was the dominant loss process for
   T-NH3 and source for NOx in years that the events occurred. The
   exacerbating effect of the events on the oxygen resources of the lake
   needs to be accommodated in related remediation efforts. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The rate of photodegradation of the Fungicide fenarimol
   (alpha-(2-chlorophenyl)-alpha-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-pyrimidine-methanol) by
   solar radiation has been studied in natural waters with different
   salinities. Photodegradation rates and quantum yields are found to
   decrease with increasing salinity.
   To explain this behaviour, experiments were pei formed with different
   salt solutions (NaCl, NaBr, BaCl2 and ZnCl2) using both solar
   irradiation and a photoreactor (lambda(excit) 313 nm). As with natural
   waters, marked effects of added salt were observed on the photolysis
   rater which decreased significantly from 0.67 h(-1) in the absence of
   salt to 0.11 h(-1) in the presence of BaCl2. In photoreactor studies,
   the observed order of quenching was BaCl2 > ZnCl2 and NaBr > NaCl. In
   contrast, neither the triplet state quencher sorbic acid nor oxygen had
   any effect on the photolysis, supporting the idea that photodegradation
   goes by the lowest excited singlet state of fenarimol.
   To understand the origin of the effect of added salts, fluorescence
   quenching studies have been performed with various halide and nonhalide
   salts and the respective quenching constants determined. With NaCl and
   NaBr, the ratio of fluorescence quenching constants is identical to the
   ratio of reciprocal quantum yields for photodegradation of fenarimol,
   indicating a common mechanism. The correlation of fluorescence quenching
   rates with halide ion oxidation potentials strongly suggests that this
   involves an electron transfer mechanism. It is suggested that the effect
   may be used to stabilise the fungicide towards photodegradation. (C)

Abstract = {{The metabolic response of a mixed population to stepwise increase in
   phenol concentration was followed with the assay of pyrocatechase
   activity. The mixed population was grown in a laboratory scale activated
   sludge plant for 40 days. The inlet phenol concentration (750 mg l(-1))
   was then increased stepwise to 1250, 2500 and 4500 mg l(-1),
   corresponding to low, moderate and high level increases in phenol
   loading, respectively. Pre- and post-shock assessments were performed on
   samples collected from the aeration tank. Pyrocatechase activity
   increased following each step increase in phenol and the level of
   increase was dependent on the magnitude of the step increase. Following
   low level increase in loading, phenol was not detected from the aeration
   rank. At moderate level loading phenol was temporarily detected in the
   aeration rank but disappeared after 7 days. At high level loading phenol
   was accumulated in the aeration tank throughout. Pyrocatechase activity
   was dependent on the concentration of phenol in the aeration tank. From
   pyrocatechase activity assay it was possible to demonstrate the
   metabolic response of the activated sludge to changes in phenol
   concentration. The accumulation of phenol and decrease in pyrocatechase
   activity are considered as the stage when the system no longer copes
   with increase in phenol loading. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Following lack of investment in wastewater treatment, high investment
   and maintenance cost, conventional treatment systems have not been used
   in Tanzania, On the other hand, cost effective wastewater treatment
   methods like the use of septic tanks, soak pits, drainage fields and
   waste stabilization ponds are widely applied. One of the methods of
   achieving compliance using conventional treatment systems at low cost,
   producing treated water pollution free and fostering a community
   responsibility for wastewater treatment involves the use of natural or
   constructed wetlands. To date, no wetlands have been used for treating
   wastewater in Tanzania. Therefore in an attempt to promote the use of
   constructed wetland for wastewater treatment, a horizontal Row
   constructed wetland at the University of Dar es Salaam was commissioned
   for treatment of wastewater effluent from the University waste
   stabilization ponds (WSP).
   This paper presents results obtained from a constructed wetland (CW)
   installed at an outlet of the WSP of the University of Dar es Salaam.
   The field tests were conducted at low and high filtration rates 0.27 m/h
   and 2.3 m/h respectively for a period of 4 weeks. Treatment
   effectiveness was evaluated which indicated high mean removal
   efficiencies; 80\% for SS, 66\% for GOD, 91\% for faecal coliforms (FC)
   and 90\% for total coliforms (TC) achieved at the low filtration rate.
   Thus, wetlands if properly designed, operated and maintained can provide
   an efficient and economical means of upgrading the quality of secondary
   treated wastewater to an acceptable level. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Neural network procedures were used to predict the metal (Cu, Zn and Cd)
   solubilization percentages in municipal sludge treated with a continuous
   process using Thiobacillus ferrooxidans. The neural networks consider
   several hydraulic retention times and FeSO4. 7H(2)O concentrations in
   addition to pH, oxydo-reduction potential and initial metal
   concentrations as input variables. The resulting neural network showed
   adequate prediction of metal solubilization percentages with mean
   absolute deviations varying from 5 to 8\% and good flexibility to
   predict solubilization percentages of observations that are not used in
   the training of the network (test set). A second neural network showed
   the ability to predict solubilization percentages for an hydraulic
   retention time different from those used in the building of the network
   keeping the mean absolute deviations at 5 to 8\%. Furthermore, a simple
   graphical analysis of neural network results allowed us to bring out
   several important relations between metal solubilization and hydraulic
   retention time or iron sulfate concentrations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Pyrene of natural and anthropogenic sources is one of the toxic,
   mutagenic polycyclic-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) listed as priority
   pollutants. This study focuses on an integrated approach for the
   degradation of pyrene involving chemical oxidation followed by
   biological treatment. The objectives were to: (1) provide mechanistic
   details in the degradation of pyrene subject to ozone treatment, (2)
   test the combined technique of ozone pretreatment followed by biological
   degradation; and (3) test a pretreatment column to promote efficient use
   of chemical oxidants and biodegradability. Batch and packed column
   reactors were used to examine the degradation pathways of pyrene subject
   to ozonation in the aqueous phase. After different ozonation times,
   samples containing reaction intermediates and byproducts from both
   reactors were collected. identified for organic contents, and further
   biologically inoculated to determine biodegradability. The
   O-3-pretreated samples were incubated for 5, 10, 15, and 20 days, after
   which BOD, GOD, and toxicity tests along with qualitative and
   quantitative GC/FID and GC/MS analyses of pyrene, intermediates. and
   products were performed. Intermediates identified at different stages
   included 4,5-phenanthrenedialdehyde, 2,2',6,6'-biphenyltetraaldehyde,
   and long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons, which suggested that the
   degradation of pyrene was initiated by O-3 via ring cleavage at the 4,5-
   and 9,10-bonds and that further oxidation ensued via reactions with both
   O-3 and OH. until complete mineralization. Intermediates formed during
   chemical oxidation were biodegradable with a measured first-order rate
   constant (k(0)) of 0.24 day(-1). The integrated chemical-biological
   system appears to be feasible for treating recalcitrant compounds, and a
   chemical pretreatment column is particularly useful in promoting soluble
   intermediates from otherwise highly insoluble, inaccessible pyrene. (C)

Abstract = {{The production of microbial aerosols by urban sewage treatment plants
   may have wide hygienic implications which call for careful evaluation:
   exposure to such aerosols may in fact represent a health hazard for
   plant workers and nearby residents alike. This paper describes the
   results of a study analysing the degree of microbial contamination at
   different levels of treatment at several plants in the City of Leghorn
   (Livorno, Italy). Monthly aerosol samples were collected with an agar
   impact sampler from January to November 1996, from different sites at an
   activated sludge plant, an anaerobic sludge plant and a wastewater
   washing station. The total bacterial and coliform counts were
   determined, and pathogenic enteric bacteria and viruses were determined.
   These same parameters were also measured in wastewater and sludge
   samples obtained at the same sites. The results revealed that high-grade
   airborne contamination existed at several of the studied sites. In
   particular, pathogenic enteric bacteria (Salmonella enteritidis and S.
   boydii) were isolated in 2\% of the samples (540 l per sample), reovirus
   in 46\% and enterovirus in 9\% (1800 litres per sample in indoor
   environment and 3000 l outdoor), always in association with the former
   virus. The biological parameters measured had no evident correlation
   with meteorological factors such as temperature, relative humidity or
   wind characteristics. Viral contamination proved to be quite wide-spread
   and detectable even in the presence of low levels of bacterial
   contamination. Although virological analysis have been only qualitative,
   and the different volumes examined for viruses and bacteria cannot allow
   us to appraise with accuracy the association between these two
   parameters, the viral presence along with low bacteria contamination
   suggests more dedicated studies to address with greater accuracy the
   quantitative aspects of this association. However the monitoring
   performed allowed for a determination of the areas of greatest potential
   risk for plant workers, and the preventive measures most suitable to
   guaranteeing their safety. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A comparative field and laboratory study was conducted on the
   infiltration of combined sewer overflow (CSO), with the infiltration of
   tertiary municipal wastewater (TMW) studied in parallel. Compared to TMW
   quality, CSO exhibits elevated concentrations of dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC, 34 +/- 11 mg l(-1)), and nutrients (N, 24 +/- 10 mg l(-1);
   P, 1.8+/- 0.5 mg l(-1)), while the adsorable organohalogen load (AOX) is
   significantly lower (23 +/- 10 mu g l(-1)). During infiltration the DOC
   and AOX of CSO are biologically eliminated by 70 and 17\%, respectively.
   Considering these parameters, groundwater quality under CSO infiltration
   is comparable to or better than under TMW infiltration, while nitrogen
   and phosphorous concentrations remain elevated. Site specific effects
   were observed in the field, such as desorption of nutrients and AOX,
   which were accumulated in the soil during wastewater infiltration over
   one century. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A river sediment was treated to obtain different oxic conditions. and
   the phosphorus status investigated by experiments in which KH2PO4 was
   added to suspensions in calcium chloride. The pH, redox and solution
   composition of dissolved Ca, Mg, Fe, Na, K, Mn, Cl and SO4 and soluble
   reactive phosphorus were measured at the end of 24 h mixing. The
   equilibrium phosphate concentration was calculated from these
   measurements using the linear, Freundlich and dual-site Langmuir
   isotherm equations. The chemical speciation of the solutions was
   evaluated using PHREEQC and a model designed specifically for phosphorus
   speciation. These were used to estimate the solution saturations with
   respect to various iron and calcium containing minerals. The results
   show that at least a two-fold increase in the calculated equilibrium
   phosphate concentration of the sediment occurs with a moderate change in
   the electron activity from 8 to 4 as the sediments became reducing.
   Chemical precipitation and dissolution reactions were also found to be
   important during the experiments, with dissolved iron concentrations in
   oxic conditions determined by equilibration with amorphous iron
   hydroxide. Only in the suspensions with the highest soluble reactive
   phosphorus concentration was the solubility limit of ferric phosphate
   approached. There was also evidence for the loss of calcium from the
   solutions and oversaturation with respect to octacalcium phosphate.
   Vivianite, found in the sediment, was also expected to dissolve in the
   most oxic conditions. It is proposed that ancillary measurements of pH,
   redox potential, dissolved Ca, Fe, Mn and alkalinity during equilibrium
   phosphate concentration determinations will provide a better
   understanding to the buffering reactions controlling phosphorus in
   solutions in contact with sediments. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Contamination of coastal aquifers by seawater is either due to the
   excess amount of pumping above their safe yield capacity or due to local
   causes like overpumping near the shores (even without the excess amount
   of pumping at the scale of the whole aquifer) or both. This problem is
   faced frequently if these aquifers are mainly in use for irrigation. The
   amount of water that is utilised continuously within the aquifer is
   calculated through volumetric (3-D) approaches of both the water balance
   and the salt balance equations where the space and time components are
   integrated. This inverse methodology is used for the determination of
   poorly known terms in rime and space. The variation of contours showing
   the water table levels and concentrations of NaCl have been drawn for
   the last 20 years. The unknown component of the water balance equation.
   that is the extraction of water from the aquifer by the South, is
   calculated as 8.5 MCM/year. Then the average amount of water that is
   pumped above the safe yield capacity, thus causing the depletion of the
   saturated volume of the aquifer, is estimated as 17.4 MCM/year. The
   total amount of remaining freshwater available within the aquifer is
   found to be 1565 MCM; hence, the remaining lifetime of the aquifer is
   expected to bt:no more than 90 years. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This work is focused on the use of nutrients from dairy wastewaters as
   fertilizers. studying the optimum operational conditions for the
   bio-mineralization of the: nitrogen organic matter. Wastewaters from
   1500 to 2500 mg COD/l and at alkaline pH of between 8.5-12 were studied,
   in an aerobic biological treatment at a bench scale. The temperature was
   maintained at 30 degrees C. In some experiments, the COD was reduced at
   the same time as nitrification. An increase of the organic load produced
   a delay in the appearance of the ammonium, though the concentrations
   reached were greater than with lower loads. The phosphate profiles was
   parallel to that of ammonium. However. the ammonium becomes exhausted as
   a consequence of the release of ammonium, as ammonia, to the atmosphere
   and of consumption by the microorganisms, whose: metabolic requirements
   for ammonium are greater that those for phosphate. The experiments with
   an initial COD of 1500 mg/l and pH of 10.5 completed nitrification
   within the 30-day test period. The maximum concentrations of ammonium
   were reached when the initial pH was 8.5. On the other hand, the highest
   rates of protein hydrolysis were recorded at initial pH of 10.5 and 11.0
   units. Part of the nitrogen present in milk was lost as ammonia when the
   initial pH was 11.5 and 12.0. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1225-1232}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Density currents exist in most activated sludge secondary clarifiers,
   but the causes are controversial. The purpose of this study was
   investigation of the internal Row regimes to identify and evaluate the
   principal causes of density currents in secondary clarifiers. This study
   was part of a project focused on controlling the impact of density
   currents on the performance of activated sludge secondary clarifiers.
   A 1:25 scale model of a conceptualized prototype rectangular clarifier
   was used and was operated by the Froude model law. Experiments were
   conducted in the laboratory with tap water and in the field with
   activated sludge mixed liquor. Two inlet baffle, intermediate baffle and
   effluent weir configurations and three sludge draw-off configurations
   were used in the experiments. In all cases, one-half of the influent Row
   was removed through the sludge draw-off ports located in the tank
   bottom. In each experiment, velocity pattern observations and
   temperature measurements were made throughout the tank.
   Observed flow patterns were very similar in the laboratory experiments
   with tap water and the field experiments with mixed liquor.
   Temperature-driven density currents formed quickly under ail inlet
   baffle and outlet configurations and were extremely stable. Depth of the
   density currents was inversely related to the difference between
   temperatures of the influent and tank contents. A temperature difference
   as small as 0.2 degrees C resulted in formation of density currents.
   Moreover, the formation of a density current in the tank was independent
   of the amount of suspended solids in the entering suspension.
   Temperature appears to be the primary cause of density currents in
   secondary clarifiers and the type of density current, surface or bottom,
   will depend on whether the influent is warmer or cooler than the tank
   contents. In the field, due to the difference between the air and
   influent mixed liquor temperature, the formation of density currents in
   secondary clarifiers appears to be inevitable and little affected by the
   presence or type of inlet or intermediate baffles. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a new respirometric method is proposed. in order to
   estimate readily biodegradable GOD, slowly biodegradable GOD, and the
   active heterotrophic biomass present in a wastewater; necessary for
   modelling and upgrading the biological treatment processes.
   As the initial conditions of the batch procedures proposed need to be
   adapted to each sewage under study, the presented method is based on the
   combination of two experiments. at high and low So/Xo ratio (initial
   ratio between wastewater and biomass in gCOD/gVSS). The first ones are
   obtained by direct aeration of wastewater without sludge addition, and
   the second by mixing wastewater sample with an excess aerated sludge
   volume. at low So/Xo, in the range 0.01-0.2 gCOD/gVSS. The use of a
   biological model and an identification procedure allows simultaneous
   estimations to be made of the kinetic parameters and the initial
   concentrations in COD biodegradable fractions, and of the active
   heterotrophic biomass.
   Firstly, assuming that the yield coefficient is known (Y-H), the
   structural identifiability of the COD fractions is proved. Then it is
   shown that the combination of two experiments with the same sample
   allows the readily biodegradable COD concentration to be clearly
   identified, and greatly improves the estimation of the hydrolysable
   fraction of COD, dividing by three the standard deviation of the
   results. The determination of heterotrophic biomass concentration is
   obtained from the same respirograms, but need a simplified
   interpretation for some experiments. Concerning the French sewage
   studied (12 samples), the concentration of heterotrophic biomass
   measured in (around ?3\% of total GOD) is high compared with classical
   data. The same wastewater contains a readily biodegradable COD
   concentration varying from 6 to 14\% of total GOD, and a hydrolysable
   fraction in the range 41-66\%. These results are compared with those
   obtained by the classical flow-through method and good agreement is
   shown between the two procedures. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Nitrification in lakes and rivers is usually modeled using first-order
   water column kinetics. Over the years, a number of scientists have,
   however, recognized the importance of sediment nitrification, especially
   in shallow systems. The aim of this study is to determine the extent of
   nitrification in the water column and sediments of a eutrophic system
   and to propose simple kinetic equations to describe the process. An
   intensive experimental study was performed (summer and fall 1992, fall
   1993) on Onondaga Lake and the adjoining Seneca River, a hypereutrophic
   system with high ammonia concentrations (2-10 mgN l(-1)). Water samples
   and sediment cores were collected and laboratory nitrification studies
   performed. The results clearly demonstrate that there is rapid
   nitrification in the sediments of both Onondaga Lake (0.37 gN m(-2)
   d(-1)) and the Seneca River (0.32 gN m(-2) d(-1)). In contrast, no
   apparent nitrification was observed in the water column of the lake or
   river, despite high ammonia concentrations. The findings of the Most
   Probable Number (MPN) test provide a likely reason for this phenomenon,
   showing that the lack of nitrification in the water column is probably
   due to low nitrifier densities (similar to 10(1) cells ml(-1)), whereas
   the rate is rapid in the sediments due to high nitrifier populations
   (similar to 10(5) cells ml(-1)). It is therefore believed that
   nitrification in this relatively deep system is localized to the
   sediments and simple zero order kinetics is proposed as a first approach
   to model the process. It also stimulates the question of whether
   nitrification in most freshwater systems is principally a sediment
   process and should be modeled accordingly. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Effects of silicate, sulfate, and carbonate on the removal of arsenite
   {[}As(III)] and arsenate {[}As(V)] by coprecipitation with ferric
   chloride were studied. Silicate significantly decreased As(III) removal
   when Si concentration was higher than 1 mg/l and the pH was greater than
   5. The removal of As(V) was decreased moderately by silicate in 0.04 M
   KNO3 solution. Addition of Ca2+ and Mg2+ to the KNO3 solution reduced
   the adverse affect of silicate on As(V) removal. In the presence of 10
   mg/l Si and at a pH of approximately 6.8, the adsorption capacity of
   ferric hydroxide for As(V) and As(III) was reduced from 864 and 116 mu
   g/mg to 274 and 23 mu g/mg Fe, respectively. Sulfate and carbonate had a
   negligible effect on the removal of As(III) and As(V). The triple layer
   model was used with site binding reactions to describe As(III) and As(V)
   removal by ferric hydroxide in the presence of silicate. The results
   obtained in the present study suggest that silicate in natural water can
   significantly decrease the efficiency of As(III) removal by coagulation
   treatment with ferric chloride. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Zinc is an ecotoxic metal commonly associated with discharges from
   abandoned mines. Previous difficulties in removing zinc from
   circum-neutral mine waters with anaerobic wetlands have led to the
   development of a novel method to remove zinc from some mine waters of
   the North Pennine Orefield, UK. Geochemical modelling indicates that
   zinc carbonate (smithsonite. ZnCO3) should precipitate from these mine
   waters if pH can be raised from the ambient value of 7.5 to 8.2. It was
   postulated that this could be achieved through closed-system reaction
   with calcite, in a simple gravity-flow, sealed bed of limestone gravel
   (an ``anoxic limestone drain{''} (ALD)). Previous applications of ALD
   technology have been for strongly acidic mine waters, with the intention
   of achieving wholesale alkalinity generation. In this new application,
   the ALD is meant to achieve a marginal increase-in pH to encourage
   removal of zinc from the water by smithsonite precipitation. Testing of
   this concept by laboratory and field experiments has yielded encouraging
   results. The laboratory system gave an average of 50\% reduction in zinc
   concentration over a 14 h retention period. The field system presently
   gives a 22\% average reduction in zinc concentration over a similar
   retention time. With further development, it is hoped that ALDs could
   become a cheap and attractive unit process for treating drainage from
   abandoned mines. particularly in situations where conventional treatment
   is not feasible on economic or practical grounds. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Organic waste materials were tested as the electron donors for sulphate
   reducers in treating acid mind drainage. They are oak chips (OC), spent
   oak From shiitake farms (SOS), spent mushroom compost (SMC), sludge from
   a wastepaper recycling plant (SWP) and organic-rich soil (ORS). The
   materials were placed in column reactors, which were inoculated by
   anaerobic digester fluid. The number of sulphate-reducers increased to
   10(8)-10(9) cells/ml in 2 weeks in the reactors. The reactors were
   continuously fed with simulated mine drainage for 35 weeks to determine
   sulphate reduction and metal removal. SOS, SMC and SWP served better as
   electron donors than OC and ORS. Metal removal efficiency of the reactor
   with OC was lower than those with SOS, SMC and SWP at the beginning, but
   became comparable at a later stage. The solvent extractable of OC
   inhibited the growth of sulphate-reducers. Cellulose polysaccharides
   were the main components of the waste materials consumed in the
   reactors. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The total P in soil solution can be divided into three procedurally
   defined components namely molybdate reactive P (MRP), organic P (OP) and
   condensed P (CP). The amounts of these components in different size
   fractions of soil solution from a peaty podzol was determined using 1.6
   and 1.2-mu m filters to remove particles, and 0.45- and 0.22-mu m
   filters to remove colloids. For MRP, 55\% was associated with particles
   >1.2 mu m and a further 23\% with colloids >0.22 mu m. For OF, 34\% was
   associated with particles > 1.2 mu m and a further 46\% with colloids
   >0.22 mu m in size. CP behaved differently with no significant amount (P
   greater than or equal to 0.05) associated with particles >1.2 mu m, and
   around 54\% associated with colloids >0.22 mu m. In a separate
   experiment, the distribution of MRP, OP and CP in different molecular
   sized fractions of 0.45-mu m filtered soil solution was determined using
   100-. 10- and 1-kD ultrafilters in a stirred cell, part filtering the
   soil solution to minimize compositional changes in the retained
   fraction, and adding NaCl to minimize electrostatic exclusion. The
   0.45-mu m filtrate contained 116 of MRP, 212 of OP and 332 mu g dm(-3)
   of CP. Ultrafiltration showed 32\% of the MRP, 95\% of the OP and 90\%
   of the CP was > 10 kD. During ultrafiltration a gel, containing P mostly
   as OF, accumulated on the tilter. The results highlight the quantitative
   importance of P associated with particulate, colloidal and high
   molecular weight materials in soil solution from an organic soil. (C)

Abstract = {{Full-scale application of leachate recirculation has been hampered by an
   inability to uniformly apply leachate to the waste mass. Much of this
   problem is due to the varied nature of the disposed waste which promotes
   preferential routing and short-circuiting of leachate flows. The United
   States Geological Survey's Saturated-Unsaturated Flow and Transport
   (SUTRA) model {[}Voss C. I. (1984) SUTRA, saturated-unsaturated
   Transport, A Finite-Element Simulation Model for Saturated-Unsaturated,
   Fluid-Density-Dependent Ground-Water Flow with Energy Transport or
   Chemically Reactive Single-species Solute Transport, US Geological
   Survey, National Center, Reston, VA.] was used to model leachate
   application to homogeneous anisotropic and heterogeneous waste masses.
   The homogeneous anisotropic scenario was modeled using vertical
   hydraulic conductivities of 10(-3) and 10(-4) cm/s while the horizontal
   hydraulic conductivity was simulated as one order of magnitude higher
   than these values. The heterogeneous waste mass was simulated by
   applying statistical relationships to the local hydraulic
   conductivities. Normal, exponentially increasing, and exponentially
   decreasing probability density functions (PDFs) were used to model the
   frequency-hydraulic conductivity relationship. Median hydraulic
   conductivities of 10-3 and 10(-4) cm/s with hydraulic conductivity
   ranges of 10(-1)-10(-5) cm/s and 10(-2)-10(-6) cm/s, respectively, were
   simulated for each probability distribution. Leachate was applied 8
   h/day via a horizontal trench at a daily rate of 4 m(3)/m of trench.
   Saturation iso-clines are used to illustrate the effect of the waste
   mass hydraulic parameters on leachate routing. The ability to develop
   predictions and evaluate a variety of different scenarios without the
   effort and expense of physical experimentation is a great strength of
   mathematical models. However, a model's predictive capabilities must be
   verified by comparing the model results with field studies. In an
   attempt to verify model estimations, SUTRA was used to simulate the site
   recirculation system and operational procedures used at the Delaware
   Solid Waste Authority Test Calls and the Yolo County Leachate
   Recirculation Demonstration Project. Cumulative measured and simulated
   leachate generation were compared. Results From this verification effort
   indicate that channeled Row is the major leachate movement mechanism
   that is not well understood at this time. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The start-up and performance of four anaerobic baffled reactors (ABR,
   each of 101 and eight compartments) treating a complex dilute soluble or
   colloidal wastewater (milk and colloidal rice and dog food - 500 mg
   COD/1) was studied. All four were started with a hydraulic retention
   time (HRT) of 80 h at 35 degrees C and this was steadily reduced to 6 h;
   all the HRTs tested resulted in more than 80\% COD removal. In one ABR
   an HRT as low as 1.3 h was tested over a period of 2 d and even at this
   high flow rate a COD removal of 40\% was obtained. The production of
   soluble microbial products (SMP) was round to be greater in the reactors
   being fed colloidal material, possibly due to `differences' in
   solubility and composition, and these were potentially refractory
   resulting in slightly lower COD removals than in the milk reactor. The
   biomass content of the reactors did not appear to influence SMP
   production, however, as HRTs were reduced, more SMPs were produced.
   Anaerobic bioassays were used to evaluate the activity of the biomass on
   the: different wastewaters and their biodegradability. It was found that
   the initial activity on both the soluble and colloidal wastewater were
   of the same order of magnitude and hence solid hydrolysis was not
   limiting the rate or extent of degradation. Residence time distribution
   studies were carried our to monitor the effect of system characteristics
   such as HRT, solids content and feed composition on the hydrodynamic
   flow characteristics and dead space in each ABR. Little difference in
   mixing or dead space was observed under the different conditions tested.
   The average dead space measured was 20-37\% and the flow pattern within
   the reactors showed an intermediate behaviour between plug-flow and
   ideally mixed, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIFS) is fairly
   accepted as a fast and reliable method for the online detection of
   contaminations with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oil in
   groundwater and soils. Our work was focussed not only on the assessment
   of those contaminations, but on the use of LIFS as a generic tool to
   assess subsurface contaminations and aquifer properties. Pattern
   recognition techniques were successfully applied to map contaminant
   plumes surrounding waste disposal sites. Remediation activities at a
   former gas plant site were monitored using a sensor system based on
   time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Tracer investigations in the
   saturated and unsaturated zone were enhanced due to the small time
   intervals between the single measurements. The determination of single
   analytes (e.g. pyrene, benzo(a)pyrene) out of a complex mixture of
   fluorescent compounds was possible by taking advantage of the
   fluorescence decay-times and by applying a site-specific calibration.

Abstract = {{A simple surface complexation model, the double-laver model (DLM)I was
   used to describe the sorption of Cu(II) on a lignocellulosic substrate
   extracted from wheat bran. The solid was first characterized by IR and
   C-13-NMR and the binding of protons was studied by potentiometric
   titrations. The organic solid was represented by two acid sites. From
   the acid-base titration data, total concentrations of these sites and H+
   binding constants (SiOH - SiO- + H+) were obtained by using the computer
   program FITEQL 3.2.
   The binding of Cu(II) was then investigated. The thermodynamic approach
   was completed by two spectroscopic studies. A laser
   microspectrofluorimetry study was used to specify the adsorption
   phenomena. The square planar geometry of the solid/Cu complexes and the
   formation of inner-sphere complexes were suggested by an ESR study.
   After identifying the stoichiometry of the surface complexes by
   potentiometric titrations of the Cu2+/solid system, the: surface
   complexation model was applied to describe Cu(II) binding by the
   lignocellulosic substrate, A single set of data was used: the model fit
   was good and covered a wide range of pH. The surface complexation
   constants derived From this single metal data set were then used to
   predict the sorption for increasing metal loading, different solid to
   solution ratios or different ionic strength. The predictions agreed well
   with the experimental data showing the capability for the DLM surface
   complexation model to describe Cu binding to natural organic matter with
   a minimum number of adjustable parameters (only five parameters were
   necessary to describe the data). (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The destruction of ethanolamine by ozonation in aqueous medium was
   studied. The effectiveness of ozonation was estimated by the degree of
   conversion alpha {[}\%], and by the rate constant, k {[}min(-1)], which
   was calculated from a first-order kinetic equation. The activation
   energy of the process was calculated from the rate constant vs
   temperature relationship according to the Arrhenius equation. The effect
   of pH of the medium and temperature, T, on the effectiveness of
   ozonation was investigated. It was established that ozonation of
   ethanolamine is most effective at T = 283 K and pH = 11.0. Under these
   conditions the rate constant has its high value 0.118 min(-1). At pH =
   11.0 the effect of the temperature on the rate constant is stronger
   which can be explained with the high value of the activation energy of
   the process. The amount of the residual ozone in gaseous phase was
   determined and the possibility of its decomposition on a catalyst of
   higher nickel oxide was studied. The effect of the amount of catalyst on

Abstract = {{Laboratory studies were conducted using salt marsh cores to determine
   the oxygen demand exerted by spilled crude oil and fertilizers added to
   stimulate biodegradation. Measurements of oxygen uptake and CO2 efflux
   in flooded and non-flooded cores were conducted in addition to
   measurements of the magnitude and depth distribution of sulfate
   reduction rates using (SO42-)-S-35. Additions of crude oil and
   fertilizers increased sediment oxygen demand (SOD) by a factor of 1.5 to
   through a combination of enhanced aerobic respiration and sulfate
   reduction. A strong dependency was observed between the oxygen demand
   and the overlying dissolved oxygen concentration when crude oil and
   fertilizers were added. Oiled,Fertilized cores did nor exhibit an SOD
   higher than control cores when overlying dissolved oxygen levels dropped
   below 5 mg/l. Crude oil stimulated sulfate reduction rates by a factor
   of two under flooded and non-flooded conditions. Highest sulfate
   reduction rates were observed in the top 2cm of marsh. Oxygen demand was
   apportioned between sulfide oxidation and aerobic respiration.
   Appointment of SOD indicated that despite doubling of the sulfate
   reduction rate, most of the demand in non-flooded cores (65\%) is
   exerted by aerobic respiration with the majority of this demand exerted
   by hydrocarbon degrading organisms. When examined together, data
   indicate that significant biodegradation of crude oil in salt marshes
   occurs only when the tidal cycle exposes the surface of the salt marsh
   to the atmosphere. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The degradation of phenol by microflora of petroleum refining sediments
   grown under conditions favouring denitrification was studied. Incubation
   of sediments at 30 and 55 degrees C in medium with phenol and nitrate
   resulted in complete reduction of nitrate accompanied by accumulation of
   nitrite. When the sediments were incubated at 30 degrees C in medium
   with nitrite, phenol was efficiently removed at nitrite concentrations
   not exceeding 185 mg NO2--N 1(-1). Prolonged pressure of phenol (2.6 mM)
   and nitrile (8.2-20 mM) on the microflora of the sediments (three
   consecutive passages) resulted in gradual loss of denitrification
   activity with unaltered phenol activity. The microflora selected from
   the sediments demonstrated higher phenol activity in medium without
   external electron acceptor than in media with NO3-, NO2- or SO42-. (C)

Abstract = {{A methodology for predicting the thermal enhancement of stormwater
   runoff from paved surfaces is documented for a test facility in
   Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Prediction of runoff temperature is based on
   TRMPAVE, a mathematical model that was developed using a thermal energy
   balance approach and the one-dimensional heat equation to predict the
   surface temperature and temperature gradient in asphalt during
   dry-weather and wet-weather periods. Runoff temperature is then
   estimated as a Function of rainwater temperature and surface temperature
   of the asphalt. In order to supplement wet-weather datal a number of
   simulated rainfall events H-err generated over a rest plot to help
   develop, calibrate and verify the wet-weather model. Computer
   simulations For both dry and wet-weather periods compared well with
   measurements of temperature from the test plot. In addition, the average
   temperature of runoff contributed by the entire parking lot area was
   cooler than the average temperature of runoff from the test plot, but
   both values were higher than runoff from the upstream catchment. In
   light of the results obtained, TRMPAVE can be used to predict thermal
   loading from impervious areas. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Phosphate in wastewater effluent is implicated in eutrophication of
   water reserves. Enhanced biological phosphate removal by activated
   sludge is attributed to polyphosphate accumulating bacteria, which
   release phosphate during anaerobiosis and reincorporate it during
   aerobiosis. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the process
   of phosphate removal by activated sludge could be probed
   immunochemically. Antigen preparations from the aerobic and preceding
   anoxic zones of a phosphate removing system contained intact and lysed
   bacterial cells. Neither conventional nor subtractive immunisation
   strategies, the latter employing cyclophosphamide to immunofocus on
   unique epitopes in the zones, provided antibodies capable of
   distinguishing between these Zones. However, a putatively
   protein-directed monoclonal antibody could distinguish between the
   aerobic zones of two activated sludge systems, differing only in
   phosphate removal ability: immunoblot showed Eve discrete bands, with
   molecular weights appearing to be multiples of 18 kDa, unique to the
   system successful at phosphate removal. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{A toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) was conducted on effluent
   from a major industrial discharger. Although initial monitoring
   typically showed only slight, intermittent, chronic toxicity to
   Ceriodaphnia dubia. a later sample showed substantial acute toxicity to
   C. dubia (48-h lc(50) = 9\%). Acute phase I toxicity characterization
   tests were conducted on this acutely toxic sample; none of the phase I
   manipulations reduced sample toxicity. The toxic effluent sample was
   then treated with activated carbon, and cation, anion, and mixed-bed ion
   exchange. Acute toxicity was not reduced by treatment with activated
   carbon or cation exchange, but was completely removed by anion and
   mixed-bed ion exchange. Based on these data, we concluded that the
   causative toxicant(s) was likely an inorganic anion(s); chemical
   analysis detected hexavalent chromium Cr{[}VI] at concentrations
   sufficient to account for the observed acute toxicity. Although Cr{[}VI]
   could clearly explain the presence of acute toxicity, subsequent
   confirmation testing was designed to determine whether Cr{[}IV] was
   responsible for the low-level chronic toxicity more typical of the
   effluent. Concurrent chronic tests conducted on unaltered and
   anion-exchanged effluent showed that the presence of chronic toxicity
   was associated with chronically toxic concentrations of Cr{[}VI]. The
   source of Cr{[}VI] in the effluent was traced to a malfunctioning heat
   exchanger. after this malfunction was corrected, neither chronic
   toxicity nor appreciable Cr{[}VI] was observed in the effluent again.

Abstract = {{The formation of soluble microbial products (SMPs) during a drinking
   water ozone-biofiltration process was estimated using two approaches.
   First, a model was developed that related the assimilation of
   biodegradable organic matter (BOM) to the accumulation of biomass on
   filter media. The model was calibrated with data from a regularly
   backwashed, pilot scale biofilter that approximated a steady-state plug
   flow reactor. The second approach was a direct measurement of SMP
   concentrations, accomplished by applying a synthetic water comprised of
   known compounds to a bio-acclimated filter. The SMP concentration was
   estimated by determining the difference between known-compound removal
   (on a carbon basis) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal,
   Comparable results were obtained from both approaches. SMPs were found
   to be important relative to the carbon removal that is typically
   measured (DOC), indicating that this measurement can significantly
   underestimate the actual BOM removal (17-33\% in this research). The
   concentration of SMPs was negligible relative to the filter effluent DOC
   pool. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Ficklin anion exchange method for separation of arsenate and

   suitable field separation techniques other than ion exchange. Ion
   exchange separations were performed on the four arsenic species common
   in drinking water sources using the Ficklin method. The common organic
   arsenic species elute with arsenite. This implies that the use of the
   Ficklin method to speciate waters bearing organic arsenic all have the
   undesirable consequence of Falsely indicating higher concentrations of

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The practicability of using the natural depuration method in Hung Kong
   for cleansing shellfish harvested before being sold for human
   consumption as routinely practised by some countries was examined. The
   method was based on the assumption that faecally-contaminated shellfish
   would quickly release the accumulated microorganisms into the
   surrounding water when they were placed in a natural environment with
   clean water. Hence, we first monitored the level of Escherichia coli in
   mussels and their growing-water in Tap Mun of Hong Kong; for 12
   consecutive months to confirm whether acceptable bacteriological quality
   mussels could be obtained from a rearing site with good water quality.
   The site chosen for the present study had comparatively good
   bacteriological water quality (with an annual geometric mean E. coli
   density of 12 per 100 mi). To the contrary, mussels harvested there were
   often found to contain many rimes more E. coli (average 2 x 10(3) E.
   coli per 100 g flesh) than that in the water. In vitro study by
   immersing UV-depurated clean mussels (containing less than 5 E, coli per
   100 g flesh) in sterile seawater inoculated with high concentrations of
   E. coli (2.6 x 10(3) and 2.9 x 10(5) per 100 mi, respectively, in
   different experiments) revealed that: (a) E. coli uptake by mussels
   commenced almost immediately; (b) levels of E. coli accumulated peaked
   with 3 to 5 h of exposure and reached about 50 to 100 fold as much as
   that in the seawater; (c) levels of E, coli accumulated subsequently
   declined, first sharply, then at ii slower rate within the next 15 to 20
   h to approximately 0.2\% of the peak level at the end of the experiment;
   (d) a slight uptake of E. toil was again observed in all experiments at
   around 25 to 30 and 40 to 35 hi and (e) the level of E, coli in the
   mussels remained more or less the same thereafter. The in vitro study
   results suggested that once shellfish had accumulated a high level of
   microorganisms, natural depuration or purification (by means of relaying
   contaminated shellfish in a body of clean water for some time before
   sale) might not necessarily be a reliable method to achieve an
   acceptable microbiological quality of shellfish for human consumption.
   In view of the local environmental water quality, cleansing shellfish by
   purification in the natural environment may not be practical in Hong
   Kong. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd, All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sampling procedures for the standard method for measuring dissolved
   ozone concentrations in water were modified by replacing narrow-necked
   volumetric Basks with wide-necked Erlenmeyer Basks, followed by
   gravimetric determination of sample volume. The intent of these
   modifications was to improve sampling ease, speed. and reproducibility
   when collecting large number of samples with highly variable and rapidly
   decaying dissolved ozone concentrations. Subsequent comparisons between
   samples collected by the standard method and the modified gravimetric
   method showed greater apparent ozone concentrations in samples collected
   by the modified method. This difference appears to result from negative
   sampling biases when using volumetric glassware under typical full-scale
   sampling conditions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This review discusses recent trends in chemical speciation of aluminium
   in natural waters. Several difficulties which arise from the complexity
   of aluminium species present in natural samples as well as its
   participation in dynamic equilibrium are highlights. Taking this into
   account various approaches for speciation of Al described in the
   literature are critically evaluated. The strategy of fractionation
   procedures based on the rate of reaction, sorption efficiency,
   chromatographic behaviour of the aluminium compounds or size of the
   molecules are described in the paper. Besides conventional procedures
   involving various measuring and separation techniques, a special
   emphasis is focused on mechanised flow injection methodologies. This was
   found to be very important in order to ensure precise control of the
   reaction time. which is essential in aluminium species equilibrium
   system. The analytical performance of several separation procedures
   based on flow injection approaches as well as the detection methods are
   discussed and compared. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail rights

Abstract = {{The various currently used chemical oxidation processes (AOPs), for
   pesticide elimination from wastewater are reported. Heterogeneous TiO2
   pholocatalysis, ozonation and photo-Fenton's reagent are the most
   intensively investigated technologies. Theoretical and practical
   advantages and limitations of each method are discussed. Degradation
   mechanism and experimental conditions employed for the optimization of
   each technology are reviewed. Performances such as the achieved degree
   of mineralization and obtained degradation rates are detailed. The
   various analytical approaches for studying pesticide degradation by AOPs
   are also discussed. Formation of by-products is unavoidable during cost
   effective treatments. Their detection and identification are required in
   order to determine which kind of chemical structures are left at the end
   of the process. For this purpose, the crucial role of gas and liquid
   mass spectrometry is emphasized. The review reveals a general lack of
   data on kinetics of formation and disappearance of the major
   by-products. The efficiency of AOPs has scarcely been investigated at
   industrial scales, i.e. in presence of a mixture of active ingredients
   together with their formulating agents and at concentration levels above
   10 mg/l. The more polar by-products are largely unknown and their
   toxicity is usually not addressed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The Mai Po Marshes (Hong Kong), which bear an increasing pollution
   burden, are amongst the most threatened regional wetland habitats.
   Contamination of water and thus sediment may result in significant
   impacts upon the wetland ecology. Assessment of sediment contamination
   across the wetland is critical to understanding and managing the
   implications of water pollution. Sediment contamination in the wetland
   is shown to be high. A distinctive spatial distribution of contaminants
   was observed, in that sediments from the southern and northern ends of
   the wetland had significantly higher total nitrogen and total copper
   than other areas. Total phosphorus was more concentrated at the southern
   end, and total zinc was more enriched at the northern end of the
   wetland. The surface (0-8 cm) sediments had significantly higher total
   concentrations of phosphorus and zinc compared to the bottom (8-16 cm)
   sediments. These results indicate the significantly increasing pollution
   pressure from nearby industrial activities and urban expansion. The low
   water solubility (< 10\% of the total content) of all contaminants
   suggests that they may not be readily mobilised across the
   sediment-water interface. This would also explain the low or non toxic
   results of sediment elutriate toxicity tests on luminescent bacteria.

Abstract = {{This paper is an extension of a previous study by (Lau, S. S. S. and
   Chu, L. M. (1999a) The significance of sediment contamination in a
   coastal wetland, Hong Kong, China. Water Research (in press)) which
   focused upon patterns of sediment contamination at the internationally
   important wetlands Mai Po Marshes (Hong Kong), which receive continual
   pollution inputs from Mainland China and Hong Kong. The core aims of the
   present study were to investigate the potential effects of temporal
   variability in the assessment of sediment contamination in subtropical
   inter-tidal wetlands and in the evaluation of the sink-source nature of
   contaminated sediment. Sediment quality was examined for four seasons
   (spring, summer, autumn and winter) across six inter-tidal sites at the
   Marshes. Sediment contamination by total concentrations of Cd, Cu, Ni
   and Zn exceeded fifteen times the background level. Results of one-way
   ANOVA tests showed that the total and soluble concentrations of
   nutrients (N and P) and metals (Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn) in sediments were
   highly temporally dependent, with variations from contaminant to
   contaminant. Significant temporal variability may effect the
   interpretation of contamination assessment and implementation of
   management regimes for subtropical inter-tidal wetland ecosystems.
   Overall, the results ran counter to conventional wisdom that effects of
   temporal variability are negligible in the assessment of sediment
   quality, (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a comparison is made between two means of obtaining the
   parameters for the settling velocity models that are at the core of the
   solid flux theory: (i) the traditional approach using zone settling
   velocity (V(ZS)) data obtained from a dilution experiment and (ii) a new
   direct parameter estimation method relying on a single batch settling
   curve (SBSC). For four distinct sludges, settling curves were recorded
   at different sludge concentrations (X) and the Vesilind parameters were
   calculated in the traditional way. The value of the resulting model was
   evaluated by cross-validating it on its ability to describe complete
   SBSC's. Provided the dynamics of the sludge blanket descent were
   moderate a settler model incorporating these traditional Vesilind
   parameters could reasonably match the experimental batch settling
   curves. However, when the dynamics of the sludge blanket descent were
   fast, the Vesilind model failed. It was tried whether other settling
   velocity models could result in better fits to the SBSC. Here. the Cho
   model turned out to be the most effective one. When cross-validating the
   Cho model on the dilution experiment Cis-data, however, it was found to
   be less performing than the Vesilind model in describing the
   relationship between ii, and X. The fact that the Vesilind model is
   superior to the Cho model in describing such relationships, while the
   Cho model is better in describing complete settling curves, clearly
   points out that current settling models are still very empirical in
   nature. An important finding was that with all settling velocity models
   tested, practical identifiability problems appeared, indicating the need
   for better experimental designs. Finally, the flux curves associated
   with the SBSC-estimated Cho parameters were compared with the
   traditional Vesilind flux curves. Although both types of flux curves
   generally showed similar trends, the reliability of SBSC-based flux
   curve predictions is at present insufficient to warrant replacement of
   the traditional estimation of settling characteristics. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The thin-film technique is becoming a standard for the preparation of
   TiO2-based photocatalysts for organic degradation. The catalyst
   alleviates the drawback of poor settleability associated with the powder
   TiO2 traditionally used. In addition, the thin-film catalyst can be
   connected to an external power source to reduce the recombination of
   UV-activated electrons and holes, thereby increasing the quantum
   efficiency. The immobilization of TiO2 on a solid carrier as a thin-film
   catalyst introduces several mechanisms not normally found in
   conventional TiO2 slurry process. These mechanisms have been identified
   to include at least liquid-film transfer, adsorption, diffusion and
   photocatalytic reaction in a thin-film. A mathematical model was
   developed to incorporate these mechanisms for the photodegradation of
   organic molecules in a batch reactor. The model was verified using the
   data of l-chlorophenol degradation obtained from the literature. The
   thin-film photocatalytic model was then used to investigate the effect
   of catalyst properties on the photodegradation of organics. The
   properties investigated included adsorption capacity, diffusion in the
   catalyst, UV attenuation and film thickness. The results of model
   simulation show that the effects of catalyst properties on the
   degradation of organics are highly nonlinear. There is an optimal film
   thickness that yields a maximum rate of photodegradation. The model not
   only provides insights into the effect of these underlying mechanisms
   but also can be used as a tool to assist the design of a thin-film
   photocatalyst. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{417-426}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Organism distribution in and morphology of biofilms are determined by
   supply of substrate and oxygen and by detachment mechanisms. Based on
   mathematical simulations, competition of autotrophic and heterotrophic
   biomass in a biofilm is discussed for three cases: (1) constant biofilm
   thickness, (2) daily backwashing of the biofilm support media and (3)
   sloughing events in weekly intervals. It is shown that the different
   detachment patterns have a significant influence on the organism
   distribution within the biofilm and on overall process performance.
   Faster growing heterotrophs are favored over autotrophic biomass in
   situations with long intervals between detachment with resulting high
   variations of the biofilm thickness. It is concluded that the
   application of results from mathematical models assuming a constant
   biofilm thickness may be misleading when predicting the performance of
   systems with large fluctuations of the biofilm thickness over time (e.g.
   biofilters with backwashing or trickling filters). Thus, it must also be
   questioned whether results from laboratory experiments in laminar flow
   channels (with a constant erosion) can be used to describe structure and
   function of biofilms in full-scale biofilm reactors with large lime
   dependent fluctuations of the biofilm thickness. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Title = {{Adsorption of Pb and Cd onto metal oxides and organic material in
   natural surface coatings as determined by selective extractions: new
   evidence for the importance of Mn and Fe oxides}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{34}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Surface coatings (biofilms and associated minerals) were collected on
   glass slides in the oxic surface waters of Cayuga Lake (New York State,
   U.S.A.) and were used to evaluate the relative contributions of Fe, Mn
   and Al oxides and organic material to total observed Pb and Cd
   adsorption by the surface coating materials. Several alternative
   selective extraction techniques were evaluated with respect to both
   selectivity and alteration of the residual unextracted material. Pb and
   Cd adsorption was measured under controlled laboratory conditions
   (mineral salts solution with defined metal speciation, ionic strength
   0.05 M, 25 degrees C and pH 6.0) before and after extractions to
   determine by difference the adsorptive properties of the extracted
   component(s). Hydroxylamine hydrochloride (0.01 M NH2OH . HCl + 0.01 M
   HNO3) was used to selectively remove Mn oxides; sodium dithionite (0.3 M
   Na2S2O4) was used to remove Mn and Fe oxides, and 10\% oxalic acid was
   used to remove metal oxides and organic materials. Several other
   extractants were evaluated, but preliminary experiments indicated that
   they were not suitable for these experiments because of undesirable
   alterations of the residual, unextracted material. The selected
   extraction methods removed target components with efficiencies between
   71 and 83\%, but significant amounts of metal oxides and organic
   materials other than the target components were also removed by the
   extractants (up to 39\%). Nonlinear regression analysis of the observed
   Pb and Cd adsorption based on the assumption of additive Langmuir
   adsorption isotherms was used to estimate the relative contributions of
   each surface coating constituent to total Pb and Cd binding of the
   biofilms. Adsorption of Cd to the lake biofilms was dominated by Fe
   oxides, with lesser roles attributed to adsorption by Mn and Al oxides
   and organic material. Adsorption of Pb was dominated by Mn oxides, with
   lesser roles indicated for adsorption to Fe oxides and organic material,
   and the estimated contribution of Al oxides to Pb adsorption was
   insignificant. The fitted Pb adsorption isotherm for Fe oxides was in
   excellent agreement with those obtained through direct experiments and
   reported in independent investigations. The estimated Pb distribution
   between surface coating components also agreed well with that previously
   predicted by an additive adsorption model based on Pb adsorption
   isotherms for laboratory surrogates for Mn, Fe and Al oxides and defined
   biological components, (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The development of intact anaerobic granular sludge was studied in UASB
   reactors under varying conditions of CaCO3 precipitation and biomass
   yield. Varying precipitating quantities were obtained using different
   calcium concentrations in the influent and different biomass yields were
   obtained by feeding with completely or partly acidified substrate. Four
   reactors were operated at a constant organic loading rate of 13 g COD
   l(-1) d(-1). Treatment of completely acidified waste water with high
   calcium concentrations (780-1560 mgCa(2+) l(-1)) resulted in the rapid
   formation of dense granules with a high ash content of which the
   specific methanogenic activity rapidly dropped and which easily
   agglomerated, leading to serious cementation of the sludge bed. At a
   lower influent calcium concentration (390 mgCa(2+) l(-1)), treatment of
   completely acidified waste water resulted in precipitation on reactor
   compartments, while precipitation within the aggregates did hardly take
   place. The presence of a fraction of non-acidified substrate retarded
   cementation of the sludge bed and resulted in development of sludge with
   a high ash content and a satisfactory quality. The biofilm model
   developed was shown to provide a clear, qualitative insight in the
   factors that affect the location of precipitation. and thereby the
   quality of high ash content sludge. Moreover, it explains the
   differences observed in the location of precipitation during the
   experiments. A low Ca/Na ratio, a small granule diameter and a high
   crystallization rate constant (=low CaCO3 growth inhibition) were found
   to stimulate precipitation in the bulk solution, and are considered to
   be favourable parameters for the development of sludge with a high ash
   content and a good quality. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, the behaviour of a sanitary landfill was reproduced in a
   pilot plant under controlled conditions. The experiment was carried out
   in an opaque PVC reactor at 36 +/- 1 degrees C with recirculation of the
   leachates. The municipal solid waste (MSW) employed came from the
   regional landfill site of Asturias and the study was carried out in
   three stages. Firstly, 48.5 kg of MSW were introduced into the pilot
   plant (first cell) and several phases of the waste degradation were
   monitored; the methanogenic phase being reached after 264 days. In the
   second stage, 66 kg of new MSW was added on top of the degraded waste of
   the first stage (second cell). In the third stage, 59 kg of new MSW were
   added on top of the waste digested in the two previous steps (third
   cell). The waste was digested faster in the second and third steps and
   the methanogenic phase was reached earlier (second step: 55\% CH4 on day
   20; third step: 50\% CH4 on day 30). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to assess the possible removal of copper (II)
   or nickel (II) from dilute aqueous solution by a synthetic flocculant
   used in the water treatment field. The copper (II) or nickel (II)
   complex formation with the 3 x 10(6) g mol(-1) average molecular weight
   poly(acrylic acid) (PAA 3 x 10(6)) was examined at pH 6.0, 5.0 and 4.0
   successively using differential pulse polarography as an investigation
   mean. The complexing capacity Cc of the polyacid towards copper (II) at
   pH 6.0 was estimated to be 5.8 mmol Cu (II)/g PAA 3 x 10(6) in the
   operative conditions considered here (NaNO3 0.1 mol l(-1); 25 degrees
   C). The conditional stability constant of the PAA 3 x 10(6)/copper (II)
   complex species was determined using the method proposed by assuming
   that only the 1:1 complex species was formed: log K' = 5.2 +/- 0.2 at pH
   6.0. Both values decreased with the pH of the aqueous medium. Whatever
   the pn considered, all the values of Cc and log K' obtained with nickel
   (II) were significantly lower than these obtained with copper (II); this
   confirmed the conclusions of the previous potentiometric study of the
   PAA 3 x 10(6) complexation properties (). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{One of the best options for handling Mexico City's 74.5 m(3)/s of
   wastewater is to use advanced primary treatment (APT), filter and
   disinfect the effluent before it is reused in agriculture. The final
   effluent must contain less than helminth egg (HE) per liter and less
   than 1000 fecal coliforms (MPN)/100 mL while still retaining nutrients
   and organic matter for their agronomic benefits. Sand and synthetic
   filters were tested on the effluent of a 12 L/s pilot APT plant. The
   average APT effluent concentration of helminth eggs was 1.2 HE/L and
   both fillers produced effluent concentrations ranging from 0 to 0.52
   HE/L. Although the removal efficiencies of the sand and synthetic
   filters were similar, the synthetic filter had several important
   advantages over the sand filter: (a) The filtration rate of the
   synthetic filter was more than 5.8 times that of the sand filter and the
   production rate per run per al ea was 2.1 times than of the sand filler.
   (b) The synthetic filter required less than 1\% of the raw wastewater
   for backwashing, while the sand filler required twice as much filtered
   wastewater. Although, the synthetic filter has higher capital costs and
   has a more complex design and operation, the overall costs would most
   likely be lower due to its higher production rate. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The viability of the fish pathogenic bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida was
   rapidly reduced when exposed to sunlight at about 10(5) lx in river
   water. A 99.9\% inactivation was observed after 2 h exposure. Artificial
   light at 28,000 lx induced inactivation at a lowered rate. If
   pre-exposed to disinfecting doses of ultraviolet C irradiation in the
   river water, sunlight illumination induced rapid initial photorecovery
   followed by inactivation as outlined above. After reducing the number of
   colony-forming units to 0.08\% of the initial count in an experimental
   UV system, a 160-fold recovery within 20 min of sunlight exposure was
   observed. However, after 2 h of sunlight exposure. the viable count was
   down again to 0.07\% of the initial value. The presence of humic acid
   accelerated the photoinactivating effect while sodium chloride at 0.9\%
   concentration increased survivability of both light-stressed and
   dark-incubated bacteria. The marine bacterium Vibrio anguillarum showed
   a slower response than A. salmonicida, both with respect to
   sunlight-induced inactivation and photorepair. In non-irradiated cells,
   the viable count was reduced by 97.5\% after 3 h, while 1 h was needed
   to obtain a maximum of 19-fold photorecovery in sunlight after UV-C
   irradiation. It is concluded that sunlight induced processes should be
   taken into consideration when assessing the survival of fish pathogens
   in surface waters and the UV disinfection efficiency towards inlet and
   effluent water of aquacultural installations. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to test the possible influence of
   different taxonomic determination levels on several commonly used
   indices. Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera communities of five
   acidified and three reference headwater streams were sampled 11 times
   during one year, providing quantitative faunistic lists. Richness, four
   diversity indices and two similarity indices were compared when
   calculated from species, genus and Family determination levels. The
   results showed that high taxonomic level determinations lead to
   underestimation of all indices excepted for Jaccard which was
   overestimated. Underestimation was generally higher For communities of
   reference streams than for impacted streams. Consequently,
   determinations to family level make the interpretation of metric values
   very hazardous, especially when indices are used to assess both water
   quality and macroinvertebrate community changes. (C) 1999 Elsevier

   basin treatment systems, were compared under conservative conditions of
   elevated sludge age (i.e. 15-25 days) and hydraulic retention times
   (i.e. 0.5-1 day and 15 days for the respective systems) as well as
   moderate temperatures for the treatment of softwood kraft bleachery
   effluents from a modernized mill using oxygen delignification and 60\%

   achieved with the optimized activated sludge, facultative stabilization

   consistently high removals of conventional organic contaminants,
   polychlorinated phenolics (i.e. 85-93\%), adsorbable organic halogen
   (i.e. 43-58\%) and toxicity. The high level of polychlorinated phenolics
   removal was considered representative of an enhanced treatment
   capability for hard-to-degrade organics. The ultimate degree of

Abstract = {{A combined system of cellulose-based fibrous materials and
   polyelectrolytes has been studied for the recovery of proteins and other
   biological compounds from wastewaters from a typical food processing
   plant. Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) interacts with biomolecules by
   electrostatic and polymer bridging, while cellulose triacetate fibrets
   (CTF) facilitate flee growth by adsorption and bridging of primary
   particles and by entrapment of small aggregates within their highly
   fibrillated microstructure. Final slurries have good filtration
   properties, resulting in a dry and easy to handle filter cake, which
   could be recovered as animal feed. The final filtrate has high water
   clarity and low protein concentration. This recovery system exhibits
   high reductions in total suspended solids (TSS), total Kjeldahl nitrogen
   (TKN), ammonia, oils and greases, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and
   total Fecal coliforms. The final levels of TSS, oils and greases and
   ammonia are below regulatory limits. Reduction of BOD reached 90\%.
   although final concentrations are slightly higher than the regulatory
   levels, (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Intertidal sediment samples from three EU recognised bathing waters in
   Morecambe Bay, Lancashire, U.K. (Morecambe North, Morecambe South and
   Heysham) were analysed for thermophilic campylobacters, salmonellae,
   faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci over a 12-month period.
   Campylobacters show a strong seasonality. They are generally absent in
   the summer months but are consistently present in the winter. The main
   Campylobacter species isolated were C. lari and urease-positive
   thermophilic campylobacters (UPTC), both of which are associated with
   avian hosts. C. jejuni and C. coli and Salmonella were not isolated from
   the sediments. Faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci were isolated
   throughout the year with no obvious seasonal trends in their numbers.
   Higher numbers were found at Morecambe North and South than at Heysham.
   There was no discernible relationship between the numbers of
   campylobacters and faecal indicators. Faecal indicators were found
   predominantly in the surface layers of the sediments and declined in
   number with depth. Campylobacters were restricted to the surface layer.
   Experimental results for the lit situ deposition of bacteria onto clean,
   sterile surfaces from the water column during tidal cover showed
   deposition rates equivalent to approximately 0.1\% of the total
   population of faecal coliforms, 0.01\% of the faecal streptococci and
   1\% of the campylobacters in the sediments. These rates of accretion
   were not high enough to be detected during routine sampling carried out
   before and after high water, using standard methods. The results show
   that the sediments act as a reservoir for bacteria, especially the
   faecal indicators. In rough weather resuspension can contribute
   significantly to bacterial numbers in the surface waters. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Spare nitrification capacity is usually needed for a nitrifying
   activated sludge plant to counter nitrogen shock loads and/or toxicity
   incidents. The traditional way to provide this capacity is to apply a
   sludge retention time that is much longer than needed for treating
   ordinary loads, resulting in over-designed plants. The approach
   investigated in this paper is to store the spare biomass in a separate
   sludge storage tank and return it to the main stream process when a
   shock nitrogen load or an inhibition/toxicity incident occurs,
   Model-based analysis reveals that, in such a plant, inert solids stay
   significantly shorter than the active biomass. This implies that one may
   extend the retention time of the active biomass to the required level
   without raising the retention time of the inert solids to the same
   level. giving rise to the possibility of reducing the size of the plant.
   Savings on tank volume are estimated to be typically around 20\%.
   Experimental studies carried out on a pilot plant confirmed the
   theoretical results. Furthermore, they revealed that the decay rate of
   the nitrifiers in the storage tank could be maintained at a low level by
   intermittently aerating the sludge, so that an even smaller storage tank
   is required. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{557-565}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Fouling of rotating disk membranes as function of operating conditions
   and Feed suspension characteristics was investigated in a series of
   laboratory experiments. A single-disk laboratory unit was operated over
   a range of disk rotation speeds and permeation rates (as controlled by
   the global transmembrane pressure drop) that were calculated to favor
   various conditions of particle transport and deposition. Permeate flux
   was found to be relatively insensitive to particle concentration in the
   feed stream. Thus, this membrane configuration appears to be well suited
   to the treatment of suspensions at high concentrations. However, the
   interplay between appropriate operating conditions to maintain permeate
   Bur and the size of particles in the feed suspensions must be taken into
   account. Fouling was found to decrease with rotation rate and increase
   with transmembrane pressure (and therefore the initial permeate flux).
   Reductions in fouling observed at higher rotational speeds are
   attributed primarily to a high centrifugal force and radial component of
   drag on particles near the membrane surface. However, a trade off exists
   between the generation of high shear rates and centrifugal accelerations
   via high rotation rates and the radial distribution of the transmembrane
   pressure drop across the membrane that may locally reduce or reverse the
   Row of permeate across the membrane. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Dichloromethane, added as sole source of carbon and energy, was utilized
   by microorganisms in a packed-bed reactor under carbon dioxide-,
   sulfate-, nitrate- and nitrite-reducing conditions. Only in the presence
   of nitrite (4 mM) was the transformation of dichloromethane partly
   inhibited. The maximum transformation rate for dichloromethane under
   carbon dioxide reducing conditions was 1.25 kg m(-3) d(-1). Carbon
   dioxide, acetate and formate were detected as (intermediate) products of
   dichloromethane transformation in the reactor, indicating that it was a
   Fermentative process. Both acetate and formate, when formed, were
   fur-ther utilized. The type of microorganisms that utilized formate and
   acetate depended on the electron acceptor present in the reactor. When
   carbon dioxide was the only electron acceptor available, acetate and
   formate were utilized by methanogens as indicated by methane production.
   When sulfate, nitrate or nitrite were present in the reactor, acetate
   and formate were utilized by sulfate-, nitrate- or nitrite-reducing
   microorganisms, respectively. Inhibition of methanogens with
   2-bromoethane sulfonic acid or of sulfate reduction with molybdate had
   no effect on the utilization of dichloromethane in enrichment cultures
   from the reactor. Also the presence of nitrate or nitrite was not
   necessary for the transformation of dichloromethane. These results
   suggested that neither methanogens nor sulfate-, nitrate- and
   nitrite-reducers were involved in the transformation of dichloromethane
   but that these organisms only utilized acetate and formate, the products
   of dichloromethane fermentation in the reactor. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Drinking water biofilm communities originated from distribution systems
   in Hamburg, Berlin, Mainz and Stockholm were subjected to a
   top-to-bottom in situ analysis with rRNA-targeted, fluorescently labeled
   oligonucleotide probes including: beta1-8. specific for drinking water
   bacteria within the beta-subclass of Proteobacteria. Independent from
   the raw water source used, between 19 and 77\% of the total attached
   bacterial cell counts on polyethylen slides could be hybridized with
   probes beta1-8 and 19-53\% of the bacteria were affiliated to the
   autochthonous species Aquabacterium commune. To investigate seasonal
   fluctuations of the bacterial population composition, polyethylen slides
   exposed during different times of the year were analyzed. Although
   changes in the species composition of the biofilms could be observed, A.
   commune was a dominant community member in all of the investigated
   biofilms. lit situ probing with two oligonucleotide probes specific for
   A. commune revealed that during distinct sampling times an additional
   yet unknown species was present in the biofilm, Material induced
   population shifts were studied using glass, polyethylene low and high
   density and soft-PVC as biofilm substrata. The community composition on
   soft-PVC differed significantly from the other materials, the dominant
   species A. commune was replaced by other beta-Proteobacteria hybridizing

Abstract = {{This study reports on the Fenton and photo-assisted Fenton treatment of
   textile waste waters from nanofiltration of biologically treated
   secondary textile industry effluents produced in a large scale plant in
   Northern of Italy. The influence of the hydrodynamic and chemical
   parameters affecting the degradation of the non-biodegradable residues
   of textile waters being continuously replaced near the light source were
   studied in a flow reactor. Cu2+ + Fe2+/3+-ions mediated oxidation
   processes under light analogous to the Haber-Weiss cycle were found to
   be suitable to degrade the recalcitrant part of the textile waters after
   the initial biological treatment. The optical absorption of the
   iron-chromophore and the spectral emission of the light source used but
   not the intensity of the applied light were the most important factors
   determining the kinetics and efficiency of the applied treatment. A
   single polynomial exponential expression was constructed for the
   treatment of the experimental data to make the most economical use of
   the oxidant, electrical energy and processing time. This approach
   allowed the prediction of the lowest final TOC values when optimizing
   the main variables affecting the degradation via phenomenological
   modeling. Insight is given into the way of handling simultaneously the
   optimization of five chemical and physical variables intervening in the
   degradation process by way of a program on a desk computer. As a result
   the data from the degradation runs were used to evaluate the
   coefficients of the polynomial exponential expression rendering
   2D-contour surface plots. A correlation factor >95\% was found between
   the experimental and the values predicted by the mathematical expression
   following an exponential decay law. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Magnesium chloride, as compared to alum and polyaluminium chloride (PAC)
   is a less commonly used coagulant in the field of wastewater treatment,
   with a cost in between alum and PAC. It has been used in this study as a
   coagulant to investigate the effectiveness in the chemical precipitation
   method for the removal of colouring matters. The colour concentration of
   dye solutions was measured by visible spectrophotometry. Parameters such
   as the effect of pH, the effect of coagulant and coagulant aid dosages
   and the effect of different coagulants have been studied. The results
   show that MgCl2 is capable of removing more than 90\% of the colouring
   material at a pH of 11 and a dose of 4 g MgCl2/l of dye solution. MgCl2
   is shown to be more effective in removing reactive dye than alum and PAC
   in terms of settling time and amount of alkalinity required. Optimal
   operating conditions such as pH value. coagulant dose and effect of
   polyelectrolyte have been determined. Wastewaters of a dyeing and
   printing mill on different days have been treated by MgCl2 aqueous
   solution in bench scale. The treatment of the industrial waste has shown
   a reduction of 88\% in COD and 95\% of suspended solids. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Biofilms grown in two submerged nitrifying biofilters developed the
   capability to overcome inhibition caused by free ammonia during a 6
   month period. The biofilters were started with different start-up
   protocols, fed with the same synthetic waste-water and further operated
   under the same conditions for 6 months. The threshold value of free
   ammonia concentration over which ammonia and nitrite oxidisers
   experienced inhibition was evaluated on biomass basis and named specific
   free ammonia concentration.
   The initial biofilter colonisation by nitrite oxidisers appeared to be
   influenced by the start-up conditions. A nitrite accumulation of 65\%
   was observed for the filter started in batch mode while an accumulation
   of only 30\% was obtained in the filter started in continuous flow mode.
   Six months after start-up, nitrite oxidisers showed increasing
   activities for the same specific free ammonia concentration, specially
   in the filter started in batch mode, which appeared to be a consequence
   of the capability of the nitrifying microorganisms to become acclimated
   to higher concentrations of free ammonia. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Biological treatment of a piggery wastewater for organic carbon and
   nitrogen removal in a combined anaerobic-aerobic system was investigated
   using two laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactors. The cycle length
   was 24 h. In the anaerobic reactor. fed with raw wastewater and
   recycling from the aerobic reactor, denitrification followed by
   anaerobic digestion of organic carbon was observed. In the aerobic
   reactor, more organic carbon removal and ammonia oxidation to mainly
   nitrite occurred. Denitrification was also observed in the aerobic
   reactor during the filling period, when mixed liquor dissolved oxygen
   concentration was very low. Three recycle-to-influent ratios from 1 to 3
   were tested. Average performances of the overall process, in the
   different conditions tested, were a TOC removal of 81 to 91\% and 85 to
   91\% of TKN. 10 to 25\% of the initial TKN was discharged as N-NOx
   because of the low recycle-to-influent ratios used. The higher the
   recycle-to-influent ratio, the lower the concentrations of nitrogen
   oxides in the final effluent. However, the effect of this ratio was
   attenuated by the phenomenon of denitrification in the aerobic reactor
   which increased the performances of the process. (C) 1999 Elsevier

   the treatment of mineral oil-contaminated wastewater. Air the
   experimental runs have been performed in a 0.2-1 semicontinuous reactor

   O-3/UV is capable of achieving high levels of purity ranging from 80 to
   90\% abatement of the inlet COD with reaction times not longer than 30

Abstract = {{Nitrification was shown to be important in the nitrogen cycle of intact

   employed sediment biofilm reactors (SBR) with a continuous throughflow
   of water and solutes and used the one-dimensional advection-dispersion
   and transformation model to simulate SBR output ammonium and nitrate
   concentrations. An average input nitrogen flux of 1.7 mu g NH4-N min(-1)
   saturated ammonium retention in streambed sediments. Nitrification rates
   ranged between 4 and 20 ng N min(-1) g(-1) dry mass sediment and its
   efficiency amounted 85\%. In order to better understand the coupled
   effect of both nitrogen and carbon cycles in stream sediments, we
   performed simultaneous and successive glucose/ammonium additions. In
   this experiments, nitrification efficiency decreased to 31-45\%. We
   present first evidence, that pulses of highly available carbon can shift
   the microbial biofilm community from predominantly chemoautotrophy to
   predominantly heterotrophy in the La Solana streambed. Under these
   conditions, heterotrophic bacteria can potentially compete for ammonium
   with nitrifiers. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The efficacy of magnesium-enriched liquid bittern in the treatment of a
   variety of industrial wastewaters was investigated. Fresh samples of
   effluents collected from such industries as ceramic, pulp and cardboard,
   dairy products, marble tiles, tannery and ready-mix concrete were
   initially adjusted to pH levels of 11.4 +/- 0.1 by the addition of
   slaked lime. Serial dosages of liquid bittern were added, and the jar
   test technique was used to determine the impact of the process on a
   number of determinant parameters. The investigation also included
   bacterial population suppression, and carbonation involving the use of
   dry ice (CO2) to adjust the effluent pH in order to meet discharge
   standards. Thr liquid bittern, with a potential for mass production by
   solar evaporation of seawater in coastal areas, was found to be an
   effective and economic coagulant in the treatment of industrial
   wastewaters. Turbidity and total suspended solids removals have exceeded
   95\%, while the chemical oxygen demand removals ranged from 40 to 99\%,
   depending on the type of industry. Besides its reduced bulk when
   compared to seawater as the Mg2+ sourer, liquid bittern has the added
   advantage of inducing the least increase in total dissolved solids in
   the treated effluent. A high degree of total and fecal coliform bacteria
   were removed from the supernatant liquid under the experimental
   conditions applied. Additions of (CO2) in amounts ranging from 3.8 to
   36.6 ml/l depending on pH and alkalinity prior to carbonation of the
   effluent were needed to neutralize the alkalized industrial wastewaters.

Abstract = {{The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the effect of
   dissolved solids on the size of aggregated particles produced by
   freeze-thaw conditioning. The dissolved solids content was varied by
   adding 0-2000 mg/l NaCl to samples of alum sludge. The effect of the
   dissolved solids was observed by taking photographs of thin sections of
   each frozen sample and measuring the resulting aggregated particle
   sizes. The results of this study indicate that a relatively small amount
   of dissolved solids (500 mg/l NaCl or less) can cause ice crystal growth
   to change from columnar to dendritic. As a result, the mean aggregated
   particle size was reduced by approximately 50\%. These results explain
   why the aggregated particles from alum sludge are larger than those
   produced from wastewater sludge. Generally, alum sludge contains very
   little dissolved solids, so crystal growth is columnar. Conversely,
   since wastewater sludges usually contain a significant amount of
   dissolved solids, crystal growth becomes dendritic. Thin sections
   photographed between cross polarizers reveal that most of the aggregated
   particles were contained within individual ice crystals and not at the
   crystal boundaries. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   the bed. The critical shear stress for beds deposited under shear was up
   to eight times larger than that for beds deposited under quiescent
   conditions. The results suggest that modeling efforts which do not take
   into account the history of the bed formation may seriously
   underestimate the bed strength and as such, can result in erroneous
   predictions of sediment and contaminant source. Fate and effect. (C)

Abstract = {{An inverse turbulent bed was investigated for anaerobic digestion. In
   this reactor, a granular floating solid is expanded by an up-flow
   current of gas. The carrier particles (Extendospheres(R)) were chosen
   for their large specific surface area (20000 m(2) m(-3)) and their low
   energy requirements for fluidization (gas velocity of 1.5 mm s(-1), 5.4
   m h(-1)). It was tested with wine distillery wastewater and presented
   promising performances after 90 days of operation: 75-85\% carbon
   removal with an organic loading rate of 15 kg(COD) m(-3) day(-1). The
   amount of biomass (in terms of attached volatile solids) was close to
   0.2 g g(-1) of solid at the end of the tests. Most particles were
   covered with a thin biofilm of uniform thickness, which was attributed
   to the friction effects due to turbulence. The performance observed
   during the start-up was similar or even higher than that of other
   previously tested fluidized bed technologies treating the same
   wastewater. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of horizontal flow on bubble size and on oxygen transfer was
   examined in a 400-L pilot of oxidation ditch. In clean water, the oxygen
   transfer was enhanced by 38\% when applying a horizontal velocity of
   0.44 m s(-1), although bubble diameter was increased by 24\%. The oxygen
   transfer increase is mainly due to the neutralisation of the liquid
   vertical circulation (spiral flows). The addition of surfactants to the
   clean water (1 mg L(-1)) did not allow to reproduce the reduction of the
   alpha factor observed on a real site when applying a horizontal flow.
   Anionic surfactants reduced the bubble size. In the presence of the
   anionic surfactant SLS, bubble diameter was identical with and without
   velocity, the alpha, factor was thus slightly increased when applying a
   horizontal flow. The addition of a non-ionic surfactant had no effect on
   bubble size. the alpha(1) factor was then identical with and without
   horizontal velocity. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work is to evaluate,. in a bubble column pilot using
   different wastewaters, the water quality correction factor alpha,
   defined as the ratio between the volumetric mass transfer coefficient
   kla(O2) in the wastewater and kla(O2) in clean water.
   The characteristic of this paper is that the volumetric mass transfer
   coefficient kla(O2) is determined using propane as a tracer gas as it is
   neither produced nor consumed in biological reactors.
   Three types of water were tested in a bubble column pilot: raw
   wastewater, the supernatant of mixed liquor from an aeration tank and
   treated water after the secondary settler. The first results show that
   the alpha factor depends on water quality and seems to be linked to
   organic carbon and surface tension.
   The separation of the parameters kl and a allowed us to understand the
   variations of the alpha factor. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Our-dimensional models of clarifiers have been studied. In these models
   clarifiers are considered as a set of layers exchanging matter from one
   to another following two ways: convection and sedimentation. The
   sedimentation flux is deduced from the sedimentation velocity. This
   velocity can be stated as a function of the suspended solids'
   concentration only. This hypothesis induces a strong underestimation of
   the sludge blanket level. This underestimation is explained because the
   sedimentation velocity does not take into account all the physics and
   hydraulics of the clarifier. A complementary hypothesis has thus been
   added to the model: the sum of convection Aux and sedimentation flux
   remains constant through all the depth of the clarifier. This hypothesis
   is modeled as a null derivative of the flux over the depth. This
   differential equation leads to a new expression of the sedimentation
   velocity. Two real cases have then been simulated using this new
   sedimentation velocity. The simulated sludge blanket evolution fitted
   the experimental data. The suspended solids residence time in the
   clarifier correlated well with an empirical relation given by the
   bibliography. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty six geographically and hydrologically diverse sediment samples
   were collected from major rivers in eastern China and analyzed for
   sediment characteristics (grain size distribution, iron, manganese and
   their oxyhydroxides, aluminum, total organic carbon, surface area and
   surface site density) and Cd, Cu, Pb and zn concentrations. The relation
   of sediment characteristics to trace metal concentrations was
   statistically studied by Kendall rank and partial rank correlation
   analysis. Although a variety of sediment characteristics showed apparent
   correlations with trace metal concentrations, most of them were caused
   by the interrelation among the characteristics themselves. The partial
   correlation analysis indicated that trace metal concentrations of the
   relatively uncontaminated sediments can be better interpreted by the
   sediment surface area (an integrated characteristic) and aluminum
   content (an indication of the local geochemical processes). (C) 1999

Abstract = {{An activated sludge treatment plant of Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy (currently
   Novartis) had difficulty meeting the effluent total suspended solids
   (TSS) permit requirement of 40 mg l(-1). The plant commonly contained
   small, weak flocs with a characteristic lack of filaments. It was
   hypothesized that optimization of the plant's bioreactor arrangement
   (i.e. the manner in which the feed was introduced into the six activated
   sludge basins connected in series) would lead to stronger activated
   sludge flocs with filamentous backbones, and that these flocs would
   provide a clearer supernatant and be less sensitive to changes in the
   wastewater composition. In order to optimize the bioreactor arrangement,
   bench-scale experiments were carried our using two model activated
   sludge systems operated simultaneously. A belter floc structure and
   consequently lower effluent TSS concentrations were achieved in the
   system in which the influent was split between basins 1 and 2 rather
   than being introduced into basin 1. Furthermore, an excess sludge
   removal strategy of controlling the MLSS concentration proved to be more
   favorable than that of maintaining a stable solids retention time (SRT).
   Through implementation of the results in the full-scale plant, the
   effluent TSS values were stabilized well below the permitted level. (C)

Abstract = {{Distribution coefficients (K-d) were measured for copper (Cu) and zinc
   (Zn) in laboratory batch experiments for 17 sandy aquifer materials at
   environmentally relevant solute concentrations (Cu: 5-300 mu g/l, Zn:
   20-3100 mu g/l). The K-d values ranged two to three orders of magnitude
   (Cu:70-10,800 1/kg; Zn: 6-22,800 l/kg) and correlating them to the
   characteristics of the aquifer material (particle size distribution,
   organic C content, surface area, pH) revealed good correlation with pH
   in the range 5.3-8.9 (Cu: r(2) = 0.72. Zn: r(2) = 0.94). Including any
   other of the measured aquifer characteristics improved the correlation
   only a few percent. The results indicate that the mobility of Cu and Zn
   in sandy aquifers, as reflected in the measured K-d values, is very
   restricted at pH values above 6, since the relative migration velocity
   is less than 1\%. However, at lower pH values, Zn seems to become mobile
   in sandy aquifers. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Alton Water, Suffolk, UK, is a linear reservoir, with input water pumped
   into the northwest end and drawoff tower in the main basin at the
   southeast end. The reservoir had an eutrophic to mesotrophic gradient in
   1995 and 1996, primarily due to differences in summer. In 1995 mean
   summer chlorophyll a concentration at the northwest end was 95 +/- 34 mu
   g l(-1), 24 times that in the main basin. Total phosphorus,
   orthophosphate, nitrate and ammonium concentrations significantly
   decreased along the length of the reservoir, whilst Secchi depth
   increased. The first two components of principal component analysis
   (PCA) explained 37.4\% of the variation in the data set, with ordination
   of sample sites along opposing gradients of TP and Secchi depth. The
   northwest end of the reservoir had high suspended solids and algal
   biomass whilst the main basin was a clear water site with high Secchi
   depth. Phosphorus was more limiting than nitrogen (DIN:OP > 16.1),
   however Si:TP fell below 16:1 during spring (March-May) and summer
   (July-September) indicating possible silica limitation to diatoms. In
   situ nutrient addition experiments (September 1996-August 1997)
   indicated phosphorus limitation, with response to phosphate addition
   significantly increasing along the length of the reservoir.
   Go-limitation did not occur as addition of phosphate, ammonium and
   silicate together produced the-same response as phosphate addition
   alone. Alkaline phosphatase activity assay supported the pattern of
   phosphorus limitation with highest activity in the main basin.
   Manipulation of zooplankton grazing did nor control the algal biomass
   response to phosphate addition. Ferric dosing of the pumped input
   coupled with the topography of the reservoir limited algal biomass in
   the main basin through bottom-up nutrient limitation (C) 2000 Elsevier

   rate (SOUR), sludge capillary suction time (CST), supernatant
   biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), supernatant chemical oxygen demand
   (COD), supernatant turbidity, sludge Roc morphology and biodiversity
   were all monitored. The reductions achieved in settled sludge volume,
   MLSS and MLVSS were higher for domestic than for pharmaceutical sludges.
   A significant improvement in domestic sludge settleability (due to a
   change in flee morphology) appeared between 14 and 21d of aerobic
   digestion, followed by an increase in supernatant turbidity and a
   decrease in sludge filterability Eventually, pH stabilisation at 6.5
   improved sludge characteristics, leading to a clearer recycled
   supernatant and a better sludge filterability. No odour or foam problems
   were recorded. The aerobic digestion performance achieved was a
   reduction of 42-53\% MLSS, 53-64\% MLVSS. 66-93\% SOUR, 53-81\% settled
   sludge volume and full stabilisation for domestic sludges: while fur
   pharmaceutical sludges reductions of 4-18\% MLSS, 6-25\% MLVSS, and
   64-79\% SOUR were achieved with full stabilisation. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A pseudo-second order rate equation describing the kinetics of sorption
   of divalent metal ions onto sphagnum moss peat at different initial
   metal ion concentrations and pear doses has been developed. The kinetics
   of sorption were followed based on the amounts of metal sorbed at
   various time intervals. Results show that sorption (chemical bonding)
   might be rate-limiting in the sorption of divalent metal ions onto peat
   during agitated batch contact time experiments. The rate constant, the
   equilibrium sorption capacity and the initial sorption rate were
   calculated. From these parameters, an empirical model for predicting the
   sorption capacity of metal ions sorbed was derived. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{34}},

Pages = {{743-750}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this study the natural disinfection effects of marine environment
   on;wastewater without the process of chlorination before being
   discharged into the ocean through submarine outfall pipes were
   investigated. The effects of four natural factors, including light
   intensity, salinity, volumetric mixing ratio of seawater to wastewater
   and the existence of predators, to the disinfection of wastewater in
   marine environment were examined. Under the condition that with or
   without the existence of predatory microorganisms in wastewater,
   experiments are performed based on rotatable central composite designs
   with different factor level combinations of the three factors mentioned
   above. Under each factor level combinations, the numbers of E. coli are
   measured at the beginning of each experiment and every half hour later
   on for two hours. Then through statistical analysis, it was found that
   both light intensity and salinity have significant effects to the
   die-off rate constant with or without the existence of predators. The
   effects of the three environment factors can explain a larger portion
   (about 90\%) of the variations exhibiting in the estimated die-off rate
   constants in the case of without the existence of predators than that
   (about 50\%) for the case with the existence of predators, which
   indicates that there may be random effects of predatory microorganisms
   in wastewater causing more variations in the die-off rate constants.
   Furthermore, through paired t-test, it also indicates that the die-off
   rate constants for with the existence of predators is significantly
   larger than that for without the existence of predators. Finally, for
   the primarily treated sewage from Kaohsiung, Taiwan, by natural
   disinfection it is estimated that it takes about 100 min during the
   daytime and 196 min during the nighttime to reach the national guideline
   concentration of E. coli (1000 cfu/100 ml) of Taiwan in marine
   environment. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The removal of heavy metals from anaerobically digested sewage sludge
   was studied by using ferric sulfate. The addition of ferric sulfate to
   the sludge caused the acidification of the sludge and the elution of
   heavy metals from the sludge. The pH of the sludge decreased with an
   increase in the amount of iron added and with a decrease in the sludge
   concentration. At a sludge solid concentration of 2\% (w/w), the sludge
   pH dropped below 3 and the elution percentage of cadmium, copper and
   zinc was more than 80\% when the added amount of ferric iron was more
   than 1.5g per L of wet sludge. Furthermore, the method using ferric
   sulfate was compared with that using sulfuric acid at pH 3 in order to
   clarify the effect of ferric iron as an oxidation reagent on elution of
   heavy metals. Ferric iron eluted cadmium, copper and zinc more
   effectively than sulfuric acid. This effective elution of heavy metals
   was caused by the oxidation of the sludge solid by ferric iron added.
   From these results, it was concluded that ferric iron played a role to
   acidify the sludge and to oxidize metallic compounds in the sludge and
   this new chemical method was useful for the removal of heavy metals from
   anaerobically digested sewage sludge. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The standard method for the enumeration of somatic coliphages in water
   proposed by the American Public Health Association recommends the use of
   single layer plaque assays with 5 ml sample and the direct use of frozen
   and thawed host E. coli cultures. In assays of spiked river water the
   efficiency of plating (e.o.p.) of the standard method, using
   frozen/thawed host cultures, was significantly lower than comparable
   assays using unfrozen host cultures. Frozen/thawed cultures also
   produced significantly lower efficiency of plating in scaled up versions
   of the standard method using both 50 and 100 ml sample. The e.o.p.
   varied from 39.0-46.1\% with frozen/thawed cultures and 67.7-74.4\% with
   unfrozen cultures at OD 0.5, relative to overnight cultures. It is
   therefore recommended that overnight cultures are used in place of
   frozen/thawed cultures in the APHA standard method and scaled up
   versions of it. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study was to investigate the ozone oxidation of textile wastewaters
   in a fluidized or fixed granular activated carbon (GAC) bed. Experiments
   were conducted to examine the effects of various operating variables on
   the treatment efficienies of the combined ozonation and activated carbon
   adsorption. Ozonation was found to provide very efficient regeneration
   of exhausted GAC in the reactor, avoiding the costly ex situ GAC
   regeneration. It was also observed that the GAC acts not only as an
   adsorbent, but also as a catalyst in promoting ozone oxidation. The
   combined ozonation and GAC adsorption offers strong synergistic effects
   on the textile wastewater treatment. A generalized kinetic model
   consisting of multiple steps of ozonation and adsorption was proposed in
   this work to represent the combined process. The proposed
   adsorption/ozonation/desorption mechanism and the generalized kinetic
   model were shown to describe very well the combined treatment process.

Abstract = {{Coal-tar was commonly used as an internal lining for corrosion
   protection of water pipes from the 19th century. In this project the
   principal mechanisms leading to the occurrence of Polycyclic Aromatic
   Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in those water mains were investigated.
   The results showed that the occurrence of PAHs in a distribution system
   was linked to the presence of the disinfectants chlorine and chlorine
   dioxide. In laboratory experiments it was demonstrated that the coal-tar
   surface represents a substrate for the growth of biofilms which exhibits
   protective effects. Generally. hostile environmental conditions for
   microbiological activity of the biofilm such as disinfection, stagnation
   periods and anaerobic conditions could be identified as important
   Factors which favour the occurrence of PAHs in drinking water.
   Immediately after stagnation periods an increase of PAH concentrations
   was observed. Furthermore, it was clearly shown that disturbances in the
   hydraulic regime such as water hammers, operation of valves and rapid
   increases in flow velocity can result in enhanced PAH concentrations by
   the destabilisation of the biofilm matrix or high sheer forces affecting
   the pipe walls resulting in the release of particles highly contaminated
   with PAHs which may be responsible for the contamination of the drinking
   water. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Concern over nutrient levels and eutrophication in the north-east
   Atlantic sea area has required a reduction in inputs at several urban
   centres. Implementation of a best European Practice by the States of
   Jersey has necessitated an assessment of the impact of the Islands waste
   water treatment works (WwTW) on inorganic nutrient inputs to the coastal
   zone. Inorganic nutrient concentrations in stream and sewage effluent
   Inputs into St. Aubin's Bay Jersey, were monitored during the
   phytoplankton growing season. Inorganic nutrient input budgets were
   calculated using estimates of runoff based on hydrological data for an
   instrumented catchment. Results indicated that the WwTW accounted for
   54\% of the inorganic nitrogen load and 98\% of the inorganic phosphorus
   load over the survey period. The remaining inputs from catchments are
   driven by the seasonality of flow and nutrient concentrations.
   Installation of nutrient removal technology at the WwTW would reduce the
   total inorganic nitrogen load by 33\% and the inorganic phosphorus load
   by 86\%. Implications for the WwTW and compliance with the European
   urban waste water treatment Directive 91/271/EEC are discussed, (C) 2000

Pages = {{797-806}},

Abstract = {{The growth of sulphate reducing bacteria in copper sulphate solutions
   and their efficacy of removal of copper from those solutions was
   investigated. The direct role of the bacteria in facilitating copper
   removal was identified by (i) comparing copper precipitation kinetics in
   the presence and absence of the bacteria cells and (ii) by observing the
   morphology and location of the copper precipitates. Copper was removed
   effectively by SRB to less than 0.1 mg l(-1) from sulphate solutions
   containing 150 mg l(-1) or less initial copper concentration. Below 50
   mg l(-1) initial concentration of copper, little inhibition of sulphate
   reduction was observed in the five day batch tests. Copper was seen to
   precipitate out more quickly in the presence of bacteria cells than
   without bacteria cells, sulphide not limiting. Thus, association of
   copper with the bacteria cells could promote precipitation rate. Visual
   observations of the solids indicated dense packing and good settling.
   Well contrasted images of the unstained bacteria confirmed that the
   minerals formed were associated with the cell surface. Cells showed a
   high degree of capsule production in the presence of copper in solution.
   This phenomena is the most likely reason for the formation of
   flocculates, fast settling and the dense appearance of the precipitates.

Abstract = {{A set of quantitative analytical data from the alluvial aquifer of the
   Pisuerga river, located at the north-east of Valladolid (Spain), has
   been processed by multivariate statistical techniques in order to
   investigate the evolution of the groundwater composition between two
   surveys. The original matrix consisted of 16 physico-chemical variables,
   determined in 32 groundwater samples collected in 32 sampling sites of
   the aquifer. The surveys were carried out in October 1994, at the end of
   the irrigation and low water period just before autumn rains, and in
   April-May 1995 at the beginning of the irrigation and high water period
   and after the recharge of aquifer. The experimental 64 x 16 matrix was
   analysed by Principal Component Analysis(PCA), and the resulting
   Principal Components (PCs) and Varimax rotated PCs (VFs) analysed by
   means of box and bivariate plots. The exploration of the correlation
   matrix allowed to uncover strong associations between some variables
   (sulphate, chloride, hydrogencarbonate, sodium, potassium, magnesium,
   calcium and electrical conductivity) as well as a lack of association
   between the others (pH, nitrate, and trace metals). PCA showed the
   existence of up to five significant PCs which account for 71.39\% of the
   variance. Two of them call be initially assigned to `mineralization'
   whereas the other PCs are built from variables indicative of pollution.
   Box and bivariate plots of the two first PCs showed that
   `mineralization' is maintained through surveys and that trace elements
   increase from the first to the second survey in all zones, as a possible
   consequence of soil leaching caused by the rise of the groundwater
   level. Varimax rotation allowed to `break up' the `mineralization' PC
   into two VFs, assigned respectively to `natural' mineralization and to
   `saline' manmade contamination (sodium and chloride). Box and bivariate
   plots of VFs confirmed the existence of a differential `natural'
   mineralization pattern, now ascribed exclusively to dissolution of
   geological materials, as well as the presence of a zone with unusually
   high levels of `saline' contamination attributed to leakages from
   sanitary systems. The plot of VFs also allowed to visualise seasonal
   variations, identifying a process of dilution of the `natural'
   mineralization during the recharge of the aquifer, and an increase of
   the `saline' contamination, assigned to a variety of non-natural causes,

Abstract = {{Dissolved air flotation (DAF) is currently being received in much
   attention as an effective process for solid-liquid separation in water
   technology. In this study, we scaled-up the DAF plant from a pilot-scale
   (72 m(3)/day) to a full-scale (6000 m(3)/day) plant and the sand-float
   type DAF was used. The concept of maintaining equal surface loading rate
   into scaling-up of DAF was a proper practice and strategy. In order to
   optimize the DAF plant, it was needed to determine the surface loading
   rare and air dissolving tube pressure. The optimum conditions of surface
   loading rate and air dissolving tube pressure were indicated in 7.5
   m(3)/m(2) day and 440 kPa from the pilot plant, respectively. The
   removal efficiency for TOC and UV254 from the full-scale plant was as
   satisfactory as those from the pilot plant for the same surface loading
   rates. However, especially in flotation zone, the full-scale plant
   performed a little bit poorer than the pilot-scale plant in turbidity
   and chlorophyll-a reduction: because hull-scale plant had long retention
   time and turbulent mixing condition during backwashing time which might
   be brought about the breakage of fragile flocs.
   Performance comparisons between the full-scale DAF plant and the
   conventional plant located at the city of Nam-Yang Ju in Korea are
   presented. DAF process showed higher efficiency than the conventional
   settling system improving the water quality in general, namely,
   turbidity, TOC, UV254, Fe and Mn. We, therefore, conclude that DAF
   system should have substantial advantages over the conventional settling
   process in drinking water treatment. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The objectives of this work were to investigate a conceptual layout for
   an inexpensive and simple system that would treat primary municipal
   wastewater to discharge standards. Furthermore, the system may provide
   an increased supply of safe water for irrigation with low operational
   costs and produce commercially valuable plants for small communities in
   arid and semi-arid areas. A commercial hydroponic system was adapted for
   this study and consisted of five gullies, 3 m long by 100 mm wide.
   Primary treated effluent was used to irrigate lettuce in one series and
   a commercial nutrient solution was used to irrigate the same type of
   lettuce in another series as a control, both by nutrient film technique
   (NFT). Nutrient and suspended solids were efficiently removed by the NFT
   plant system. While no uptake of F-RNA bacteriophages were detected
   within lettuce leaves, uptake was apparent from spiked virus-sized
   particles (fluorescent 0.1 mu m microspheres) and equivocal from spores
   of the faecal bacterium, Clostridium perfringens. Microbial data was
   used in a beta-Poisson dose response model and indicated that the
   probability of infection for a single ingestion event of NFT grown
   lettuce grown on primary treated municipal effluent was about 1.7\% for
   viruses. Moreover, plants accumulated heavy metals in leaf tissues at
   concentrations higher than the maximum recommended levels for Australian
   and New Zealand food (As = 6.5, Cd = 3.8, Pb = 20 mg kg(-1)). Hence, it
   is recommended to evaluate ornamental or non-edible crops, such as
   essential oils, pyrethrum or flowers for sewage treatment. A conceptual
   layout for a full-scale production treatment hydroponic Farm (PTHF) for
   small communities was based on modelling phosphorus removal with the
   hydroponic NFT experimental pilot plant. With NFT culture of lettuces,
   roots and other surfaces accounted for 67-72\% of total phosphorous (TP)
   removal (by adsorption mechanisms). Based on empirical modelling, an
   influent TP 2-6 mg l(-1) PTHF would be expected to be economical for
   small communities (<400 people) and produce effluent with TP <0.15 mg
   l(-1), SS <2.5 mg l(-1) and BOD <55 mg l(-1). Lower values would be
   expected if the effluent was polished through a humus filter. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The industrial solvents tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene
   (TCE) are among the most ubiquitous chlorinated compounds found in
   groundwater contamination. The objective of this study was ro evaluate
   the potential installation a peal biobarrier to clean up aquifers
   contaminated by PCE/TCE. Peal bioavailability was evaluated using a
   modified biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) test. Results show that
   biodegradable materials were released from pear and utilized by
   microbial consortia contained in the activated sludge. Degradation of
   the released organic materials caused the oxygen consumption and a
   slight decrease in chemical oxygen demand (COD) measurements. Based on
   the COD tests, 0.5 g of peat released approximately 6 mg of GOD, which
   has the potential to convert 1.5 mg of PCE to ethylene (ETH). Microcosms
   inoculated with aquifer sediments or activated sludges were constructed
   under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Results indicate that pear
   can serve as the diffusion source of primary substrates, and enhance the
   PCE and TCE biodegradation under aerobic cometabolism and reductive
   dechlorination processes, respectively. Compared to the microcosms with
   aquifer sediments as the inocula, microcosms inoculated with sludges
   showed higher TCE/PCE degradation ratios (0.277 mu M/day for TCE removal
   and 0.419 mu M/day for PCE removal under aerobic and anaerobic
   conditions, respectively), and an immediate PCE/TCE decrease. These
   findings make the peat biobarrier containing sludge inocula more
   feasible and applicable from an engineering point of view. Results from
   the feasibility study show that the proposed pear biobarrier has the
   potential to become an environmentally and economically acceptable
   technology for the bioremediation of chlorinated-solvent contaminated
   groundwater. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study the following was evaluated: (a) application of a complex
   activated sludge model on a full-scale plans (Phostrip(kappa)-like
   process), (b) influent and sludge characterization procedures for bio-P
   modeling, (c) the use of batch tests for model evaluation and (d)
   different alternative BPR process configurations (A/O, UCT and
   BCFSkappa). An integrated model for aerobic and denitrifying biological
   phosphorus removal (Delft bio-P model) replaced the module for P removal
   of ASM No. 2 and was combined with retained equations for COD and N
   conversion of the ASM No 2. This combined model proved well capable of
   describing the wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) Haarlem Waarderpolder
   with adjustment of only three (out of the sixty) default parameters.
   Some of batch tests were satisfactorily described by the model too.
   Batch tests proved as a useful tool for sludge characterization and
   model validation. The standard Dutch procedure for influent and sludge
   characterization proved satisfactory for the model construction.
   Modeling of alternative BPR process configuration showed that good P
   removal was achieved by all three alternative process configurations, by
   the latest one with comparatively lowest construction and operational
   costs (lower building costs and no acetate addition). Valuable
   experience from practical application of the model was obtained; study
   indicated where the model should be improved; the plant operation and
   treatment processes were better understood and plant performance was
   further optimized. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The attempt to restore the highly eutrophic Lake Arendsee (Germany) by
   means of artificial resuspension of calcareous mud (Seekreide) and
   capping of the natural bottom sediments in 1995 did not show the
   expected effects of decreasing the phosphorus (P) content in the water
   body. To understand this, the sorption characteristics and the
   mechanisms of P uptake of Seekreide were studied with laboratory
   experiments. These experimental results were combined with model
   simulations at field conditions to evaluate the efficiency of Seekreide
   for controlling the P cycle in the lake. The littoral deposits of
   Seekreide in Lake Arendsee mainly consist of calcite (70-87\% dw) and
   are characterised by low contents of organic matter (5-8\% dw), total P
   (0.13-0.47 mg g(-1) dw) and iron (3.2-3.8 mg g(-1) dw). Phosphorus
   uptake under laboratory conditions could be described with Langmuir
   sorption isotherms. A substantial portion of this uptake was not due to
   sorption to the CaCO3 surfaces but to iron oxihydroxides, since most P
   was found in the reductant-soluble fraction (BD-P). Although the
   theoretical maximum of sorbed P ranged between 0.19 and 0.22 mg g(-1)
   dw, no substantial P uptake occurred under held conditions. The model
   predicted that resuspension of about 25,000 tons of littoral sediment
   would transiently remove not more than 0.3 tons of P from the water
   column (1.3\% of TPtake) during sedimentation. After deposition of
   resuspended Seekreide, anaerobic conditions prevented any additional P
   retention. The close agreement of laboratory based simulations with
   field observations indicates: (1) capping of the lake sediments did not
   significantly prevent P-release, and, therefore (2) the -negligible-
   total effect of the large scale treatment and the failure to decrease P
   concentration in Lake Arendsee may be explained by and predictable from
   P uptake experiments, only (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of solution pH and temperature on the rate of inactivation of
   Iowa strain Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) oocysts with chlorine
   dioxide was determined. Oocyst viability was assessed with a modified in
   vitro excystation method consistent with animal infectivity data.
   Inactivation curves were characterized by a lag phase followed by
   Chick-Watson first order kinetics. The rate of inactivation was
   essentially the same at pH 6 and 8. CT requirements at pH 10 were
   approximately 20-30\% lower than those at pH 6-8. The magnitude of the
   lag phase and the inactivation rate constant were both found to ubey
   Arrhenius law for the experimental temperature ranee of 4-30 degrees C.
   CT requirements for C. parvum oocyst inactivation were found to increase
   by an average factor of approximately 3.4 for every 10 degrees C
   decrease in temperature. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Egression of flies from sewage filter-beds}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{877-889}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Fly species that inhabit sewage filter-beds can be a public nuisance and
   have to be controlled. Chemical and bacteriological agents used
   currently for such control are washed rapidly from the beds, so, if
   these agents are to be used efficiency, they should be applied only when
   an emergence of adults abundant enough to cause a nuisance is expected.
   The present study examined the phenology of some fly species emanating
   from filter-beds in ten sewage works across a broad latitudinal range
   (51.13 degrees N-57.17 degrees N) in Britain, to establish whether
   environmental temperature alone could be used to predict fly egression
   patterns. Four species were widespread and abundant: the psychodids
   Psychoda albipennis (=P.severini ) and P. alternata, and the chironomids
   Limnophyes minimus and Metriocnemus eurynotus (=M.hygropetricus).
   Average air temperature was a major environmental variable determining
   the phenology of these four species. When the observed polyvoltine
   patterns of egression were compared with predicted patterns based on
   generation time/temperature relationships, they were similar. A poorer
   match was obtained when the temperature of the settled sewage was used.
   Although the air temperature regime could be used to predict when the
   adults of a generation were likely to emerge from the beds, its
   relationship with the relative abundance of the various generations was
   less precise; other environmental variables were clearly also
   significant. It is concluded that larval populations have to be
   monitored if egression abundance is to be forecast accurately. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{We investigated the existence of carcinogenic heterocyclic amines in
   water samples from a river near Kyoto where several sewage-treatment
   plants discharge their effluents and water purification plants
   downstream use this polluted water as their source. Trp-P-2 is one of
   the carcinogenic heterocyclic amines included in charred meat and is
   often excreted in human waste in genotoxic fractions. We analysed
   Trp-P-2 by reverse-phase HPLC using an ODS column and the UV spectrum.
   Genotoxic potent activities for blue-rayon extracts of river water were
   detected in the samples at sampling locations. We identified Trp-P-2 in
   a genotoxic fraction by MS analysis. The concentrations of Trp-P-2 were
   calculated in the order of 10(-6) mg l(-1). These results indicated the
   existence of carcinogenic heterocyclic amines in the river water. The
   authors concluded that these carcinogens derive from the effluent of
   sewage treatment plants including human waste. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The photo-Fenton process using potassium ferrioxalate as a mediator in
   the photodegradation reaction of organochloride compounds in an aqueous
   medium was investigated. The influence of parameters such as hydrogen
   peroxide and ferrioxalate concentrations and initial pH, was evaluated
   using dichloroacetic acid (DCA) as a model compound under black-light
   lamp irradiation. An upflow annular photoreactor, operating in a single
   pass or recirculating mode was used during photodegradation experiments
   with artificial light. The extent of the release of chloride ions was
   used to evaluate the photodegradation reaction. The optimum pH range
   observed was 2.5-2.8. The efficiency of DCA dechlorination increased
   with increasing concentrations of H2O2 and potassium ferrioxalate.
   reaching a plateau after the addition of 6 and 1.5 mmol/L of those
   reagents, respectively, The total organic carbon (TOC) content in DCA
   and 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP) solutions was compared with the chloride
   released after photodegradation. The influence of natural solar light
   intensity, measured at 365 nm, was evaluated for the dechlorination of
   DCA on typical summer's days showing a linear dependency. The
   photodegradation of DCA using black-light lamp and solar irradiation was
   compared. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ozone mass transfer in water and wastewater was studied by using a 2D
   laser particle dynamics analyzer (PDA) to simultaneously measure bubble
   size distribution and mixing intensity. Three types of water samples,
   including deionized water, tap water and pulp mill effluents were tested
   to demonstrate the enhancement of ozone absorption with the presence of
   chemical reactions. Bubble size distribution and apparent mass transfer
   rates were used to estimate individual mass transfer parameters and
   examine the effects of operating conditions and selected gas spargers.
   II was shown that gas bubbles in ozonation systems varied over a broad
   range of sizes and their distributions usually deviated From a simple
   normal distribution. Among the factors examined, the gas sparger and
   water types were identified as the most important factors affecting mean
   bubble size, whereas the impacts of ozone dose and gas flow rate on
   bubble size distribution were minor. Due to the higher gas holdup,
   however, the specific surface area was strongly dependent on the gas Row
   rare as well. Consequently, the mass transfer coefficient increased as
   the gas flow rate increased. A further enhancement of mass transfer was
   observed for pulp mill wastewarers as compared to tap and deionized
   water samples, because the occurrence of chemical reactions depleted the
   dissolved ozone within the gas-liquid film. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

   reactive phosphorus loadings have increased by approximately 2.0 tonnes
   SRP yr(-1) so that between 1974 and 1997 the mean concentration of the
   inflow has increased from 15 to 33 mu g SRP 1(-1). The increase is
   probably caused by diffuse agricultural sources. There is no temporal

   stations in Delft were in the highly polluted classes 3 and 4,
   necessitating sediment dredging followed by disposal under strict
   conditions. In contrast, only 33\% of the sediment samples in the Delft
   outer city fell into these pollution classes. Factor analysis showed
   that the inner and outer city sediments cold be divided into two
   different clusters, each with their own characteristics. The chemical
   components mainly responsible for the sediment pollution were Cu, Zn,
   DDT, PAHs and Pb. For the latter two parameters, this points to
   traffic-reslated pollution lands whereas the main sources of copper and
   zinc are probably related to the corrosion of metal structures. Mass
   balance calculations for the Delft inner city canal system show that, of
   the accumulated heavy metals, around 65\% of Zn and Pb and even 85\% of
   Cu originate from outside the Delft inner city, viz. via open inlets
   with the main Rijn-Schie canal. In view of the decreasing contents in
   the sediment top layer, it is anticipated that, with the various
   pollution abatement measures bring taken, a gradual improvement of the
   Delft canal sediment quality will take place. (C) 2000 Published by

Abstract = {{The need for readily biodegradable organic matter to support
   denitrification and enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) can be
   satisfied using external or internal carbon sources. This paper examines
   the production and removal of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), mainly acetic
   acid, and other hydrolyzed products from sludge using hydrothermal
   treatment at subcritical (<374 degrees C) and supercritical (>374
   degrees C) temperatures. Subcritical water oxidation (SubCWO) achieved
   effective hydrolysis (> 95\% as GOD) of the sludge organic solids but
   incomplete oxidation (< 95\% as GOD) of the organic component of sludge.
   SubCWO also produced GOD-rich liquors, which contained as much as 30\%
   wt/wt hydrolyzed GOD, including 10\% wt/wt acetate. The contribution of
   acetate to COD in the liquor increased as treatment progressed,
   accounting for as much as 80\% of the soluble COD when the oxidation
   efficiency exceeded 80\%. While SubCWO resulted in partial COD removal,
   complete oxidation (>99\% as GOD) of the organic component of sludge,
   including oxidation of hydrolysis products, was achieved using
   supercritical water oxidation (SCWO). Accordingly, hydrothermal
   treatment using SubCWO and SCWO can provide a useful sludge management
   option, combining sludge mass and volume reduction with the production
   of useful organic matter to support biological nutrient removal. (C)

   TiO(2) as complexed intermediates. Continued PCQ saw reappearance of the
   lead in solution, primarily as Pb(2+). Stoichiometric Pb-EDTA studies
   showed rd no noticeable pH effects even though Pb-EDTA adsorption
   depends strongly on pH. This suggests that initial complex;adsorption is
   not required for its destruction and th;lt Pb-EDTA photocatalysis occurs
   both at the TiO(2) surface and in thr aqueous phase. Production of CO(2)
   and formaldehyde during photocatalysis suggests initial attack at an

   intermediates. Nitrogen-containing products were ammonium and nitrate.
   Fur EDTA, Pb(II) studies, smaller amounts of CO(2) compared with

Abstract = {{The feasibility of using an internally available carbon source for
   biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal was investigated. A new
   integrated animal wastewater treatment process consisting of two
   reactors was operated with various sequences for the treatment of high
   strength piggery manure. The treatment process was operated with
   real-time control technology, which utilized the oxidation-reduction
   potential (ORP). In the first operation, the sludge in each reactor was
   completely separated (sludge separation strategy, SSS), while a portion
   of the sludge in the first reactor was added into the second reactor in
   every cycle of the second operational strategy (sludge addition
   strategy, SAS). None of the operating strategies used a supplemental
   carbon source to achieve enhanced phosphorus release and
   denitrification. By achieving successful real-time control, very high
   removal efficiencies of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus were
   obtained in both operations. These high performances were mainly
   achieved by means of biological mechanisms, not chemical and physical
   processes. The real-rime control made it possible to utilize an
   internally available organic material for phosphorus removal and
   denitrification of produced NOx-N, without any external carbon sourer.
   Furthermore, it was found that an optimization of aeration periods could
   be achieved by using the tested real-time control technology, since the
   technology stopped the aeration when the targeted oxidation status
   occurred in treatment system. The HRT obtained in both the SSS and the
   SAS was proportional to the FM ratio. Experimental data showed that the
   sludge addition strategy(SAS) has a practical advantage over the sludge
   separation strategy (SSS), in that the SAS enhanced the denitrification
   and resulted in constant and low effluent NOx-N concentrations. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The decolorization of methyl orange by ozone is effectively carried out
   in this study. Factors affecting the decolorization rate of methyl
   orange are investigated by a 2(5-1) fractional factorial design method.
   The influences of the main factor and two-factor interaction effects of
   the operating variables of pH, reaction temperature, agitation rate and
   concentrations of methyl orange and ozone stream on decolorization are
   established. The results show that the effect of concentration of ozone
   stream is the most important among the five main factor effects.
   interaction between temperature and ozone stream concentration is the
   most significant effect among the ten two-factor interaction effects. A
   quadratic form fit using a modified central composite experimental
   design is obtained, and it is proved to be adequate for this system
   according to the multiple correlation coefficient and variance analysis.

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to collect information on the behavior of
   Listeria spp. in estuarine water and seawater. Listeria innocua was
   inoculated in water microcosms, in parallel with Salmonella panama, with
   the aim to obtain comparative data with this more well-known pathogen.
   In every situation L. innocua exhibited a more rapid die-off than S.
   panama, with decimal reduction times always shorter than those observed
   for S. panama. For both bacterial strains the decimal reduction times
   were shorter in seawater than in estuarine water and shorter at 18
   degrees C than at 5 degrees C. In seawater, as in estuarine water,
   bacterial die-off was more rapid in natural water than in sterilized
   water. These data obtained from a conventional approach, on culturable
   bacteria show the high sensitivity of listeria in water. However, the
   survival is long enough for bioaccumulation by shellfish in polluted
   coastal waters. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrate ((NO3-) contamination of groundwater is a major concern
   throughout intensive agricultural areas (nonpoint source pollution).
   Current processes (e.g., ion exchange, membrane separation) are not
   selective for NO3- removal. The objective of this study was to develop a
   catalytic reduction process to selectively remove NO3- from groundwater
   associated with agricultural community. Three catalysts, palladium (Pd),
   platinum (Pt), and rhodium (Rh) on carbon (5-10\%) were tested in this
   study. A 1 of groundwater sample was amended with 0.5 g catalyst and
   reacted at different redox potentials (340 to -400 mV) and reaction
   times (1-6 h). During the catalytic reduction process the pH was
   maintained around 6.5 by bubbling 5\% carbon dioxide (CO2). At a given
   redox potential and reaction period, samples were analyzed for NO3- and
   NO2- (nitrite) with ion chromatography (IC). Initial NO3- concentrations
   ranged between 32 and 41 mg/l. Among the three catalysts, Rh was most
   effective in removing NO3- Results suggest that Ph catalyst at --400mV
   and 6 h reaction time can decrease NO3- concentration from 40 to 11.9
   mg/l. During the NO3- reduction process NO2- was not detected. The
   re-oxidation of formerly reduced samples to 390 mV resulted in no
   increase in the concentration of NO3-. Application of a small flow of
   current to the catalytic reduction process increased NO3- reduction
   rates significantly. For instance, application of 4.6-6.1 v to -250 mV
   and 6 h of reaction time decreased NO, concentration from 40 to 7.9
   mg/l. The catalytic reduction process described in this study is useful
   in removing NO3- from groundwater associated with nonpoint source
   pollution. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of chlorination on the formation of organohalogenated
   compounds in drinking waters from both treated surface and ground waters
   have been investigated. In this extensive study, the levels of these
   chemicals found at the outlets of major waterworks and the increment due
   to disinfection treatments have been evaluated. Thus, current drinking
   water standards and the compliance for utilities throughout the European
   Union have been analysed. The results showed that the most abundant
   organohalogenated compounds present in treated drinking waters were
   trihalomethanes with noticeable higher levels associated to treated
   surface waters. The range of concentrations for these chemicals was
   explained by the different treatment conditions. However, the study
   determined that current levels of organohalogenated compounds in
   chlorinated drinking waters are actually below established guideline
   values. Furthermore. a decrease in the concentrations of the
   organohalogenated compounds formed during the chlorination stage is
   noticeable. Optimization of the treatment processes, water resource
   protection and control of drinking water distribution seems to be the
   best preventive approach to reduce organohalogenated compounds
   formation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Infiltration into soil of contaminants present in cattle slurry was
   studied. Column experiments were performed in order to characterize the
   release of contaminants at the slurry-soil interface after surface
   application of slurry, with subsequent rainfall or irrigation. A gradual
   decrease of contaminant concentrations was observed at this interface.
   The shape of the release curves suggests that the release of substances
   from slurry can be modelled by a single-parameter release function
   derived from the Lapidus and Amundson solution of the
   convection-dispersion equation (CDE). The release process is mainly
   controlled by physical properties of the slurry, the soil, and their
   interface, on which water flow during infiltration depends. The spatial
   and temporal heterogeneity of water flow across the slurry-soil
   interface are the major causes of the observed variations in the release
   process between column replicates. However, good predictions of
   breakthrough curves (BTCs) were obtained using the release data as input
   for simulation of solute transport through the column. The shape of the
   release curve was best fitted by the release function. We compared
   prediction of solute transport (a) with input defined by the release
   function and (b) assuming rectangular-pulse input. The results show that
   the parameter space (soil Peclet number, release number) can be divided
   into two regions, one in which the assumption of rectangular pulse gives
   acceptable prediction of the transport through the column, and another
   in which this assumption is invalid. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Surfactant selection is critical to successful implementation of
   surfactant-enhanced subsurface remediation. Previous research
   demonstrated the favorable characteristics of commercial grade DOWFAX
   surfactants for enhancing contaminant solubilization. In this research
   we studied the effectiveness of higher purity DOWFAX components for
   enhancing containment solubilization. The DOWFAX surfactant components
   are mono- and di-alkylated diphenyloxide disulfonates and mono and
   di-sulfonated alkyl diphenyloxides. Surfactant solubilization of
   phenanthrene increased as the surfactant hydrophobicity increased
   (increasing alkyl chain length and with dialkylation for a given chain
   length) and as the surfactant hydrophilicity decreased (mono- versus
   di-sulfonate). Surfactant sorption likewise increased with increasing
   surfactant hydrophobicity and for monosulfonates versus disulfonates.
   Surfactant sorption was reduced by a factor of 2.5 for the higher purity
   C-16 MADS component versus commercial grade DOWFAX 8390 (which is a
   mixture of C16-MADS and DADS). in soil-contaminant systems
   surfactant-enhanced solubilization was observed to increase dramatically
   for DOWFAX components with higher solubilization potential and was not
   significantly impacted by surfactant-media sorption (reflecting the low
   sorption potential of these surfactants). These results thus further our
   understanding of how the DOWFAX components, and mixtures thereof impact
   surfactant-enhanced soil remediation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The influence of temperature on the oxygen transfer rate (OTR) was
   studied in a bubble column. Aeration took place in three different
   liquids: tapwater, anaerobically pretreated paper process water and
   thermophilic sludge grown on a mineral medium and volatile fatty acids
   as carbon source. The OTR was measured in a temperature range of 20-55
   degrees C in case of tap and process water. The OTR in the thermophilic
   sludge was determined at 55 degrees C. The OTR remained constant over
   the specified temperature range in case of tapwater and showed a slight
   increase in case of process water; The constant OTR in case of tapwater
   was due to the counteracting effect of an increased overall oxygen
   transfer coefficient versus the decreased oxygen saturation
   concentration at higher temperatures. At 55 degrees C the OTR in the
   thermophilic sludge was comparable to both other liquids at this
   temperature. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The hydraulic internal behavior of a deep wastewater stabilization pond
   fed at 3.5 m depth is studied. The lagoon is situated in the Region of
   Murcia (Southeast Spain) and this behavior was studied before by the
   authors when wastewater entered at surface level {[}Torres J. J., Soler
   A., Saez J. and Ortuno J. F. (1997a). Hydraulic performance of a deep
   wastewater stabilization pond. Water Res. 31(4). 679-688.] The tracer
   used in this experiment was sulforhodamine B.
   Two experiments were carried out, one in winter and the other in summer.
   In both cases it was found that since the sewage water temperature was
   higher than that of the water of the deepest part of the lagoon, an
   active thermal current was formed which rapidly transported the feed to
   the surface. On account of this, the phenomenon is very similar to that
   in the case of the surface feed. The active zone of the system is
   located from surface to Im depth and behaves like a constant stirred
   tank reactor (CSTR). The average winter and summer volumes of this
   active layer have been estimated. It has also been observed that the
   short-circuits have been minimal. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Chitosan, an acetylated derivative of chitin, is a biodegradable
   cationic polymer. Chitosan can be a promising substitute for alum in the
   coagulation process, because of its potential feasibility in coagulation
   without posing any health threat as the residual aluminium and other
   synthetic polymers do. In this study, various pretreatment conditions
   were tested in search of the optimum chitosan modification. Batch tests
   with synthetic source water suggest that the optimal pretreatment
   condition to prepare modified chitosan coagulant is deacetylation by
   45\% alkali solution for 60 min, followed by dissolution in 0.1\%
   hydrochloric acid. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A process to concentrate viruses from water associated with a rapid and
   sensitive viral assay was evaluated with water samples experimentally
   seeded with a single virus or a virus mixture {[}poliovirus, rotavirus,
   hepatitis A virus (HAV)]. Tangential ultrafiltration was used for virus
   concentration. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was
   tested for virus detection and its sensitivity compared to that of cell
   culture. We recovered the three viruses from experimentally contaminated
   samples, and detected viral infectivity or RNA with low inputs: 1 TCID50
   L-1 for cell culture vs 10(-3) TCID50 L-1 with the RT-PCR assay in the
   case of poliovirus, 1 TCID50 L-1 in the case of rotavirus whatever the
   technique, and RT-PCR allowed detection of HAV RNA till at least 1
   TCID50 L-1. Ninety tapwater samples were also tested for the presence of
   enterovirus and rotavirus. Five tapwater samples were positive for the
   RT-PCR assay only: one for poliovirus and four for rotavirus. This
   procedure allows a control of the virological quality of water. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{This work presents a mini-review of the various theories in previous
   literature while considering the transport processes in filter cakes
   during filtration and consolidation. The development of the conventional
   two-resistance theory (referred to herein as conventional theory) is
   initially discussed based on different types of power-law constitutive
   equations. Multi-phase theory is then described, along with the
   criticisms raised by Willis el al. over the past two decades. Also
   discussed herein is the validity of some frequently adopted assumptions
   in filtration studies. Implications of the filtration/consolidation
   theory to sludge dewatering are finally made. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Research in the field of Dissolved Air Flotation calls for studies on
   the fluid dynamics of the process for optimisation. This study describes
   a method using an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter for measuring local water
   velocities in a DAF pilot plant, and presents the results from
   measurements done in the separation zone. A test of the ADV in bubbly
   water indicates a 50\% reduction of the measured velocity in water
   containing higher concentrations of micro-bubbles. The bubble content
   and the hydraulic loading were shown to significantly influence the flow
   pattern at surface loading in the range 10-20 m/h. Micro-bubbles
   generated density gradients in the flotation tank and two major flow
   patterns were observed. Stratified how was characterised by a horizontal
   flow in a bubbly upper layer and a plug-like flow in the bubble-free
   lower layer. The break-through dow was seen to short-circuit the water
   to the outlet, which most probably could be the reason for bad effluent
   quality at higher surface loading. Finally, three-dimensional flows were
   discovered, which also could have a deteriorating impact on the effluent
   quality. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{34}},

Pages = {{31-42}},

Abstract = {{The optimisation of acetate removal in sulfidogenic reactors by adding
   nitrate to the last compartment of a baffled reactor was evaluated. In a
   5.4 1 baffled reactor, containing three equal compartments, a VFA
   mixture (acetate:propionate:butyrate ratio 1:2:2 on COD basis; pH 8) was
   treated under mesophilic (30 degrees C) and sulfIdogenic (COD:SO42-
   ratio: 0.5) conditions. At a specific sludge loading rate of 1.1 g COD
   gSS(-1) d(-1); a COD and sulfate removal of 80 and 35\%, respectively,
   was obtained. In the baffled reactor, staging of the sulfidogenic VFA
   degradation occurred. Propionate and butyrate were mainly degraded in
   the first compartment. Their degradation was incomplete, resulting in
   elevated acetate concentrations in Compartment I. In the second and
   third compartment of the baffled reactor, a net degradation of acetate
   took place. Acetate was the sole substrate present in Compartment III
   and residual acetate concentrations of about 600 mg/l were present in
   the effluent at the highest specific sludge loading applied. In the
   three compartments, development of sludges with different maximum
   specific acetate degrading activities was observed. The maximal specific
   activity with acetate was three times higher in sludge growing in
   Compartment III as compared to sludge growing in Compartment I. Batch
   experiments showed that the addition of about 500 mg/l nitrate
   (COD/nitrate ratio of 2.5) increased the specific acetate degradation
   rate by 300\%. Nitrate was denitrified (pH optimum of 7.0-8.0) with a
   temporary accumulation of the intermediate nitrite. When 2.3 g/l nitrate
   (COD/nitrate ratio of O.S) was dosed in compartment III of the baffled
   reactor, the effluent acetate concentration could be decreased from 600
   to 100 mg/l. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An electrochemical membrane process was used to treat complexed Cu-II
   solutions of citric acid, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), and
   ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). An equimolar solution of Cu-II
   and complexing agent was focused. The iridium oxide (IrO2/Ti) and Pt
   (Pt/Ti) coated on titanium were used as anode and cathode, respectively.
   The cation exchange membrane Neosepta CM-1 was adopted. Experiments were
   carried out at different current densities (18.5-139 A/m(2)), initial
   catholyte pH and Cu-II concentrations (0.01-0.08 M), and initial anolyte
   NaNO3 concentrations (0.001-0.2 M). An economically feasible current
   efficiency and recovery percentages of metals and complexing agents
   could be achieved if the concentration of the complexed Cu-II was
   sufficiently high. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to study the prevalence of enteric pathogens capable of causing
   clinical illness in the environment, bacterial isolates collected from
   diarrhoeal patients, coastal waters and shellfish (including oysters,
   mussels and clams) were analysed by comparing their serotypes and by
   examining for the presence of particular pathogenic characteristics in
   the environmental isolates. Salmonellae (66\%) dominated the 1211
   bacterial isolates from diarrhoeal patients, followed by campylobacters
   (13\%) and shigellae (6\%). Vibrios and salmonellae made up the majority
   (85\%) of the 458 isolates from coastal waters and shellfish. Among 870
   Salmonella isolates serotyped, high incidences of S. typhimurium and S.
   enteriditis isolated from diarrhoeal patients were not observed in the
   case of the coastal waters nor shellfish. The Salmonella serotype
   distribution of clinical isolates, in general, were different from those
   isolated from coastal waters as well as shellfish. The most commonly
   isolated Salmonella species from the environmental samples were S. derby
   (13.7\%) and S. infantis (12.3\%) with serogroup O4 (31.5\%) being the
   most commonly isolated serogroup. Among all the Vibrio ssp, isolated
   from the environmental samples, neither V. cholerae O1 causing epidemic
   infection worldwide nor V. cholerae O139 which had been reported to
   cause epidemics in India and Bangladesh in 1992 and 1993 was found. For
   the V. parahaemolyticus isolates, all clinical isolates produced
   thermostable direct haemolysin (Vp-TDH), while only a small percentage
   (1.5\%) of the environmental isolates could produce Vp-TDH. In
   conclusion, no significant common characteristics had been found between
   the clinical isolates and those from the environmental sources. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The formation of biofilm on polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE)
   and stainless steel surfaces was studied in bank infiltrated and
   chemically purified waters without (control water) and with ozonation.
   Ozonation increased the concentration of assimilable organic carbon
   (AOC) in water (78 vs 450 mu gC/l). Ozonation of water increased the
   viable numbers and cell volume of heterotrophic bacteria on the
   surfaces. The highest bacterial count, 7.7 x 10(5) cfu/cm(2), was
   detected on PVC surface after three weeks' exposure to ozonated water.
   The numbers of heterotrophic bacteria on surfaces reflected the
   bacterial numbers in water. There was no difference in total cell count
   on different surfaces and in control and ozonated waters. Direct
   staining of microbes on the surfaces produced higher cell count per
   cm(2) than enumerating microbes detached from surfaces by sonication. In
   general, the accumulation of biofilm on different surface materials was
   quite similar. Only the cell volume was slightly higher on PE than on
   PVC surface. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{71-84}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Results are presented from a study into the effects of scuba diving on
   water column structure in perennially ice-covered Lake Fryxell,
   Antarctica. General theoretical predictions are compared with results,
   which assess potential impacts from diving activities on water quality
   parameters related to disruptions to water column stability and
   dissolved gas concentrations. Potential mechanisms of water column
   disturbance are considered including: (1) mixing due to diver motion,
   (2) mixing by diver-exhaled bubble plumes and (3) changes of water
   column gas concentrations due to dissolution of diver-exhaled gases.
   Data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, pH, dissolved
   organic carbon, salinity) were collected from two control holes and one
   dive hole immediately before and 2.5 d after dive activities.
   Variability in measured parameters did not differ significantly between
   sampling sites either before or after diving; and differences between
   control holes and dive hole observations, on a depth-by-depth basis,
   were within the range of expected statistical fluctuations. Pre- and
   post-dive virus-like particle, bacterial, ciliate, photo- and
   heterotrophic flagellate densities also did not differ significantly. An
   apparent lack of long-term trends indicative of water column
   destabilization over the past 18 ys of diving is discussed, along with
   recent evidence for deep mixing in this lake. Although all potentially
   affected parameters have not been considered, theoretical model results
   and an analysis of field data suggest that diving impacts on
   physicochemical properties and microbial distributions in a
   closed-basin, ice-covered lake occur at spatiotemporal scales other than
   those considered in this study. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Disappearance of Aroclor 1242 was observed in a continuously operated
   upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor inoculated with granular
   anaerobic sludge. To distinguish between sorption and dechlorination
   processes, extraction of Aroclor from the sludge was performed along
   with the measurements of chloride and Aroclor in the reactor effluent. A
   release of inorganic chloride combined with the enrichment in lightly
   chlorinated congeners was observed. Based on the chloride balance, the
   dechlorination process was found to be Aroclor concentration-limited at
   an Aroclor load of 0.4 mg/(g VSS day) due to a low solubility of Aroclor
   in water. While an addition of Tween 80 to the influent stream improved
   solubility of Aroclor, it led to self-inhibition of the dechlorination
   process at a load of 1.3 mg/(g VSS day). The maximal dechlorination rate
   observed in this study was 0.6 mg Aroclor/(g VSS day). Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{The acute toxicities of formaldehyde to one- and two-year-old pearl
   oysters, Pinctada fucata martensii. were determined under a semi-static
   condition at 20 and 25 degrees C. The median lethal concentration (LC50)
   lowered progressively as the duration of exposure increased. The
   toxicity curves became almost asymptotic with the time axis by 96 h. The
   96 h-LC50 was 7.7 mg/l at 20 degrees C and 5.3 mg/l at 25 degrees C for
   the one-year-old pearl oyster. It was 10.2 mg/l at 20 degrees C and 6.4
   mg/l at 25 degrees C for the two-year-old pearl oyster. Variations of
   the dissolved oxygen concentration and the formaldehyde concentration in
   the test solutions imply that pearl oyster can defend themselves from
   toxic effects of formaldehyde by reducing their respiration rate.
   Furthermore, pearl oysters are capable of lowering the formaldehyde
   concentration in surrounding water, thus defending themselves. (C) 1999
