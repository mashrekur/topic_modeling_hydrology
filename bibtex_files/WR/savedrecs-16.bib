Abstract = {{The industrial solvent tetrachloroethylene (PCE) is among the most
   ubiquitous chlorinated compounds found in groundwater contamination. The
   objective of this study was to develop an in situ two-layer biobarrier
   system consisting of an organic-releasing material layer followed by an
   oxygen-releasing material layer. The organic-releasing material, which
   contained sludge cakes from a domestic wastewater treatment plant, is
   able to release biodegradable organics continuously. The
   oxygen-releasing material, which contained calcium peroxide, is able to
   release oxygen continuously upon contact with water. The first
   organic-releasing material layer was to supply organics (primary
   substrates) to reductively dechlorinate PCE in situ. The second
   oxygen-releasing material layer was to release oxygen to aerobic
   biodegrade or cometabolize PCE degradation byproducts from the first
   anaerobic layer. Batch experiments were conducted to design and identify
   the components of the organic and oxygen-releasing materials, and
   evaluate the organic substrate (presented as chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) equivalent) and oxygen release rates from the organic-releasing
   material and oxygen-releasing materials, respectively. The observed
   oxygen and COD release rates were approximately 0.0368 and 0.0416 mg/d/g
   of material, respectively. A laboratory-scale column experiment was then
   conducted to evaluate the feasibility of this proposed system for the
   bioremediation of PCE-contaminated groundwater. This system was
   performed using a series of continuous-flow glass columns including a
   soil column, an organic-releasing material column, two consecutive soil
   columns, and an oxygen-releasing material column, followed by two other
   consecutive soil columns. Anaerobic acclimated sludges were inoculated
   in the first four columns, and aerobic acclimated sludges were
   inoculated in the last three columns to provide microbial consortia for
   contaminant biodegradation. Simulated PCE-contaminated groundwater with
   a flow rate of 0.25 L/d was pumped into this system. Effluent samples
   from each column were analyzed for PCE and its degradation byproducts.
   Results show that up to 99\% of PCE removal efficiency was obtained in
   this passive system. Thus, the biobarrier treatment scheme has the
   potential to be developed into an environmentally and economically
   acceptable remediation technology for the in situ treatment of
   PCE-contaminated aquifer. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The ozonation of herbicide 2,4-dichlorophoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was
   studied and modeled at different initial pH levels and initial
   concentrations. The degradation rate of 2,4-D was found to increase with
   the initial pH level and decrease with initial 2,4-D concentration. A
   two-stage ozonation of 2,4-D was observed, in which the initial stage of
   ozonation was slightly faster than the second stage due to the higher
   initial (saturated) ozone concentration; under these circumstances, the
   direct molecular ozone oxidation was likely to predominate. At the
   second stage, the indirect radical oxidation became more significant in
   determining the overall 2,4-D oxidation, and the reaction was more
   pH-dependent. A mathematic model associated with the analytical
   solutions consisting of direct and indirect oxidations contributed by
   the molecular ozone and free radical is proposed. The proposed model is
   capable of predicting the decay of 2,4-D quantitatively by ozonation at
   different initial pH levels and initial 2,4-D concentrations. (C) 2002

Title = {{Solar disinfection (SODIS): simulation of solar radiation for global

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Haiti and other developing countries do not have sufficient
   meteorological data to evaluate if they meet the solar disinfection
   (SODIS) threshold of 3-5 h of solar radiation above 500 W/m(2), which is
   required for adequate microbial inactivation in drinking water. We have
   developed a mathematical model based on satellite-derived daily total
   energies to simulate monthly mean, minimum, and maximum 5-h averaged
   peak solar radiation intensities. This model can be used to assess if
   SODIS technology would be applicable anywhere in the world. Field
   measurements were made in Haiti during January 2001 to evaluate the
   model and test SODIS efficacy as a point-of-use treatment option. Using
   the total energy from a measured solar radiation intensity profile, the
   model recreated the intensity profile with 99\% agreement. NASA
   satellite data were then used to simulate the mean, minimum, and maximum
   5-h averaged peak intensities for Haiti in January, which were within
   98.5\%, 62.5\%, and 86.0\% agreement with the measured values,
   respectively. Most of the discrepancy was attributed to the
   heterogeneous nature of Haiti's terrain and the spatial resolution of
   the NASA data. Additional model simulations suggest that SODIS should be
   effective year-round in Haiti. Actual SODIS efficacy in January was
   tested by the inactivation of total coliform, E. coli, and H2S-producing
   bacteria. Exposure period proved critical. One-day exposure achieved
   complete bacterial inactivation 52\% of the time, while a 2-day exposure
   period achieved complete microbial inactivation 100\% of the time. A
   practical way of providing people with cold water every morning that has
   undergone a 2-day exposure would be to rotate three groups of bottles
   every morning, so two groups are out in the sun and one is being used
   for consumption. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of temperature and pH on the acidification of a synthetic
   gelatin based wastewater was investigated using an upflow anaerobic
   reactor. Gelatin degradation efficiency and rate, degree of
   acidification, and formation rate of volatile fatty acids and alcohols
   all slightly increased with temperature. Temperature affected the
   acidogenesis of gelatin according to the Arrhenius equation with an
   activation energy of 1.83 kcal/mol. Compared with temperature, pH had a
   more significant effect on the acidogenesis. Gelatin degradation
   efficiency substantially increased with pH, from 60.0\% at pH 4.0 to
   97.5\% at pH 7.0. The degree of acidification increased from 32.0\% at
   pH 4.0 to 71.6\% at pH 6.5, but dropped to 66.8\% when pH increased to
   7.0. The optimum pH for the overall acidogenic activity was found to be
   6.0, close to 5.9, the optimum pH calculated using a semi-empirical
   model. Operation at pH of 4.0-5.0 favored the production of propionate,
   hydrogen, whereas the operation at pH 6.0-7.0 encouraged the production
   of acetate, butyrate, and i-butyrate. The region between pH 5.0 and 6.0
   was the transition zone. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{As a result of the increasing anthropogenic activities in the gangetic
   plain, Ganga water quantity as well as quality has declined over the
   years. A major effort to clean Ganga, named Ganga Action Plan (GAP) was
   instituted by the Government of India in 1984. The emphasis in GAP was
   on the reduction of organic load on the river through interception,
   diversion and treatment of wastewater reaching the river, thus
   maintaining the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen
   (DO) levels of river within the acceptable limits. A major criticism of
   GAP is that the significance of river ecology has not been addressed
   adequately during its conception and implementation. One of the
   important aspects from this perspective is the photosynthetic activity
   in the river Ganga. It has been postulated that photosynthetic activity
   plays an important role in maintaining high levels of DO in Ganga, and
   as a result the river can assimilate high organic loads without
   appreciable depletion in dissolved oxygen levels. Objective of the
   present study was to assess the photosynthetic activity and oxygen
   production rates in the river and correlate these values with various
   water quality parameters. Most polluted stretch of Ganga, which is known
   as the Kannauj-Kanpur stretch was chosen for this study. Based on the
   results of the study, it was concluded that despite implementation of
   phase I of GAP, and consequent diversion and reduction of organic
   loading to the river, both BOD and DO levels in the river has increased
   in the entire Kannauj-Kanpur stretch, except at Jajmau, where
   anaerobically treated effluent is discharged to the river. The nitrogen
   levels have also increased in the entire Kannauj-Kanpur stretch.
   Dissolved oxygen (DO) and alkalinity in the river water vary diurnally
   at all sites. Chlorophyll-a levels and oxygen production rates due to
   photosynthesis appear to be positively influenced by phosphate levels in
   the river water. Chlorophyll-a levels appear to be negatively correlated
   to the Ammonical and total Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) content in the
   river water, suggesting the possibility of release of nutrients due to
   algal death and decomposition under certain circumstances. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Peracetic acid (PAA) use in wastewater disinfection was assessed by
   examining its performances in a pilot plant fed by the effluent from a
   conventional activated-sludge treatment plant. The influence of PAA
   initial concentrations (0.5-4.0 mg/l) and contact times (8-38 min) on
   the presence of seven microorganisms (total coliforms, fecal coliforms,
   fecal streptococci, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., Salmonella sp.,
   and bacteriophages anti-E. coli) and on residual biocide and halogenated
   organic compound (AOXs) concentrations were evaluated. The data so
   obtained were compared to the corresponding results acquired using
   sodium hypochlorite (HYP) in the same experimental conditions.
   The biocide effect of PAA against total and fecal coliforms, E. coli,
   Pseudomonas sp. and Salmonella sp. was similar to that shown by HYP. The
   former disinfectant was, however, less efficient than the latter in the
   reduction of fecal streptococci and bacteriophages anti-E. coli. In both
   cases the biocide quantities initially introduced in the sewage resulted
   in the presence of significant concentrations at the end of the contact
   time. No significant variation of AOX content was detected in the
   effluent treated with PAA, whereas a progressive increment of such
   compounds was found when increasing quantities of HYP were added to the
   sewage. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in control engineering suggest that hybrid control
   strategies, integrating some ideas and paradigms existing in different
   soft computing techniques, such as fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms,
   rough set theory, and neural networks, may provide improved control
   performance in wastewater treatment processes. This paper presents an
   innovative hybrid control algorithm leading to integrate the distinct
   aspects of indiscernibility capability of rough set theory and search
   capability of genetic algorithms with conventional neural-fuzzy
   controller design. The methodology proposed in this study employs a
   three-stage analysis that is designed in series for generating a
   representative state function, searching for a set of multi-objective
   control strategies, and performing a rough set-based autotuning for the
   neural-fuzzy logic controller to make it applicable for controlling an
   industrial wastewater treatment process. Research findings in the case
   study clearly indicate that the use of rough set theory to aid in the
   neural-fuzzy logic controller design can produce relatively better plant
   performance in terms of operating cost, control stability, and response
   time simultaneously, which is effective at least in the selected
   industrial wastewater treatment plant. Such a methodology is anticipated
   to be capable of dealing with many other types of process control
   problems in waste treatment processes by making only minor
   modifications. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Subsurface permeable reactive barriers (PRB) have been used to
   successfully treat acidic mine drainage in Canada and offer great
   potential for doing the same in the United Kingdom. A PRB for the
   treatment of colliery spoil leachate from a site near Newcastle upon
   Tyne, UK, has been designed. The selection of the reactive media to be
   used is of paramount importance, with particular reference to
   permeability and reactivity. A number of reactive media mixtures
   containing varying proportions of cattle slurry screenings, green waste
   compost, calcite limestone chips and pea gravel were prepared and their
   respective permeabilities and reactivities were investigated.
   Media mixtures containing 50\% 10 mm grade calcite limestone chips
   showed better alkalinity addition and metals removal than a blank
   containing 50\% pea gravel. A media mixture containing 50\% limestone
   chips and 50\% green waste compost showed a 24 h period to achieve
   maximum addition of alkalinity and maximum removal of acidity and
   metals. Mixtures containing 25\% green waste compost and 25\% slurry
   screenings achieved maximum addition/removal in 4h.
   The likely presence of iron sulphide in samples drawn from test vessels
   during both test runs indicates that bacterial sulphate reduction is

Abstract = {{The formation and fate of soluble microbial products (SMP) in membrane
   bioreactor (MBR) was investigated at various sludge retention times
   (SRT) for 170 days. The SMP concentration was estimated by feeding
   glucose, which could be completely degraded, and by measuring the
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of the effluent from MBR. Under the
   conditions of SRT of 20 days, influent DOC of 112 mg/l and HRT of 6 h,
   the produced SMP was 4.7 mg DOC/l of which 57\% was removed or retained
   by the membrane. DOC of MBR supernatant increased during 100 days and
   then gradually decreased. Specific UV absorbance showed that the
   accumulated compounds had a portion of larger, more aromatic, more
   hydrophobic and double-bond-rich organics, which originated from the
   decayed biomass. Molecular weight distributions of SMP in MBR
   supernatant showed that the acclimated microorganisms in a long SRT
   could decompose high molecular weight organics, it caused the shift of
   molecular weight distributions of SMP to a lower range. During the
   operation period, enumeration of active cells in the MBR showed that
   microbial inhibitions by accumulated SMP was not observed. (C) 2002

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{128-138}},

Abstract = {{The application of sewage sludge to grassland can lead to the
   accumulation of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) at the soil surface
   that may be ingested, together with soil and herbage, by grazing
   ruminants. To investigate the extent to which the method of application
   of sludge to grassland might influence the accumulation of PTEs in body
   tissues of grazing sheep, two experiments were undertaken using
   grassland overlying two contrasting types of soil. At both sites, plots
   were either untreated or given liquid digested sludge in a single
   application in either autumn or spring by surface spreading or by
   injection. Weaned lambs were grazed on the experimental sites for 149
   days (Experiment 1) or 160 days (Experiment 2). Muscle, kidney and liver
   tissues were assayed for concentrations of PTEs at each slaughter date.
   Applications of sludge were reflected in elevated concentrations of Pb
   and Cu in soil in Experiment 1 only (P<0.05). Total loadings of PTEs for
   the treated grasslands did not exceed UK statutory limits to annual
   additions to soil. No significant differences were observed in the
   concentrations of PTEs in herbage between untreated and treated sites,
   with the exception of the concentration of Cu in herbage after surface
   application in the spring (Experiment 2). At the end of Experiment 1 the
   concentration of Cd tended to be higher in kidney tissues of lambs
   grazed on the pastures amended with sludge in the autumn compared to
   lambs grazed on untreated pastures. No other treatment effects were
   evident. Concentrations of PTEs in edible tissues of lambs grazed on
   grassland given a single dose of sludge were generally low and unlikely
   to pose a significant risk to the food chain. However, reduced food
   intake was observed in lambs grazed on grassland which had received
   sludge recently, indicating that the 21-day UK statutory no-grazing
   period should be reviewed in relation to grassland given sewage sludge
   in the spring. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{The diffusion of a chemical disinfectant into wastewater particles may
   be viewed as a serial two-step process involving transport through a
   macroporous network of pathways to micropores that lead into dense
   cellular regions. Previous research reveals that ultraviolet (UV) light
   penetration into wastewater particles is limited primarily to
   macropores, resulting in a residual concentration of targeted organisms
   in post-disinfected effluents that reflects the number of organisms
   embedded in the dense cellular regions of particles. Conversely,
   chlorine was demonstrated as part of this research to penetrate into
   both the macroporous and microporous network of pathways, implying that
   the application of chlorine may be designed feasibly to achieve a
   desired level of inactivation of particle-associated organisms. In the
   short term, a disinfection model previously developed for UV irradiation
   may be used to assess the inactivation of particle-associated organisms
   with chlorine. However, in the long-term, a more rigorous and complete
   understanding of the transport of chemical disinfectants into particles
   can be explored utilizing existing mathematical expressions commonly
   used to model mass transport into porous media. The parameters of
   interest in this modeling approach include the reaction rate of chlorine
   with particulate material, the diffusion rate of chlorine within a
   particle, the mass-transfer rate coefficient across the particle's
   boundary, and the particle porosity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   treatment process. Amount of DOC removed in biological treatment was
   defined as amount of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) in
   influent of biological treatment. DOC removal in the multi-stage
   ozonation-biological treatment was higher than that in the conventional
   single-stage ozonation-biological treatment with the same total
   ozonation time for the reservoir water and humic substances solution.
   Moreover, three- or four-stage ozonation for 5 min followed by
   biological treatment (total ozonation time 15 or 20 min) showed higher
   removal of DOC than the single-stage ozonation (60 min) and biological
   treatment. The higher DOC removal in the multi-stage treatment was due
   to the production of BDOC by ozonation. The long-term ozonation was not
   effective to produce BDOC because most of ozone was utilized to oxidize
   BDOC produced in the early stage of ozonation. In the multi-stage
   treatment, ozonation was effective to decompose refractory DOC and to
   produce BDOC because BDOC was removed by biological treatment. However,
   multi-stage ozonation-biological treatment was not effective for the
   secondary effluent. The reason seems to be high concentration of ozone
   scavengers in that water and low reactivity of DOC for ozone. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The sedimentation characteristics of flocculated wastewater sludge have
   not been satisfactorily explored using the non-destructive techniques,
   partially owing to the rather low solid content (ca. 1-2\%) commonly
   noted in the biological sediments. This paper investigated, for the
   first time, the spatial-temporal gravitational settling characteristics
   of original and polyelectrolyte flocculated waste activated sludge using
   Computerized Axial Tomography Scanner. The waste activated sludge
   possessed a distinct settling characteristic from the kaolin slurries.
   The waste activated sludges settled more slowly and reached a lower
   solid fraction in the final sediment than the latter. Flocculation
   markedly enhanced the settleability of both sludges. Although the
   maximum achievable solid contents for the kaolin slurries were reduced,
   flocculation had little effects on the activated sludge. The purely
   plastic theological model by Buscall and White (J Chem Soc Faraday Trans
   1(83) (1987) 873) interpreted the consolidating sediment data, while the
   purely elastic model by Tiller and Leu (J. Chin. Inst. Chem. Eng. 11
   (1980) 61) described the final equilibrated sediment. Flocculation
   produced lower yield stress during transient settling, thereby resulting
   in the more easily consolidated sludge than the original sample.
   Meanwhile, the flocculated activated sludge was stiffer in the final
   sediment than in the original sample. The data reported herein are
   valuable to the theories development for clarifier design and operation.

Title = {{Arsenic removal using a polymeric/inorganic hybrid sorbent}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{164-176}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A fixed-bed sorption process can be very effective in removing trace
   concentrations of arsenic from contaminated groundwater provided: the
   sorbent is very selective toward both As(III) and As(V) species; the
   influent and treated water do not warrant any additional pre- or post-
   treatment; pH and composition of the raw water with respect to other
   electrolytes remain unchanged besides arsenic removal, and the sorbent
   is durable with excellent attrition resistance properties. In addition,
   the sorbent should be amenable to efficient regeneration for multiple
   reuse. This study reports the results of an extensive investigation
   pertaining to arsenic removal properties of a polymeric/inorganic hybrid
   sorbent. Each hybrid sorbent particle is essentially a spherical
   macroporous cation exchanger bead within which agglomerates of nanoscale
   hydrated Fe oxide (HFO) particles have been uniformly and irreversibly
   dispersed using a simple chemical-thermal treatment. The new sorbent,
   referred to as hybrid ion exchanger or HIX, combines excellent
   mechanical and hydraulic properties of spherical polymeric beads with
   selective As(III) and As(V) sorption properties of HFO nanoparticles at
   circum-neutral pH. Comparison of the results of fixed-bed column runs
   between the new sorbent and the polymeric anion exchanger confirmed that
   both As(V) and As(III) were removed very selectively with HIX. Equally
   important, no pH adjustment, pre- or post-treatment was warranted.
   Besides the absence of arsenic, the treated water composition was
   identical to that of influent water. HIX was amenable to efficient in
   situ regeneration with caustic soda and could subsequently be brought
   into service following a short rinse with carbon dioxide sparged water.
   During fixed-bed column runs, intraparticle diffusion was identified as
   the primary rate-limiting step for both As(III) and As(V) sorption.
   Repeated use of the same HIX particles during various laboratory
   investigations provided strong evidence that the new sorbent possesses
   excellent attrition resistance properties and retains its arsenic
   removal capacity over cycles. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A laboratory model nitrifying activated sludge plant treating OECD
   synthetic sewage was designed and constructed by each of three
   laboratories in Germany, Scotland and Spain in order to produce a sludge
   inoculum for 5 rapid toxicity bioassays. The plants were run for 3 years
   and produced sludge for the microbially based bioassays Vibrio fischeri
   bioluminescence, ATP luminescence and respiration, and, nitrification
   and enzyme inhibition. Although the initial sludge inoculum for the
   plants differed, as did some of the running conditions such as
   temperature regime, the sludge produced within the different countries
   had similar characteristics with respect to sludge age, total suspended
   solids and volatile suspended solids. Nitrification was generally
   maintained over the 3-year period although there were occasions when the
   process was inconsistent. Nitrification recovery was afforded by
   reseeding with a nitrifying sludge from a local wastewater treatment
   works (WWTW) or imposition of starvation conditions for a period of
   time.
   The sludge produced was used to carry out toxicity testing and results
   compared well with those using sludge from a WWTW. Overall, the use of
   sludge generated in the laboratory could be used for toxicity testing
   negating the need to resort to the use of natural WWTW sludge, which may
   contain a range of toxic substances due to uncontrolled industrial and
   domestic inputs and an unbalanced microbial consortium. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The ammonia oxidation of a mixed culture enriched from a wastewater
   treatment plant sludge was monitored by a DO probe and a nicotinamide
   adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) fluorometer. Under fixed
   aeration, DO reflected ammonia oxidation effectively. According to the
   DO profiles and the total ammonia concentrations analyzed
   experimentally, the ammonia oxidation kinetics of the enriched culture
   was determined. The ammonia oxidation rate was found sensitive to pH,
   especially at low total ammonia concentrations. At high concentrations
   of total ammonia, the maximum ammonia oxidation rate occurred at pH 7.6
   +/- 0.1. At low concentrations, the pH sensitivity intensified
   significantly and the apparent optimal pH shifted higher with decreasing
   total ammonia concentrations, because NH3 molecules were the true
   substrate for ammonia oxidation and more NH4 ions were converted to NH3
   molecules at higher pH. The ammonia oxidation kinetics was therefore
   developed according to the concentration of NH3 molecules, instead of
   the commonly used total ammonia concentration. The kinetics followed
   Michaelis-Menten behavior for both DO and NH3 concentration: the maximum
   rate was 16.7 +/- 0.7mg NH3-N/(g TSS-h) and the Michaelis constants for
   DO and NH3 were (14 +/- 2)\% air saturation and (4.4 +/- 0.4) x 10(-2)
   (mg NH3-N/L), respectively. It was also concluded from the study that
   with or without exogenous organic substances, the NAD(P)H fluorescence
   of the enriched nitrifying culture was undetectable. The fluorescence
   did not respond to addition or depletion of substrate (ammonia, glucose,
   or acetate), change between aerobic and anaerobic conditions, or even
   KCN addition to kill the culture. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Chloramination for secondary disinfection of drinking water often
   promotes the growth of nitrifying bacteria in the distribution system
   due to the ammonia introduced by chloramine formation and decay. This
   study involved the application of molecular biology techniques to
   explore the types of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and
   nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) present in several full-scale
   chloraminated systems. The results of AOB community characterization
   indicated the ubiquitous detection of representatives from the
   Nitrosomonas genus, with Nitrosospira constituting a negligible or small
   fraction of the AOB community in all but one sample. Cloning and
   sequencing demonstrated the presence of AOB representatives within the
   Nitrosomonas oligotropha cluster, a phylogenetic subgroup of AOB from
   which isolates demonstrate a high affinity for ammonia. For the NOB
   communities, Nitrospira were detected in most of the samples, while
   Nitrobacter were only detected in a few samples. These results provide
   insight into the types of AOB responsible for nitrification episodes in
   full-scale chloraminated systems, which should help direct future
   studies aimed at characterizing relevant AOB growth and inactivation
   properties. Furthermore, the detection of NOB in most of the samples
   suggests a need to evaluate the contribution of biological nitrite
   oxidation relative to chemical oxidation in these systems. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Flow rate, electron donor addition, and biomass control were evaluated
   in order to optimize perchlorate (ClO4-) removal from drinking water
   using biologically active carbon (BAC) filtration. Influent dissolved
   oxygen (DO) was lowered from ambient conditions to approximately 2.5
   mg/L for all experiments using a nitrogen sparge. When influent nitrate
   concentration was 0-2.0 mg/L, 1.6-2.8 mg/L as carbon of acetate or
   ethanol was required to achieve and sustain the complete removal of 50
   mug/L perchlorate in a BAC filter. Most or all of the exogenous acetate
   and ethanol was removed during biofiltration. When a 72-h electron donor
   feed failure was simulated, a maximum perchlorate breakthrough of 18
   mug/L was observed and, once electron donor was reapplied, 9 days were
   required to reestablish complete perchlorate removal. During a 24-h
   electron donor feed failure simulation, the maximum effluent perchlorate
   concentration detected was 6.7 mug/L. Within 24h of reactivating the
   electron donor, the filter regained its capacity to consistently remove
   50 mug/L perchlorate to below detection. Although biomass growth
   diminished the filter's ability to consistently remove perchlorate, a
   cleaning procedure immediately restored stable, complete perchlorate
   removal. This cleaning procedure was required approximately every 50
   days (4800 bed volumes) when influent DO concentration was 2.5 mg/L.
   Empty-bed contact time (EBCT) experiments showed that 80\% perchlorate
   removal was achieved using a 5-min EBCT, and complete perchlorate
   removal was observed for an EBCT of 9 min. It was also demonstrated that
   BAC filtration consistently removed perchlorate to below detection for
   influent perchlorate concentrations ranging from 10 to 300 mug/L,
   influent sulfate concentrations between 0 and 220 mg/L, influent pH
   values of 6.5-9.0, and operating temperatures of 5-22degreesC. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Adsorption of Co(II) ions from aqueous sepiolite suspensions has been
   systematically investigated as a function of several variables including
   activation conditions, solid to liquid ratio, pH and temperature. The
   results are analyzed to identify the mechanism of cobalt uptake by
   sepiolite. Both abstraction and real adsorption isotherms were
   constructed to isolate the precipitation of cobalt from the real
   adsorption. Also, for the first time a plausible correlation between the
   released Mg (II) ions from sepiolite matrix and those adsorbed Co (II)
   ions is made. A one to one ion exchange mechanism is found to describe
   the results. The data obtained from adsorption isotherms at different
   temperatures were fitted to various adsorption models to calculate
   thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy of adsorption, heat of
   adsorption and entropy of adsorption. The thermodynamic data indicate
   that Co (11) adsorption onto sepiolite is entropically driven and
   characterized by physical adsorption. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   selectivity, wider linear range, simpler instrumentation. It is
   applicable for the determination of tannic acid in the range of 3.0 x
   10(-10)-1.0 x 10(-7) mol/L with a detection limit of 1.0 x 10(-10)
   mol/L. The relative standard deviation is 2.7\% for the determination of
   1.0 x 10(-8) mol/L tannic acid (n = 11). The method has been
   successfully used to determine tannic acid at trace level in industrial

Abstract = {{Bioremediation of consecutive spills of phenol, 2-chlorophenol (2-MCP),
   2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) and pentachlororphenol as single
   pollutants was investigated in eight pilot plant scale sand columns
   system (100 cm 1, 6 cm ID), simulating the conditions, which could be
   created in the saturated zone of a pristine aquifer following an
   accidental spill. Bioremediation in this study consisted of
   re-circulating local groundwater through the polluted site in a
   controlled manner following a closed-loop configuration. Intrinsic
   microbial development was enhanced by adding the necessary nutrients.
   Consecutive accidental spills of 480-mg phenol/kg soil; 140-mg 2-MCP/kg;
   14-mg 2,4,6-TCP/kg soil and 17-mg pentachlorophenol (PCP)/kg soil under
   saturated conditions and a continuous specific discharge of 0.56 cm
   min(-1) were simulated. Degradation curves demonstrated first-order
   kinetics. Biodegradation rates (k(1)) were influenced by consecutive
   exposures. Calculated rate constants for biodegradation for sole
   substrate experiments were in the range of 0.06-0.15 day(-1), 0.21-1.20
   day(-1), 0.04-2.28 day(-1) and 0.01-0.03 day(-1) for phenol, 2-MCP,
   2,4,6-TCP and PCP, respectively. The acclimation of the aquifer to
   simulated consecutive accidental spills was found to be directly
   proportional to the cumulative load of each single chlorophenol. A
   relationship between the octanol water partitioning (K-ow) values and
   the experimental degradation rates (k(1)) was found. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{The quality of private water supplies within Aberdeenshire sampled
   between 1992 and 1998 was analysed with respect to the presence of total
   coliforms (TC), faecal coliforms (FC), and nitrate. Of the similar to
   1750 samples analysed, which included multiple samples from larger
   supply categories, the individual failure rate was 41\%, 30\% and 15\%
   for TC, FC and nitrate, respectively. A combined failure rate for these
   samples was 48\%. Failure rates on microbiological grounds displayed a
   seasonal trend being greater during the latter half of the year.
   Although this observation is likely to be due to a combination of local
   and regional scale factors, part of the variability in failure rate was
   explained by a significant positive relationship with rainfall amount.
   Concentrations of nitrate tended to display an opposite trend with a
   greater number of failures occurring during the spring period and no
   relationship with rainfall was immediately apparent, A relatively small
   number of samples (<50) failed simultaneously for both coliforms and
   nitrate suggesting that the mechanism responsible for the contamination
   differed. A similar failure rate for samples collected directly from the
   source (i.e. well) compared with those taken from the potable tap
   (usually kitchen cold water tap) suggests that it is the groundwater
   source itself that contributes much of the microbiological and nitrate
   contamination rather than a storage or supply line contamination
   mechanism. A more frequent and random sampling of category one F
   supplies suggested a greater overall failure rate, which has its own
   implications for deciding an appropriate sampling frequency. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Sulphate-reducing biofilm and suspension processes were studied for
   treatment of synthetic wastewater containing sulphate, zinc and iron.
   With lactate supplemented wastewater with 170-230mg/l Zn and 58mg/l Fe,
   the following precipitation rates were obtained: 250 and 350mg/ld for Zn
   in fluidized-bed (FBR) and upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors,
   respectively, and 80mg/ld for Fe in both reactors with hydraulic
   retention time of 16h. The effluent Zn and Fe concentrations remained at
   less than 0.1 mg/l. The alkalinity produced in lactate oxidation
   increased the initial pH of 2.5-3, resulting in effluent pH of 7.5-8.5.
   The highest sulphate reduction rate was over 2000mg/ld. In terms of
   sulphate reduction, hydrogen sulphide production and effluent
   alkalinity, the start-up of the FBR with the 10\% fluidization rate was
   superior to the FBRs with 20-30\% fluidization rates. With increased
   loading rates, high recycling rate became an advantage. After process
   failure caused by intentional overloading, the sulphate reduction
   partially recovered within 2 weeks. Metal precipitates in the reactors
   were predominantly FeS(2), ZnS and FeS. The metal mass balance was as
   follows: 73-86\% of Zn and Fe accumulated into the reactors and water
   level adjustors, 14-23\% of the metals were washed out as precipitates
   and 0.05-0.15\% remained as soluble metals, Biomass yield in the
   sulphate-reducing processes was 0.039-0.054g dry biomass (VS or VSS) per
   g of lactate oxidized or 0.035-0.074g dry biomass per g of sulphate
   reduced. The results of this work demonstrate that the lactate
   supplemented sulphate-reducing processes precipitated the metals as
   sulphides and neutralized the acidity of the synthetic wastewater. (C)

Abstract = {{The abundance, fractionation and physicochemical forms of rare earth
   elements (REEs) were determined in five boreal humus-rich streams
   (dissolved organic carbon, DOC = 14-40 mg/l) affected by acid sulphate
   soils. The sampling was carried out during high-water flow in autumn
   when the acid sulphate soils are extensively flushed. The analytical
   procedures included ion-exchange experiments in field and ICP-MS
   determination. There was a general decrease in pH (range 4.5-6.2) and
   increase in the REE concentrations (La range 0.82-23 mug/l) as the
   proportion of the catchment cover of acid sulphate soils increased,
   explained by high amounts of REEs in the acidic runoff from such soils.
   In each stream, four different REE fractions were identified: (1) A
   cationic fraction, which is dominant in the REE-rich runoff from the
   acid sulphate soils and which is depleted in HREEs due to hydrochemical
   and/or geochemical processes. (2) an anionic fraction identified as
   humus-REE complexes, which in general is more abundant the higher the
   DOC concentrations and which also becomes increasingly abundant across
   the lanthanide series, (3) a fraction having a well-developed MREE
   enrichment, presumably consisting of colloidal REEs, and (4) a minor
   uncharacterised particle-associated fraction. The REE pool in the
   streams thus consists of several coexisting and contrasting REE species.
   The identification and quantification of such species is a prerequisite
   for the precise and accurate characterisation of the REE hydrochemistry
   of the streams. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure has been developed for the determination of non-ionic
   surfactants (NS) adsorbed on particles of alive and dead activated
   sludge. The procedure also enables the determination of adsorption of
   major biodegradation by-products: short-chained ethoxylates, long- and
   short-chained PEG. The basis of measurement is the determination of NS
   concentration in a slurry of activated sludge and in a solution phase.
   The difference between these two concentrations represents the NS
   adsorbed on activated sludge, Separation of NS and their
   biotransformation by-products from samples and then on narrower
   fractions was performed by a sequential liquid-liquid extraction and
   precipitation with modified Dragendorff reagent. The indirect
   tensammetric technique (ITT) was applied for the final determination.
   The developed method was checked using the example of the treatment of
   the surfactant C12E10 (oxyethylated fatty alcohol) (Cl2E10) in the
   continuous flow activated sludge facility, No statistically significant
   accumulation of C12E10 on the alive activated sludge was detected,
   probably because of faster C12E10 fission than its adsorption. However,
   significant adsorption of the short-chained ethoxylates (including free
   alcohol) on the alive activated sludge was found, as well as
   statistically significant adsorption of long- and short-chained PEG. The
   adsorption of surfactant C12E10 and its biodegradation by-products on
   dead activated sludge was found to be higher than the species adsorption
   on alive activated sludge. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Title = {{The enzymology of sludge solubilisation utilising sulphate-reducing

Abstract = {{The first stage in the degradation and recycling of particulate organic
   matter is the solubilisation and enhanced hydrolysis of complex
   polymeric organic carbon structures associated with the sulphidogenic
   environment. An investigation into the enzymology of these processes has
   shown that lipase enzyme activities were found predominantly associated
   with the organic particulate matter of the sewage sludge. Sonication of
   the sludge gave an increase in enzyme activity as the enzymes were
   released into the supernatant. pH and temperature optimisation studies
   showed optima between 6.5 and 8 and 50-60degreesC, respectively. All the
   lipase enzymes from the methanogenic bioreactors indicated extensive
   stability for at least an hour at their respective optimum temperatures
   and pH: sulphidogenic lipases reflected limited stability at these
   temperatures and pH during this time period. Though sulphate showed
   inhibitory properties towards lipases both sulphide and sulphite
   appeared to enhance the activity of the enzymes. It is argued that these
   sulphur species, liberated at different times during the sulphate
   reduction process, disrupt the integrity of the organic particulate floc
   by neutralising acidic components on the surface. The release of further
   entrapped enzymes from the organic particulate matter result in a
   subsequent enhancement of hydrolysis of polymeric material. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Metal biosorption behavior of raw seaweed S. filipendula in ten
   consecutive sorption-desorption cycles has been investigated in a
   packed-bed flow-through column during a continuous removal of copper
   from a 35 mg/L aqueous solution at pH 5. The elutant used was a 1\%
   (w/v) CaCl2/HCl-solution at pH 3. The sorption and desorption was
   carried out for an average of 85 and 15 h, respectively. representing
   more than 41 days of continuous use of the biosorbent. The weight loss
   of biomass after this time was 21.6\%. The Cu-biosorption capacity of
   the biomass, based on the initial dry weight, remained relatively
   constant at approximately 38 mg Cu/g. Loss of sorption performance was
   indicated by a shortening breakthrough time and a broadening
   mass-transfer zone. The column service time, considered up to 1 mg Cu/L
   in the effluent, decreased continuously from 25.4 h for the first to
   12.7 h for the last cycle. The critical bed length, representing the
   mass-transfer zone, increased almost linearly from 28 to 34cm.
   ``Life-factors{''} for S. filipendula were found to be 0.0008 h(-1) for
   the breakthrough time and 0.008cm/h for the critical bed length, using
   an exponential decay and linear fitting functions, respectively.
   Regeneration with CaCl2/HCl at pH 3 provided elution efficiencies up to
   100\%. Maximum concentration factors were determined to be in the range
   16-44, a decreasing tendency was observed with an increasing exposure
   time. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved (< similar to4 nm, dialysis in situ). colloidal (< 0.45 mum
   filtered, minus dissolved) and particulate (total, minus < 0.45 mum
   filtered) concentrations of Cu. Zn, Cd, (Al) in eight (three) mining
   polluted rivers were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (flame
   and graphite furnace). The metal size distribution in the rivers was
   compared to pH. Ca concentration, alkalinity, conductivity, and total
   organic carbon (TOC). Data plots based on the present and other studies
   also yielded information about the interrelations between TOC, pH and
   metal adsorption in rivers and lakes. Less than 10\% of Cu, Zn, and Cd
   were sorbed on particles or colloids in two rivers with average pH at
   3.1 and 5.1. whereas 46\%, 21\%. and 21\% of Cu, Zn, and Cd.
   respectively, occurred in sorbed form in six pH neutral rivers. In three
   pH neutral rivers, on average 55\% of Al was in colloidal form, whereas
   the dissolved and particulate fractions were 21\% and 23\%,
   respectively. Our data combined with data from similar studies support
   conclusions from other research suggesting that the percent fraction of
   metals adsorbed on particles rises steeply from almost zero to nearly
   100\%. within a narrow and element specific pH range, Changes in TOC
   concentration seem capable of shifting the pH to \% metal absorption
   curves in the order of one pH unit. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Catalytic wet oxidation of phenol was studied in a batch and a trickle
   bed reactor using 4.45\% Pt/TiO2 catalyst in the temperature range
   150-205degreesC. Kinetic data were obtained from batch reactor studies
   and used to model the reaction kinetics for phenol disappearance and for
   total organic carbon disappearance. Trickle bed experiments were then
   performed to generate data from a heterogeneous flow reactor. Catalyst
   deactivation was observed in the trickle bed reactor, although the exact
   cause was not determined. Deactivation was observed to linearly increase
   with the cumulative amount of phenol that had passed over the catalyst
   bed. Trickle bed reactor modeling was performed using a three-phase
   heterogeneous model. Model parameters were determined from literature
   correlations, batch derived kinetic data, and trickle bed derived
   catalyst deactivation data. The model equations were solved using
   orthogonal collocations on finite elements. Trickle bed performance was
   successfully predicted using the batch derived kinetic model and the
   three-phase reactor model. Thus, using the kinetics determined from
   limited data in the batch mode, it is possible to predict continuous
   flow multiphase reactor performance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Mussel control in cooling water systems is generally achieved by means
   of chlorination. Chlorine is applied continuously or intermittently,
   depending on cost and discharge criteria. In this paper, we examined
   whether mussels will be able to survive intermittent chlorination
   because of their ability to close their valves during periods of
   chlorination. Experiments were carried out using three common species of
   mussels: a freshwater mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, a brackish water
   mussel, Mytilopsis leucophaeata and a marine mussel, Mytilus edulis. The
   mussels were subjected to continuous or intermittent (4 h chlorination
   followed by 4 h no chlorination) chlorination at concentrations varying
   from 1 to 3 mg l(-1) and their responses (lethal and sublethal) were
   compared to those of control mussels. In addition, shell valve activity
   of mussels was monitored using a Mussel-monitor(R). Data clearly
   indicate that mussels shut their valves as soon as chlorine is detected
   in the environment and open only after chlorine dosing is stopped.
   However, under continuous chlorination mussels are constrained to keep
   the shell valves shut continuously. The mussels subjected to continuous
   chlorination at 1 mg l(-1) showed 100\% mortality after 588 It (D.
   polymorpha), 966 h (Mytilus edulis) and 1104 h (Mytilopsis
   leucophaeata), while those subjected to intermittent chlorination at 1
   mg l(-1) showed very little or no mortality during the same periods.
   Filtration rate, foot activity index and shell valve movement of D.
   Polymorpha. Mytilopsis leucophaeata and Mytilus edulis decreased more
   than 90\% at 1 mg l(-1) chlorine residual when compared to control.
   However. mussels subjected to intermittent chlorination showed a similar
   reduction (about 90\%) in filtration rate, foot activity index and shell
   valve movement during chlorination and 3\% during breaks in
   chlorination. The data indicate that intermittent chlorination between 1
   and 3 mg l(-1) applied at 4h on and 4h off cycle is unlikely to control
   biofouling if mussels are the dominant fouling organisms. (C) 2002

Title = {{Microbial contamination of two urban sandstone aquifers in the UK}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{339-352}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Development of urban groundwater has historically been constrained by
   concerns about its quality. Rising urban water tables and
   overabstraction from rural aquifers in the UK have led to a renewed
   interest in urban groundwater, particularly the possibility of finding
   water of acceptable quality at depth. This study assessed the microbial
   quality of groundwater collected from depth-specific intervals over a
   15-month period within the Permo-Triassic Sherwood Sandstone aquifers
   underlying the cities of Nottingham and Birmingham. Sewage-derived
   bacteria (thermotolerant coliforms, faecal streptococci and
   sulphite-reducing clostridia) and viruses (enteroviruses, Norwalk-like
   viruses, coliphage) were regularly detected to depths of 60 m in the
   unconfined sandstone and to a depth of 91 m in the confined sandstone.
   Microbial concentrations varied temporally and spatially but increased
   frequency of contamination with depth coincided with geological
   heterogeneities such as fissures and mudstone bands. Significantly,
   detection of Norwalk-like viruses and Coxsackievirus B4 in groundwater
   corresponded with seasonal variations in virus discharge to the sewer
   system. The observation of low levels of sewage-derived microbial
   contaminants at depth in the Triassic Sandstone aquifer is explained by
   the movement of infinitesimal proportions of bulk (macroscopic)
   groundwater flow, along preferential pathways (e.g.. fissures. bedding
   planes). The existence of very high microbial populations at source (raw
   sewage) and their extremely low detection limits at the receptor
   (multilevel piezometer) enable these statistically extreme (microscopic)
   flows to be traced. Rapid penetration of microbial contaminants into
   sandstone aquifers, not previously reported, highlights the
   vulnerability of sandstone aquifers to microbial contamination. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The present study relates to the influence of hydraulic shock loads and
   total dissolved solids ( TDS) on the performance of three large-scale
   common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) treating textile effluents,
   which is generated from clusters of small-scale industries in the state
   of Rajasthan in India. Of the three CETPs, two having capacities 7.0 and
   9.0 million liters per day (mld) are located in Pali and one of capacity
   6.0 mld in Balotra, District Barmer. Wastewater from about one thousand
   small-scale industries is treated in these CETPs. The effects of
   hydraulic shock loads and TDS on effluent data from secondary clarifier
   for parameters biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids (SS)
   for CETPs at Pali, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) and SS for the CETP
   at Balotra were studied. It was observed that the effluent BOD and SS
   remained within the prescribed limits for CETP Pali at 30\% increased
   flow rate, whereas effluent COD and SS at 30\% increased flow rate for
   CETP Balotra exceeded the prescribed limits and the CETP could sustain
   20\% increased flow rate. The shock loading analysis revealed that CETP
   Balotra had reduced capacity to sustain shock loads by 10\% as compared
   to CETP Pali due to the presence of high TDS (15000-20000 mg/l). High
   TDS interfered with the oxygen transfer necessary for biological
   metabolism, thereby affected the efficiency of activated sludge process.
   Hence. activated sludge process treating high TDS effluents are more
   sensitive to hydraulic shock loads and prone to process upsets. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{This paper explores the possibility of using treated bark to remove oily
   compounds from water. Bark was first biologically or chemically treated
   and saturated with transition metal ions (TMI) to avoid the release of
   soluble organic compounds from the bark in the treated effluents.
   Several experimental parameters affecting the oil removal efficiency
   (RE) were studied (initial oil concentration, temperature, time. etc.).
   Saturated bark was characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
   spectroscopy and bark wetting index was determined. Results of the
   retention of lipids suggested that their removal could exceed 95\% of
   initial oil concentration. The uptake of lipid by treated bark varied
   from 0.2 to 2.0 g of organic oil/g of dry sorbent. No significant
   chemical modifications of saturated bark were observed in infrared
   spectroscope after the sorption of oleic acid on bark treated with
   transition metal ions. The structure of adsorbed tridimentional layer of
   oleic acid molecules seemed to take place through the double bond. The
   hydrocarbon RE exceeded 95\% using oil-water mixture with a
   hydrocarbon/bark ratio of one.
   The sorption reaction of hydrocarbons and lipids was quasi-instantaneous
   and seemed to be influenced by the temperature. This indicated that the
   retention mechanism was related to the capillary action. Results of FTIR
   spectroscopy suggested that no chemical bonds between barks and oily
   compounds were established. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study evaluated granular activated carbons (GACs) using rapid
   small-scale column tests (RSSCTs) on methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE)
   levels from 20 to 2000 mug/L, with or without the presence of tert-butyl
   alcohol, benzene, toluene, p-xylene (BTX) in two groundwater (South Lake
   Tahoe Utility District {[}Lake Tahoe, CA] and Arcadia Well Field
   {[}Santa Monica. CA]) and a surface water source (Lake Perris, CA).
   Direct comparison between two GACs was made for RSSCTs conducted with
   surface water from Lake Perris. The impact of natural organic matter on
   GAC performance was investigated and found to correspond with total
   organic carbon concentration in the three source waters. Significant
   reduction in GAC performance for MTBE due to competitive adsorption from
   soluble fuel components (e.g., BTX) was observed. Little or no
   difference in GAC usage rate or bed life was detected as the empty-bed
   contact time is changed from 10 to 20 min for RSSCTs conducted in the
   two groundwater sources, whereas the RSSCTs conducted in the surface
   water source exhibited significant increase in GAC usage rate as the
   empty-bed contact time is decreased from 20 to 10 min. This finding
   suggests that the higher NOM content of the surface water over the
   groundwater sources caused a greater competitive-adsorption effect that
   made more sites on the GAC to be unavailable to MTBE, thus decreasing
   its rate of adsorption and GAC performance for MTBE. Finally, the impact
   of differential influent MTBE concentration on GAC performance was
   demonstrated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   the rate of plume entrainment flux, an indicator of mixing
   effectiveness; and the oxygen dissolution efficiency are analyzed as
   functions of G and,If for different air bubble sizes to describe optimum

Abstract = {{In many drinking water treatment plants. the chlorination process is one
   of the main techniques used for the disinfection of water. This
   disinfecting treatment leads to the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs)
   such as chloroform, dichlorobromomethane, chlorodibromomethane and
   bromoform. In this study. head space-solid-phase microextraction
   (HS-SPME, 85 mum carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane fiber) technique was
   applied for the analysis of THMs in drinking water. The effects, of
   experimental parameters such as kinds of SPME fiber, the volume ratio of
   sample to headspace. the addition of salts, magnetic stirring,
   extraction temperature. extraction time and desorption time on the
   analysis were investigated. Analytical parameters such as linearity.
   repeatability and limit of detection were also evaluated. The results of
   THMs from the survey of Seongnam (Korea) drinking water samples showed
   that the highest total trihalomethane and chloroform were 24.03 and
   13.34 mug/l, which were well within the Korean drinking water quality

Abstract = {{Microbial population dynamics to gradual temperature change in an
   enhanced biological phosphorus removal system was kinetically
   investigated. As the temperature rose from 20.0degreesC to 30.0degreesC,
   and to 35.5degreesC, the predominant microbial group changed from the
   phosphorus-accumulating organisms. PAOs (47-70\% of total VSS) to the
   glycogen-accumulating organisms (64-75\% of total VSS), and to the
   ordinary heterotrophs (90\% of total VSS), respectively. Despite the
   species alteration, the phosphorus contents of the PAOs appeared to be
   steady within 0.182-0.308 mg/ mgVSS(PAO) regardless of the temperature
   level. The initial specific phosphorus release rates. which are solely
   due to the PAOs activities, increased with the temperature from
   37.5-55.9 to 51.8-61.3, 52.0-76.9, 147.2-210.3, and 374.2-756.3 mg P/gm
   VSSPAO h, at 20.0degreesC. 25.0degreesC, 30.0degreesC, 32.5degreesC. and
   35.0degreesC, respectively. On the other hand, mean initial specific
   phosphorus uptake rates of the biomass decreased as the temperature
   increased however, the data implied that the rate of the PAOs was higher
   than the other two microbial groups. These results indicate that the
   PAOs are lower-range mesophiles or possibly psychrophiles, As the
   temperature rises, the portion of energy required for maintenance
   increases substantially which reduces the energy availability for cell
   reproductiom hence, the PAOs are washed out from the system. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The models such as the eutrophication ecosystem model of West Lake,
   Hangzhou (EEM), are always used to make policy decisions for
   eutrophication management. Thus it is important to know the uncertainty
   in the model predictions due to the combined effects of uncertainty in
   the full set of input variables, and the individual input parameters
   whose variations have the greatest effect on variations in model
   predictions. In this study, randomized methods based on Monte Carlo
   technique have been developed and applied to the model (EEM). The
   technique consists of parameter sensitivity analysis, randomly sampling
   from underlying probability distributions and multivariate regression
   analysis. With this technique, model uncertainties during modeling are
   clarified and their propagation evaluated. Results show that among the
   five input parameters selected for uncertainty analysis, the settling
   rate of algae SVS and water temperature TEM have the largest
   contribution to model prediction uncertainty of the model outputs (PC,
   PS and PHYT). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the field of water technology, forward uncertainty propagation is
   frequently used, whereas backward uncertainty propagation is rarely
   used. In forward uncertainty analysis, one moves from a given (or
   assumed) parameter subspace towards the corresponding distribution of
   the output or objective function. However, in the backward uncertainty
   propagation, one moves in the reverse direction, from the distribution
   function towards the parameter subspace. Backward uncertainty
   propagation. which is a generalisation of parameter estimation error
   analysis, gives information essential for designing experimental or
   monitoring programmes. and for tighter bounding of parameter uncertainty
   intervals. The procedure of carrying out backward uncertainty
   propagation is illustrated in this technical note by working example for
   an oxidation ditch wastewater treatment plant. Results obtained have
   demonstrated that essential information can be achieved by carrying out
   backward uncertainty propagation analysis, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

   Tyrosinase immobilized on CaA and on NaA could be re-used repeatedly

Abstract = {{Ethylene dibromide (EDB; dibromoethane) and trichloroethylene (TCE) are
   hazardous environmental pollutants. The use of plants to treat polluted
   sites and groundwater, termed phytoremediation, requires plants that can
   both effectively remove the pollutant as well as grow in the climatic
   region of the site. In this paper. we report that the tropical
   leguminous tree, Leuceana leticocephala var. K636, is able to take up
   and metabolize EDB and TCE. The plants were grown in sterile hydroponic
   solution without its symbiont, Rhizobium. EDB and TCE were both
   metabolized by the plant, as indicated by the formation of bromide ion
   from EDB and trichloroethanol from TCE. Each plant organ was
   independently capable of debromination of EDB. L. leucocephala is being

Abstract = {{The use of recoverable sulfur particles will enhance the feasibility and
   reduce the cost of bioleaching process. Three different forms of sulfur
   particles, powder, pastilles and pellets were used to study the
   utilization and recovery of sulfur, used as energy source for
   thiobacilli in the bioleaching process. The Langmuir isotherm was used
   to explain the adsorption equilibrium existing between the sorbed and
   suspended bacteria and the maximum adsorption capacity obtained from the
   Langmuir isotherm was utilized to determine the specific surface area of
   the sulfur particles. The specific surface area of sulfur particles was
   found to be the determining factor in the bioleaching process and not
   the particle size. The rates of pH reduction, sulfate production and
   metal solubilization increased with increasing specific surface area of
   the particles. The pH reduction and metal solubilization were
   significantly enhanced by the reuse of recovered sulfur particles. The
   efficiency of metal solubilization with recovered sulfur pastilles was
   comparable to that with sulfur powder. This study revealed the
   practicability of reusing the recovered sulfur pastilles in the
   bioleaching process. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   compounds in eggs}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Eggs of two Ardeid species, the Little Egret (Egretta garzetta) and the
   Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), were collected from
   two egretries located in the New Territories of Hong Kong with one
   located near the internationally acclaimed wetland reserve, the Mai Po
   Marshes, and the other in a remote site (A Chau). The eggs were analysed
   for organochlorine (OC) compounds including the DDTs, PCBs,
   hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and the chlordanes (CHLs). All of the OCs
   under investigation were detected in the eggs of both species with
   significantly higher levels in the Little Egret (DDTs, 560-2200: PCBs,
   270-1700; CHLs, 81-470ng g(-1) wet weight) than the Night Heron (DDTs,
   210-1200; PCBs, 85-600; CHLs 59-75ng g(-1) wet weight). The DDTs
   consisted mainly of DDE with levels ranging from 85\% to 95\% of the
   total. The HCHs were at about the same levels in both species (8.4-30ng
   g(-1) wet weight). All of the OCs had linear concentration probability
   distributions on a log-normal basis which were used to evaluate exposure
   associated with these compounds as part of a probabilistic risk
   analysis. A linear dose/response relationship for the percentage
   reduction in the survival of young associated with DDE in eggs was
   developed. This probabilistic relationship was used to establish the
   threshold level (1000ng g(-1) wet weight) at which there was a
   significant level of reduction in the survival of young above zero and
   the variability in DDE concentrations at this effect level. Using a
   threshold level of 1000ng g(-1) the calculated Risk Quotient (RQ) had a
   12.4\% probability of RQ exceeding unity with the Night Heron, and
   40.9\% with the Little Egret. These results indicate that the DDTs in
   eggs would be expected to be associated with adverse effects on the
   survival of young of both species, particularly the Little Egret. (C)

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the photodegradation of the
   organophosphorus pesticide fenthion in the environment from a human
   health effect viewpoint. The major photodegradation products of fenthion
   in an aqueous solution under UVB irradiation (280-320nm radiation) were
   identified as fenthion sulfoxide. 3-methyl-4-methylthiophenol (MMTP),
   dimethyl phosphorothioate and 3-methyl-4-methylsulfinylphenol (MMSP).
   MMTP, dimethyl phosphorothioate and MMSP were discovered as novel
   photodegradation products of fenthion. Kinetic analysis of these
   products showed the formation of MMTP and dimethyl phosphorothioate by
   the photochemical hydrolysis of fenthion, which was accelerated under
   alkaline conditions. The former was further oxidized to MMSP. Fenthion
   sulfoxide was directly produced by the oxidative reaction of fenthion.
   Contribution of dissolved oxygen in this photooxidation was observed by
   replacing the air with nitrogen gas in the reaction system. which
   prevented oxidative formation of fenthion sulfoxide from fenthion and
   MMSP from MMTP. These oxidative compounds were also formed from fenthion
   in the presence of singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) generated by the visible
   light irradiation of rose bengal solution, while 102 scavengers,
   L-histidine and sodium azide (NaN3) inhibited this reaction. The aqueous
   photolysis mechanisms of fenthion were proposed from a kinetic
   photolysis experiment study as follows: there were two kinds of UVB
   photodegradation pathways of fenthion, one being photochemical
   hydrolysis of the phosphorus-O-phenyl ester to form MMTP and dimethyl
   phosphorothioate, and the other oxygenation triggered by 102 and
   producing fenthion sulfoxide and MMSP. Therefore, the steady
   photodegradation products of fenthion in the water environment may be
   fenthion sulfoxide and MMSP. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights
