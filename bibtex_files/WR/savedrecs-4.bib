Abstract = {{The dilatometric technique is used to measure bound water in aerobically
   digested sludge. It is found that air liberated from the sludge sample
   during the freezing of the sludge water affects the quantity of unfrozen
   water (interpreted as bound water) determined by dilatometry. Both the
   freezing temperature and the solids concentration affect the measured
   bound water content. It is also found that the precision of dilatometry
   decreases with decreasing solids concentration and that the accuracy of
   dilatometry cannot be determined since there is no independent measure
   of unfrozen water.}},

Abstract = {{The biological phosphorus removal in fluidized bed biological reactor
   (FBBR) has been investigated. The feasibility of excess phosphorus
   uptake, assured by exposition of biomass to anaerobic-aerobic
   conditions, has been demonstrated on a bench-scale biofilm reactor
   working as sequencing batch reactor (SBR) and the limiting parameters
   have been established. Although the reactor worked effectively, it took
   several weeks for both acclimatization of biomass and selection of a
   biofilm rich in poly-P-bacteria. The highest phosphate uptake rates have
   been observed when strict anaerobic conditions were reached during the
   anaerobic phase. Using a fluidized bed, a thin biofilm, characterized by
   high surface/volume ratio and hence highly disposed towards substrate
   uptake, has been obtained and the overall phosphorus abatement, referred
   to the biomass present in the reactor, proved particularly effective.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorination of drinking water in the presence of bromide and dissolved
   organic carbon (DOG) leads to the formation of brominated and
   chlorinated disinfection by-products (DBP). The concentration of bromide
   ions in the raw water is a significant factor in the speciation of DBP
   formed, and causes shifts in trihalomethane (THM) formation from
   chlorinated to brominated species. Drinking water treatment techniques
   that remove organic contaminants without affecting bromide ion
   concentrations cause increases in the brominated THM. For the present
   study, three water supplies containing different DOC and ambient bromide
   concentrations were filtered through biologically assisted granular
   activated carbon (BGAC). Similar to adsorption and coagulation
   treatment, this treatment does not remove bromide from drinking water;
   also, THMFP (trihalomethane formation potential) analysis indicated that
   the chlorinated effluent contained higher concentrations of brominated
   THM in comparison to the influent. Although BGAC may increase the
   brominated THM, which may be more toxic than the chlorinated THM, the
   overall reduction of THMFP by DOC removal far exceeds this negative
   change, thereby producing a much less toxic finished drinking water.
   This work is part of a study to make high DOC surface waters on the
   Canadian prairie safe and palatable for small volume users (individuals
   or small communities).}},

Abstract = {{A process for the crystallized precipitation of ammonium by adding
   magnesium salt and phosphate were carried out in order to remove
   nitrogen and phosphorus as well as to improve the C/N ratio in swine
   wastewater. The optimal operation conditions were obtained as follows:
   reaction temperature (25 degrees C), reaction time (1 h), pH (7.5) and
   the molar ratio of NH4-N:PO4-P:M(g) = 1.0:0.9:0.9. Under these
   conditions, the maximum quantity of the crystallized precipitation
   occurred, the removal ratio of NH4-N increased to more than 90\% and the
   C/N ratio increased from 1.98 to more than 8, but phosphorus was not
   removed. On the other hand, when the molar ratio of NH4-N:PO4-P:M(g) =
   1.0:0.6:0.9, the ammonium and phosphorus removal ratio would be
   79.32-87.45\% and 40.3-88.5\%, respectively After completion of the
   crystallized precipitation of ammonium, an intermittent aeration process
   with an aeration to anaerobic time ratio of 1:1 h is used for this
   improved swine wastewater (T-N/BOD = 0.14, in which BOD = 8200 mg/l, T-N
   = 1166 mg/l, and NH4-N = 519 mg/l). The results obtained from these
   experiments showed that the removal ratio of T-N and NH4-N are 91 and
   99\%, respectively. T-P is not removed, while the removal ratio of PO4-P
   is 60\% when 3\% CaCl2 liquid is added.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of the photodegradation of TNT in a TiO2 slurry reactor is
   presented. The rates and extent of TNT transformation and mineralization
   are compared for photocatalytic and direct photolytic reactions under
   conditions of varying light energies and in the presence and absence of
   oxygen. Certain initial organic transformation products are identified
   for both photocatalytic and photolytic reactions. Nitrate, nitrite, and
   ammonium ions are analyzed and the possibility of semiconductor
   sensitization by colored compounds is considered. TNT was transformed
   rapidly under each set of photochemical conditions but destruction was
   faster and more complete with TiO2 photocatalysis. Transformation
   by-products were destroyed readily under oxygenated photocatalytic
   conditions and were observed to be more refractory under direct
   photolytic conditions. Mass balances performed on carbon and nitrogen
   revealed that when the TiO2 photocatalyst was utilized in the presence
   of oxygen and near u.v. radiation (lambda > 340 nm) approx. 90\% of the
   TNT was mineralized and 35\% of the total nitrogen was recovered as
   ammonium ion after 120 min. Among the large number of organic
   transformation products produced photocatalytically, trinitrobenzoic
   acid, trinitrobenzene and trinitrophenol have been identified as
   oxidative intermediate species and dinitroaniline as a reduction
   product. The photocatalytic transformation of TNT appears to involve
   both oxidative and reductive steps and sensitization by colored
   compounds plays no detectable role in degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Many laboratory tests are available to evaluate the dewaterability of a
   given sludge with a specific type of conditioner. However, most of these
   are empirical and shed little light on dewaterability mechanisms. The
   most common laboratory measurements are also not amenable to continuous
   or flow-through use for actual process application. Viscosity and
   streaming current are two methods of characterizing the effectiveness of
   sludge conditioning which may be advantageous in these aspects. Both can
   be used as measurements characterizing the liquid stream-centrate or
   filtrate-from the dewatering process. Thus, this study assessed the
   utility of determining the liquid stream viscosity or streaming current
   using both lab and full scale experiments. Results were compared to
   other laboratory measurements of dewaterability, such as the capillary
   suction time (CST), the conditioned sludge streaming current (SC), and
   centrate total solids. They were also compared to CST, cake solids
   content, filtrate turbidity, and percent solids recovery in full-scale
   dewaterability evaluations. A significant correlation between the
   centrate viscosity and CST was established, with both related to
   dewaterability as shown by other parameters. There was also a clear
   relationship between the CST, the filtrate SC, and these with other
   dewaterability measures, such as the solids recovery, in the full-scale
   testing. A minimum CST, SC values near-zero for both centrate and
   conditioning sludge, and minimum centrate or filtrate viscosity all
   correlate with maximum solids recovery. These results are of
   significance both in explaining conditioning and dewatering mechanisms
   and for possible application in feedback control of polymer dose.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model has been developed and calibrated for a two-stage
   (A + B) activated sludge pilot plant treating wastewater from a
   chemical-pharmaceutical industry. Two series of simulations have been
   performed: (a) by using typical values for the parameters of the model
   from the bibliography, which remain constant with time, and (b) by
   using, for some parameters, values which are variable with time, and are
   determined following a specific methodology. The calibration is
   constrained to be exactly consistent with daily observations of COD from
   the effluent and reactor suspended solids (MLSS). Three internal
   parameters of the system were thus obtained in their daily variation:
   MLSS growth rate, specific substrate removal rate and concentration
   factor in: the settling tank. Mean values obtained for MLSS growth rate
   were 0.73 d(-1) and 0.022 d(-1) for reactors A and a respectively, and
   the average observed biomass yield coefficient was 0.38 (reactor A) and
   0.21 (reactor B). The model infered the evolution of the COD and MLSS
   with a fairly good accuracy, proving that the method used to obtain the
   parameters does not have internal inconsistencies and may be used in
   other situations.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium dioxide mediated photocatalytic oxidation of Monocrotophos
   (MCP) was studied under different conditions. At a flow rate of 30
   ml/min and initial concentration of 50 mM, 51\% of MCP was found to
   degrade after an hour. When small amounts of either oxygen or hydrogen
   peroxide was added to the system, the degradation was enhanced
   significantly. Changes in the rates of MCP degradation were studied with
   the addition of chloride, chlorate, nitrate, sulphate, and copper ions
   to the recirculating solutions. The addition of anions can cause either
   an increase or a decrease in the photocatalytic oxidation of MCP,
   depending on the type of anions used. Whereas chloride, chlorate, and
   nitrate were demonstrated to hinder the degradation of MCP, sulphate was
   found to have an enhancement effect. The behaviour of Cu2+ ions was
   shown to have different effects on the photocatalytic degradation of
   MCP. It depends on the concentration of Cu2+ ion added during the
   reaction. At low concentrations (<10(-5) M) an enhancement in the
   degradation was found. However, at higher Cu2+ concentrations, a
   dramatic lowering of the rate of degradation was observed. Fourier
   Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) indicated that different
   intermediates were formed during the photocatalytic oxidation of MCP.
   These intermediates were also degraded with prolonged reaction.}},

Abstract = {{It is well documented that synthetic chlorinated hydrocarbon residues
   are widespread through the oceanic ecosystem. The Adriatic Sea, as a
   semi-enclosed body of water, is of special interest for an evaluation of
   the entry, extent and fate of the pollution by chlorinated hydrocarbons.
   An investigation of levels of chlorinated hydrocarbons in mussels in the
   eastern Adriatic coastal waters, off Croatia was performed. Samples were
   collected between 1972 and 1992 at a large number of stations. All these
   samples were analyzed by a single analytical group (mostly by the same
   analyst), using a uniform methodology which inter calibrated during
   seven international inter-calibration exercises. Mass fractions of
   chlorinated insecticides and polychlorinated biphenyls in mussels ranged
   from ND (<0.1) to 107.3 for DDT's and from ND (<0.5) to 1072 x 10(9) wet
   weight for PCBs and from 19 to 35,600 for DDT's and from 52 to 103.000 x
   10(9) on an extracted organic matter basis. Averages and ranges of
   chlorinated hydrocarbons mass fractions in mussels from the Adriatic are
   compared with the data of mussels obtained in other Mediterranean areas.
   In all four investigated areas of the Mediterranean (II, IV, VI, and
   VIII) DDT total mass fractions in mussel are higher than those for the
   Adriatic. In areas (II, IV, and VIII) the PCB values are higher compared
   to the Adriatic. Linear regression analysis of pollutant mass fractions
   in the mussel samples from the eastern Adriatic coastal waters collected
   during the 20-year period with the years of collection show that a
   statistically significant negative correlation coefficient is obtained
   by comparing the values of total DDT mass fractions. For PCBs, a slight
   negative correlation coefficient is obtained but it is not statistically
   significant. In the Pula area this correlation coefficient is positive,
   but it is also statistically non-significant.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of reactive co-substrates such as guaiacol and
   2,6-dimethoxyphenol on the removal of chlorinated phenols by horseradish
   peroxidase (HRP) and a laccase from the fungus Trametes versicolor was
   investigated. Addition of 50 mM guaiacol enhanced the precipitation of
   4-chlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, and 2,4,5-trichlorophenol with
   peroxidase by 12, 32 and 65\%, respectively, and with laccase by 20, 32
   and 80\%, respectively. Addition of 10 mM 2,6-dimethoxyphenol enhanced
   the precipitation of 2,4.5-trichlorophenol by 90\% with peroxidase and
   by 98\% with laccase. Products from the reaction of 2,6-dimethoxyphenol
   and peroxidase were filtered to exclude compounds of a molecular weight
   greater than 500. Incubation of the resulting enzyme-free filtrate with
   a solution of unreacted 2,4,5-trichlorophenol caused precipitation and a
   72\% removal of the 2,4,5-trichlorophenol. Chlorophenol precipitation in
   the presence of co-substrates may be a useful strategy for improving the
   efficiency of enzymatic decontamination methods, particularly in the
   case of heterogeneous pollution.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to study the biodegradability of
   ethylene glycol, acrylic acid. acrolein and allyl alcohol using a
   methanogenic acetate enrichment culture. Anaerobic Toxicity Assays (ATA)
   and Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP) studies were performed with
   serum bottles. Ethylene glycol was found to be degraded to less than 5
   mg/l with spikes up to 10,000 mg/l. Higher concentrations led to pH
   inhibition even with a design initial bicarbonate alkalinity of 6000
   mg/l as CaCO3. Acrylic acid was degraded with almost no effect on
   methanogens with spikes up to 100 mg/l. However, concentrations of 500,
   1000 and 1500 mg/l were found to inhibit the methanogens for several
   days before recovery. Acrylic acid was eventually degraded to less than
   1 mg/l in all cases. Acrolein was inhibitory at concentrations as low as
   10 mg/l. However, recovery of the culture was observed at concentrations
   up to 150 mg/l. Allyl alcohol was cometabolized when acetate was
   supplied to the bottles in the ATA; it was not degraded well when
   supplied as the sole carbon source in the BMP study. Ethylene glycol and
   acrylic acid were found to be suitable for anaerobic treatment whereas
   allyl alcohol and acrolein were not suitable at the selected
   concentrations using a methanogenic culture.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes investigations into the role that biotic and abiotic
   mechanisms play in the manganese redox cycle in a freshwater dam over a
   twelve month period. Enzymatic control of manganese oxidation was taking
   place with a temperature optimum of approx. 30 degrees C. Manganese
   oxidation was only significant above about 19 degrees C. The temperature
   and season play vital roles in determining the extent to which abiotic
   and microbial mechanisms contribute to manganese oxidation. Results
   showed that microbial catalysis is overwhelmingly responsible for
   manganese oxidation in the lower epilimnion from November to May.
   Significant abiotic catalysis (up to 25\%) can occur in late
   summer/autumn when the water temperature is greatest. Mn(II) oxidation,
   pseudo-first order rate constants to 1.12 x 10(22) M(-4). d(-1) were
   measured while poisoned sample experiments confirmed the role of
   biological mediation. In winter, biological control could not occur
   because of the lower temperature of the water column. The measurement of
   `'x'' in MnOx showed that higher manganese oxidation states were
   expected when the manganese oxidation rate was at a maximum and
   therefore when microbial activity was greatest. Direct microbial
   reduction of MnOx in the water column was of much less significance.
   However, indirect reduction may have taken place through the reaction of
   MnOx with sulfide. The results of this work have important implications
   for the design and operation of artificial destratification units for
   the control of manganese speciation.}},

Abstract = {{A method for the determination of ammonium in seawater is described, The
   method is based on the indophenol (or the Berthelot) reaction with
   o-phenylphenol {[}(1,1'-biphenyl)-2-ol, abbreviated as OPP] as an
   alternative of phenol. Unlike phenol, OPP is available as stable flaky
   crystal with no caustic odor. This nature of OPP can eliminate much of
   the inconvenience associated with the use of phenol. The sensitivity of
   detection is comparable to that of the common phenol-based methods. The
   indophenolic compound obtained from the reaction with OPP is more
   hydrophobic than that from the reaction with phenol. Thus the
   indophenolic compound can be extracted directly from the alkaline
   reaction solution of the present method either with organic solvent or
   with reversed-phase column. The extracted indophenol can be used to
   recover ammonium nitrogen for the determination of 15-N isotope ratio.
   The experimental procedure of the extraction of indophenolic compound is
   relatively simple compared to the other existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{To gain understanding of nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics in Lake
   Okeechobee, Florida, we developed and applied a deterministic, mass
   balance, water quality model at the whole-lake spatial scale. The model
   was calibrated to a comprehensive set of field data for 1985-1986, and
   then used to simulate the period 1973-1992. The model represented the
   mean behavior of in-lake total phosphorus, dissolved available
   phosphorus, total nitrogen and chlorophyll a concentrations reasonably
   well during the calibration period. The model did not represent
   dissolved available nitrogen concentrations very well, nor did it
   capture much of the observed temporal variability during the calibration
   period. The model results identified important information needs to
   improve our understanding of the nitrogen cycle including,
   sediment-water nitrogen fluxes, denitrification and nitrogen fixation.
   Results from the 1973-1992 simulation indicated that model assumptions
   and/or calibration parameters were not uniformly applicable over this
   period. Total phosphorus concentration results from this model were
   compared with results from two site-specific, empirical loading models
   for the lake. None of these models represented annual average
   concentrations uniformly well over the entire 20-year period, and none
   captured much of the observed inter-annual variability. External total
   phosphorus loadings and lake hydrology are not sufficient to fully
   describe total phosphorus dynamics in Lake Okeechobee. Other important
   factors are diffusive sediment-water fluxes, wind-induced sediment
   resuspension, and the spatial heterogeneity in the lake.}},

Abstract = {{A deterministic mass balance model for nutrient and phytoplankton
   dynamics was previously developed and calibrated to a comprehensive set
   of field data for Lake Okeechobee. In the present study, diagnostic and
   sensitivity analyses were conducted with the calibrated model to better
   understand factors controlling phytoplankton and load-response dynamics
   in the lake. Phytoplankton growth rate limitation due to underwater
   light attenuation appears to be substantially greater than growth rate
   limitation due to non-optimal phosphorus concentrations. Phytoplankton
   biomass appears strongly controlled by the supply rate of dissolved
   available phosphorus to the water column. The dynamics of total
   phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations in the lake are strongly
   influenced by sediment-water phosphorus fluxes. There is a wide range of
   uncertainty in responses of total phosphorus and chlorophyll a
   concentrations to changes in tributary phosphorus loadings. Much of this
   uncertainty is due to a lack of quantitative understanding of sediment
   responses to changes in tributary loadings. Other important factors are
   inter-annual variability in hydrometeorological conditions and the
   potential influence of wind-induced resuspension of particulate
   phosphorus. Responses of total phosphorus and chlorophyll a
   concentrations for a given change in tributary loading depend not only
   on the magnitide of the loading change, but also on the time frame after
   the loading change due to a lag in sediment response. Load-response
   predictions for Lake Okeechobee must lake into account changes in
   available phosphorus loadings to the water column, and must be premised
   on assumptions for changes in internal phosphorus loadings from the
   sediments. Results from this preliminary modeling analysis are
   provisional in that they do not include potential nitrogen limitation,
   potential interactions between phosphorus and nitrogen, or phytoplankton
   responses to potential nitrogen fixation.}},

Abstract = {{High loading denitrification was studied using granular activated carbon
   (Calgon Filtrasorb 400, size: 0.8-1.4 mm) column with injecting carbon
   source (sucrose) only once a day. Under the condition of EBCT (empty bed
   contact time) = 80 min, C:N ratio = 1.88, once per day injection mode of
   organic supply was able to sustain an average denitrification efficiency
   of 84 to 89\% even with influent NO3-N concentration of 80 mgl(-1). With
   an influent NO3-N of 20 mgl(-1) and C:N ratio of 1.88, however,
   reduction of EBCT to 20 min resulted in very poor denitrification. In
   the latter case, 46\% of the added carbon was lost in the effluent
   immediately after the injection. Short EBCT critically affected the
   process mainly due to insufficient adsorption rate. Microbial
   denitrification capability and fermentation might also limit the
   process. Extended organic injection is a possible option to improve the
   process efficiency. Occurrence of the sulfate reduction was limited in
   early phase of the cycle.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a study in which a battery of in situ bioassays was
   used to assess water quality in an agricultural catchment. The main aim
   of the study was to test whether experimental bioassays could provide
   information that complemented more traditional macroinvertebrate and
   chemical monitoring techniques. Two environmental quality assessments
   were undertaken in Curtisden Green Stream during 1992-1993, using
   macroinvertebrate monitoring techniques (hand nets or standard
   colonization units) and the following bioassays: Gammarus pules (L.)
   mortality and feeding rate, Anodonta cygnaea (L.)
   glutathione-S-transferase activity and Chironomus riparius (Meigen)
   emergence from sediment. The G. pulex and C. riparius assays provided
   useful information that complemented the macroinvertebrate survey data.
   The results revealed a system prone to considerable temporal and spatial
   variability in macroinvertebrate richness and abundance. Stretches of
   the stream that were consistently taxon-poor made it difficult to assess
   the effect of contamination using macroinvertebrate community monitoring
   alone. The experimental bioassays were able to identify particular
   stretches of the stream where pollution had occurred.}},

Abstract = {{Sonication, staining and the analysis of extracellular polymers (ECP)
   were used to examine the structure of granules from pilot-scale and
   laboratory-scale anaerobic upflow sludge blanket reactors. The
   pilot-scale unit was part of the SERC Anaerobic Facility which was
   treating the liquors from the manufacture of instant coffee. The
   laboratory-scale reactors used a chemically defined substrate. The
   results showed that, although the strength of the granules from the
   pilot-plant, as measured by the effect of sonication, varied with time,
   the variations could not be related to the microbial composition of the
   granules. However, it was found that the granules tended to become
   weaker as the organic load increased and the ECP from weak granules had
   a lower polysaccharide content. The effect of inhibitory agents
   (pyrogallol and coffee oil) on granule structure was also examined.
   These studies showed that the effect was to reduce the strength of the
   granules.}},

Abstract = {{The sorption of Cu(II) was investigated on synthetic humus-kaolin
   complexes. Two groups of humic fractions were compared to investigate
   the effect of molar mass on the Cu(II) adsorption capacity. Another
   approach was to compare the capacities of humic acid (HA) and fulvic
   acid (FA) to adsorb Cu(II). The adsorption capacity of fulvic acid on
   kaolin is smaller than that of humic acid. The adsorption behavior of
   fulvic acid on kaolin can be described by a Langmuir-type isotherm.
   However, the adsorption isotherm of humic acid on kaolin exhibits
   non-langmuir behavior. The results showed the affinity of Cu(II) on
   humic acid was greater than by fulvic acid. However, the affinity of
   Cu(II) adsorption by humic acid with large molar mass was equal to that
   by humic acid with small molar mass. A modified model incorporating a
   proton competition coefficient can differentiate the competitive effect
   from Cu(II) adsorption. A constant (K-m) independent of pH was derived
   from this model. HA-Kaolin complex has a greater Cu(II) affinity
   constant that FA-Kaolin complex according to models with either a
   single-site or a continuous distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Immobilization of Acinetobacter cells can provide a method which could
   possibly be used to explain the mechanism of biological phosphorus
   removal from AS systems since this may allow the study of pure cultures
   in their natural habitat. Pure cultures of Acinetobacter johnsonii and
   Acinetobacter calcoaceticus cells were therefore immobilized within
   alginate beads (3\% and 3.5\% alginate) to assess their behaviour and
   particularly, their survival, leakage, growth and phosphate uptake
   abilities. Both species survived immobilization conditions, however, the
   effects on viability, leakage rate, growth and phosphate uptake were
   dependent upon the alginate concentration and the strain.
   Notwithstanding leakage, cell densities within alginate beads over 24 h
   were higher than initial densities due to growth. The growth rate of A.
   calcoaceticus immobilized cells was twice that of free cells, while A.
   johnsonii showed similar growth rates between immobilized and free
   cells. Non growing immobilized cells showed higher phosphate uptake
   ability than growing cells. After 24 h, A. calcoaceticus immobilized
   cells removed more phosphate per cell than A. johnsonii cells while both
   species showed higher phosphate uptake ability when immobilized in 3\%

Abstract = {{Batch studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of environmental
   factors on the rate of Cr(VI) reduction by two organisms, Bacillus sp.
   (a new isolate), and Pseudomonas fluorescens LB 300. Both organisms
   utilized glucose for Cr(VI) reduction under aerobic conditions. Higher
   Cr(VI) reduction rates were obtained with higher initial cell
   concentrations, but the specific rate (normalized against initial cell
   concentration), was higher at lower initial cell concentrations. The
   rate of Cr(VI) reduction by Bacillus sp. increased with initial Cr(VI)
   concentrations ranging from 20 to 70 mg/l and decreased at higher
   concentrations. The rate of Cr(VI) reduction by LB 300 steadily
   increased with the initial Cr(VI) concentrations over the entire test
   range of 20-100 mg/l Cr(VI). Further studies with the new isolate,
   Bacillus sp., showed that neither sulfate nor nitrate affected Cr(VI)
   reduction. Also no correlations were found between the rate of Cr(VI)
   reduction and the redox potential of culture media. Experiments with
   cell-free extracts of Bacillus sp. indicated that soluble type of
   enzymes were responsible for Cr(VI) reduction in this organism.}},

Abstract = {{A simple model that predicts oxygen transfer in hypolimnetic aerators is
   described. The model accounts for cocurrent flow of air and water,
   variation of the saturated aqueous oxygen concentration with depth, and
   depletion of oxygen in the gas-phase. A correlation for water flow rate
   is developed from literature data, while existing correlation equations
   are used to estimate the mass transfer coefficient. Published
   experimental data for water flow rate and oxygen transfer are used for
   model validation with most of the observed data being predicted to
   within +/- 30\%. Equations are provided for estimating the extent of the
   oxygenated zone-of-influence for an aerator operating in relatively
   stagnant water or a uniform underflow current. The potential
   deterioration in aerator performance due to short-circuiting of
   oxygenated water is briefly discussed. The model represents a
   substantial improvement in understanding of oxygen transfer in
   hypolimnetic aerators. It should be useful in the preliminary design and
   economic optimization of hypolimnetic aeration systems, and in
   determining spacing requirements for aerators in a lake or reservoir
   when more than one aerator is installed.}},

Abstract = {{The inactivation rates of indigenous populations of fecal coliforms,
   enterococci, Clostridium perfringens, male-specific bacteriophage and
   somatic coliphage in secondary sewage effluents were compared using
   chlorine and ozone as disinfecting agents. The fecal coliform indicator
   was evaluated for its reliability to index viral responses to chlorine
   and ozone treatments in fecally polluted effluents. Effluents were
   collected from several wastewater treatment plants during a variety of
   meteorological conditions and exhibited a wide range in quality. In
   chlorinated effluent, a greater than 100-fold reduction in both fecal
   coliform and enterococci densities was observed. However, densities of
   the two bacteriophage groups were generally reduced less than IO-fold.
   In contrast, ozone treatments resulted in the inactivation of bacterial
   viruses, with more than 100-fold reductions of male-specific and somatic
   bacteriophage densities. The elimination of vegetative bacteria was less
   dramatic in ozonated effluents with less than a 30-fold reduction in the
   densities of both of these indicators. C. perfringens was relatively
   insensitive to inactivation by either disinfectant; populations of this
   indicator were stable for prolonged contact periods. These findings
   demonstrate that the fecal coliform indicator is inadequate for
   predicting viral responses to chlorine or ozone treatments. Ozone
   contact time and residual concentrations were increased appreciably in
   later trials to further determine the sensitivities of fecal coliforms
   and enterococci to this treatment. However, increasing these parameters,
   alone or in concert, did not enhance the rates at which vegetative
   bacterial populations declined.}},

Title = {{MODELING THE KINETICS OF BIODEGRADATION OF ANIONIC SURFACTANTS BY
   BIOFILM BACTERIA FROM POLLUTED RIVERINE SITES - A COMPARISON OF 5
   CLASSES OF SURFACTANT AT 3 SITES}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{The capacity of epilithic bacteria from different riverine sires to
   biodegrade representatives of five classes of anionic surfactants, was
   quantified by analysis of biodegradation kinetics in die-away tests. The
   sampling sites in the River fly, South Wales were located near a sewage
   treatment plant outfall. Indigenous stones from the riverbed were
   removed from sires immediately beneath the outfall(BO), and at sites 15
   m upstream (BU) and 50 m downstream (ED). The five surfactants used were
   sodium dodecyl sulphate (representing primary linear alkyl sulphates,
   PLAS), Empicol(k) ESB3/S (alkyl ethoxy sulphates, AES), potassium
   undecyl-2-sulphate (secondary linear alkyl sulphates. SLAS), sodium
   l-dodecane sulphonate (primary alkane sulphonates, PA Sigma) and
   5-phenyl dodecane sulphonate (linear alkyl benzene sulphonates, LAB
   Sigma). Irrespective of sampling site, the order of biodegradability
   assessed as the reciprocal of half-time for surfactant disappearance was
   PLAS > AES > SLAS > PAC > LAB Sigma. Within each surfactant class, the
   half-time decreased in the order BU > ED > BO. Non-linear regression
   analysis of the die-away data to several kinetic models which combined
   disappearance of surfactant by zero. first order or Michaelis-Menten
   kinetics, with growth (exponential or logistic) of competent cells,
   yielded as best fit the model involving exponential growth of competent
   cells with first-order disappearance of substrate. This model generated
   two biologically-significant parameters: K-1 which is equivalent to
   first-order rate constant in the die-away test at t = 0 (i.e, before
   growth distorts the population from its indigenous composition); and r,
   the specific growth rate of the biodegrading population in the die-away
   flask. For a given site, K-1 decreased in the order PLAS > AES > SLAS >
   PAC > LAB Sigma, reflecting their relative biodegradability. Values of r
   for the primary sulphate esters (PLAS and AES) were always greater than
   values for the other surfactants, especially the sulphonates (PA Sigma
   and LAB Sigma), indicating that different sub-populations existed for
   the biodegradation of these classes. Moreover, lack of inter-site
   variation in this pattern Suggested similar distributions of
   surfactant-biodegrading populations at each site. Values of
   \{K-1\textbackslash{}viable-cell count\}, which is a measure of
   surfactant-biodegrading activity per unit of population, fell into two
   groups: higher values (i.e. r 10(-9) h(-1) cfu(-1) ml) with little
   inter-site variation ( similar to 3-fold) for sulphated surfactants, and
   lower values(mostly < 10(-10) h(-1) cfu(-1) ml) with much greater
   inter-site variation ( > 30-fold) for sulphonates. These results
   indicated that the capacity to biodegrade sulphated surfactants was more
   widely distributed in bacteria than was the capacity to biodegrade
   sulphonates. This situation may have evolved as a result of selective
   pressure from exposure of bacteria to environments in which natural
   analogues of sulphated surfactants, but not of aryl sulphonates or LAB
   Sigma, are commonly present.}},

Abstract = {{Flocs/aggregates can comprise a significant proportion of the total
   volume of suspended sediment in the fluvial environment. In situ
   measurement of the effective size distribution is frequently precluded
   on grounds of the cost of appropriate equipment or adverse field
   conditions. An assessment of the potential for using an alternative and
   simpler strategy involving collection of bottle samples and subsequent
   analysis of the samples has been undertaken. A field-portable,
   laser-backscatter particle size analyser has been used to assess the
   representativeness of measurements made on-site immediately after sample
   collection, and subsequently in the laboratory after settling and
   resuspension. On-site measurements of bottle samples were broadly
   representative of the in situ effective size distribution. Flocculation
   occurred within settled samples together with a concomitant increase in
   the volume mean particle size upon resuspension. The magnitude of this
   increase was, in general, positively related to settling time. Following
   resuspension, flee break-up during continuous stirring caused mean
   particle size to decline towards the initial on-site value.}},

   facultative and maturation ponds, relate either BOD removal or the
   removal of faecal coliform organisms to a number of environmental and
   other parameters. For the facultative ponds BOD removal was principally
   influenced by not only loading and retention time but also by solar
   radiation and hours of sunshine, rainfall and pond depth. On the other
   hand, loading, retention time, pond depth and the wastewater electrical
   conductivity were the principal factors influencing FC removal. In the
   maturation ponds faecal coliform removal was influenced by the same
   parameters as for the facultative ponds but with BOD removal neither
   pond depth nor rainfall appeared to be of any importance.}},

Abstract = {{A mixture of sodium alginate and sodium polystyrenesulfonate (NaPSS) was
   used as the absorbent for copper in this work. A viscous solution of the
   mixture was dispensed into a copper-containing solution circulating in a
   loop fluidized bed reactor to form alginate gel in situ. Batch
   absorption data was treated by Langmuir model to yield copper binding
   capacity and binding stability constant. Results were compared with
   those of our previous work in which no NaPSS was added to Na-alginate.
   Based on the Langmuir parameters, the critical copper concentration
   above which the addition of NaPSS can enhance the copper loading of the
   alginate gel was calculated. The ratio of copper loading of the alginate
   gel with the addition of NaPSS to that without the addition of NaPSS at
   any copper concentration was predicted as well. Similar calculations
   were made for the case of using the mixture of Na-alginate and
   Microcystis as the copper absorbent.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of onsite
   aerobic package treatment systems (APTS), and to suggest operational and
   design modifications. In the first phase, five APTS in southwest
   Virginia were found to be operating poorly (average BODs = 69.4 mg/l,
   TSS = 99 mg/l, TKN = 18.6 mg/l), often violating Virginia effluent
   standards. Mechanical failures, improper maintenance and design were
   identified as causing the poor performance. In the second phase,
   excessive hydraulic retention time (HRT) in held systems (over 3 days)
   was identified as a significant design problem. Laboratory systems
   operating with aeration basin HRTs of 0.5 to 2 days produced better
   effluent quality (average BODs = 19 mg/l, TSS = 29 mg/l, TKN = 0.7
   mg/l). In a separate experiment relatively high levels of laundry
   detergent did not significantly affect laboratory system performance.
   Finally, a field experiment was conducted to determine the effect of
   equalizing washing machine how on the operation of an APTS. An
   improvement in system performance and stability was observed. Based on
   these studies, potential design and operational modifications are
   suggested, including improved maintenance, reduction of aeration basin
   HRT, and equalization of wastewater flow.}},

Abstract = {{The enteric adenoviruses types 40 (Ead 40) and 41 (Ead 41) have emerged
   as a leading cause of viral gastroenteritis in children, second in

   as waterborne pathogens has not been evaluated. This study compared the
   survival of these agents with poliovirus type 1 (polio 1) and the
   hepatitis A virus (HAV) in tap water at 4 degrees C, and at room
   temperature, with polio 1 in primary and secondary wastewater at 4, and
   15 degrees C, and in sea water at 15 degrees C. Assays were conducted at
   regular intervals by the TCID50 method in PLC/PRF/5 cells. The survival
   of Ead 40 and Ead 41 in primary and secondary wastewater was slightly
   greater than that of polio 1. However, in tap, and sea water, the
   enteric adenoviruses were substantially more stable than either polio 1
   or HAV. These results suggest that the enteric adenoviruses may survive
   for prolonged periods in water, representing a potential route of

Abstract = {{The enteric adenovirus types 40 (Ead 40) and 41 (Ead 41) are the second
   most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in children. Since their
   occurrence in the aquatic environment is unknown, their role as
   waterborne pathogens has not been determined. This study evaluated the
   ability of electronegative microporous filters to recover Ead 40 from
   tap water, secondary treated sewage, and artificial and natural sea
   waters, and the ability of electropositive microporous filters to
   recover Ead 40 from tap water. The efficiency of organic flocculation
   and PEG precipitation to reconcentrate Ead 40 from beef extract eluents
   was also assessed. Viral assays were conducted by the TCID50 method in
   PLC/PRF/5 cells. With electronegative filters, recovery efficiencies of
   36, 38, and 22\% were obtained from 113-1. volumes of tap, sea water,
   and secondary sewage, respectively, using electropositive filters Ead 40
   was recovered from tap water, with an efficiency of 26.5\%. No
   significant difference was observed, by paired t-test analysis, when
   comparing the concentration efficiencies between organic flocculation
   (38.6\%), and PEG precipitation (40\%). These results show that Ead 40
   can be concentrated from water samples, with efficiencies comparable to
   other enteric viruses.}},

Abstract = {{Activated sludge settling properties can be characterised with two
   time-varying parameters. A simple method is presented for online
   identification of these parameters. The method is obtained as an exact
   solution of the filtration problem; it is obtained on the basis of the
   settling process description and the parameters variation process
   description. The method is suitable for practical application. It is a
   more exact solution of the identification problem than the alternative
   regression analysis method. An easily implementable system is proposed
   for automatic characterisation of the sludge settling properties.}},

Abstract = {{The ionic conductivity of an enhanced biological phosphorus removing
   (EBPR) sludge shows a clear behavior during the non-aerated phase. It
   decreases during denitrification and increases under anaerobic
   conditions proportionally to the phosphate concentration. The absolute
   value of this increase related to the release of phosphorus was
   determined between 1.66 x 10(-4) to 1.99 x 10(-4) S m(2)g(p)(-1) (at 293
   K and an ionic strength of about 650 x 10(-4) S m(-1)). Theoretical
   calculations are in good agreement with these results. Potassium,
   magnesium, calcium and phosphate show a positive, whereas acetate and pH
   show a negative correlation to the ionic conductivity. This method is an
   easy and inexpensive in-line method providing more information about
   phosphorus release. Under some circumstances (low salinity, sequencing
   batch reactor) it may be used to estimate the anaerobic increase of
   phosphorus concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Biofilm composition and activity are two important parameters for the
   successful operation and control of fixed film processes in water and
   wastewater treatment. Widely used parameters for biofilm
   characterization are biofilm thickness, total dry weight and total cell
   count, These parameters are, however not sufficient to describe biofilm
   activity. Improved analytical methods and procedures are needed in order
   to understand the physiological behaviour of the fixed biomass. Common
   methods used to analyse biofilms are critically reviewed in terms of
   their principle, complexity, reproducibility, sensitivity and cost.
   Conventional and advanced analytical methods are classified in three
   main categories: (1) biofilm formation and structure; (2) biofilm
   composition described in terms of total biofilm amount, specific biofilm
   components and cellular components; and (3) biomass activity
   descriptors. The discussion focused on the potential of these methods
   for accurate biofilm characterization and biomass activity estimation in
   fundamental research and for the practical needs of wastewater treatment
   operation and control.}},

Abstract = {{In open channels, the transition from a rapid to fluvial flow is called
   a hydraulic jump. It is characterized by large scale turbulence, air
   bubble entrainment and energy dissipation. The author has investigated
   the air bubble entrainment at hydraulic jumps with partially developed
   inflow conditions. The air-water flow is characterized by a turbulent
   shear region with a large air content which contributes to the
   enhancement of the air-water interface area and air-water gas transfer
   in the hydraulic jump. A new gas transfer model is presented. Based upon
   physical evidence, the model enables prediction of the dissolved gas
   contents and water quality downstream of hydraulic jumps with partially
   developed inflows.}},

Abstract = {{The phytoplankton and zooplankton populations of a series of temperate
   region waste stabilization ponds treating dairy effluent were studied
   over a period of 17 months. The system was organically overloaded. The
   phytoplankton consisted almost entirely of small, round to oval
   Chlorococcales (dominated, most probably, by one or more species of
   Chlorella), with densities of up to ca. 8 million cells per ml. The
   metazoan zooplankton was dominated by the rotifer Brachionus
   calyciflorus, in high abundances (commonly ca. 25,000, and up to ca.
   160,000 individuals per litre) during the summer months, in the later
   ponds. Daphnia magna, a zooplankter previously dominant in the system,
   was not recorded, this was most probably due to the high organic
   loading. Despite high rotifer densities, the phytoplankton populations
   and suspended solids were not reduced to low levels by grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Standard evaluation procedures of hazardous chemicals in the environment
   are not able to identify mechanisms of alterations of potentially
   harmful effects, for example in the presence of organic geochemical
   matrices. By including aquatic humic substances into standard Daphnia
   and fish tests we found that the bioconcentration of organic chemicals
   is reduced in many instances. Furthermore, decreases as well as
   increases in toxicity of substituted phenols and anilines can occur.
   Some environmental chemical mechanisms that can alter the toxicity of
   parent compounds are discussed, but the mechanisms are not yet
   identified. At present, there does not appear to exist a common
   mechanism for the alteration of toxicity. As a consequence, techniques
   of comparative analysis of adverse effects should be applied on a
   phenomenological basis. An appropriate technique is based on
   Hasse-diagrams, which are graphical presentations of so-called partially
   ordered sets, Such a generalized order is necessary, if for example
   chemicals are to be described by more than one characteristic quantity.
   In the methodological section, the Hasse-diagram technique is explained
   in detail with exposure data of a German river. A very simple
   deterministic model, EXWAT, is applied to get a set of scores for each
   of nineteen chemicals found during measurements in the River Main. By
   EXWAT the environmental fate of these chemicals is described by four
   descriptors. The Hasse-diagram shows that there are Four classes of
   chemicals that have a different pattern of their fate-descriptors and
   have the highest priority with respect to environmental impact. Examples
   of how to read Hasse-diagrams are given. This technique, however, is not
   limited to exposure data only, but can also be successfully applied to
   effect data as well as to a combination of exposure and effect data. The
   application to effect data will be demonstrated with the above-mentioned
   data on humic substances mediated alterations of xenobiotics toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the impact of biological
   parameters on the overall performance of a biological denitrification
   process. A method for evaluating the metabolic activity of the
   microorganisms was developed based on measuring nitrogen production
   rate. The method was found to be particularly valuable in monitoring
   batch and continuous-flow processes and confirmed the existence of
   several phases in denitrification. Nitrate and organic overload imposed
   upon the denitrification process were Found to be well reflected by the
   gas production rate, but did not have a significant long-term impact on
   the denitrification performance of the process. The influence of pH on
   the denitrification performance was studied. The results showed that the
   specific activity of adapted denitrifying microorganisms was not
   affected by a modification of the pH control set-point. However, it was
   also found that small (+/-0.5 unit), short-term variations in the pH
   control set-point affect the performance of non-adapted denitrifying
   micro-organisms.}},

Abstract = {{We performed a controlled evaluation of ultraviolet light irradiation of
   hot and cold water supplies in a hospital colonized with Legionella by
   inserting the u.v. units near the `'point-of-use''. Showers on one wing
   of a hospital were supplied with u.v.-irradiated water. Showers on
   another wing and 20 other outlets served as controls. Cultures prior to
   the installation of u.v. units showed all outlets to be heavily
   colonized with L. pneumophila. Despite disinfection of incoming water by
   u.v., Legionella in established niches of the plumbing system continued
   to survive. Superheat/flush and chlorination was then applied prior to
   u.v. activation. Although cultures became negative initially,
   recolonization occurred after 1 month. Scale accumulation on u.v. lamps
   had compromised the efficacy of u.v. irradiation. Filters were added to
   prevent scale accumulation on the u.v. lamps and the u.v.-supplied
   showers remained Legionella-free. U.V. plus prefiltration can prevent
   Legionella recolonization for at least 4 months after disinfection if
   the u.v. units are installed near the `'point-of-use''. Disinfection
   must be directed not only at incoming water, but also at established
   niches within the existing plumbing system. The advantages of u.v.
   include easy installation, low expense, and no adverse effects on water
   or plumbing.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study for combined stabilization and dewatering of
   industrial wastewater was carried out by means of a microfiltration unit
   inside a bioreactor. The module type used was a hollow fiber membrane
   with a transport area of 0.3 m(2) and pore size of 0.1 mu m. The
   membrane material was polyethylene. Dewatering was accomplished by
   applying suction pressure across the membrane. Four suction pressures in
   short-term experiments with activated sludge from the Barceloneta
   Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (BRWTP) were studied. The objective
   here was to determine the membrane hydraulic characteristics and the
   best conditions for stable, long-term operation. The experiments showed
   that the flux through the membrane decreases with vacuum pressures
   greater than 60 kPa owing to rapid clogging of the membrane micropores.
   Long-term experiments of 62 days duration were carried out with a
   pharmaceutical wastewater at a suction pressure of 20 kPa. Parameters
   measured included COD, MLSS, and MLVSS. The operation mode was
   intermittent with cycle time of 20 min: 4 min of suction followed by 16
   min without suction, with average hydraulic retention time of 10.5 h.
   This mode of operation gave better and more stable results than
   continuous operation. The MLSS concentration inside the reactor
   increased throughout the operation, but was always under 40,000 mg/l,
   the limit for stable operation without sludge wastage. The average COD
   removal efficiency during the long-term experiments was 63\%, with a
   maximum value of 86\%.}},

Abstract = {{The widely reported accumulation of nitrite during nitrification is
   studied in recirculating fish culture systems. Nitrite oxidation
   capacity was homogeneously distributed over the trickling filter, as
   opposed to the ammonia oxidation capacity, which decreased at an
   increasing filter depth. Under all circumstances tested, nitrite
   accumulation in the system was restricted to an elevated but stable
   nitrite concentration, indicating complete oxidation of the produced
   nitrite. For a specific trickling filter, a fixed ratio between nitrite
   and ammonia concentrations in the recirculating water was found.
   Nitrifying biofilms maintaining relatively low nitrite concentrations
   were characterized by a relatively high nitrite oxidizing capacity
   compared to ammonia oxidizing capacity, whereas biofilms with a relative
   low nitrite oxidation capacity induced high nitrite concentrations. The
   occurrence of high nitrite concentrations in trickling filler effluents
   can entirely be explained by diffusional transport mechanisms in
   combination with the characteristics of the biofilm. There is no
   argument that high levels of nitrite nitrite are caused by insufficient
   activity or inhibition of the nitrite oxidation process.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of air
   superficial velocity (U-G) on biofilm growth in an aerobic three-phase
   fluidized-bed reactor. Spherical shape polymer particles (2.7 mm
   diameter and density of 1180 kg . m(-3)) were used as support material.
   The reactor influent was a synthetic wastewater, mainly composed of
   glucose, glycerine and meat extract (COD of about 180 mg . l(-1)) and
   reactor operation was carried out at an organic load of about 8 kg COD .
   m(-3). d(-1). The results indicate that biofilm accumulation decreases
   when gas superficial velocity increases in the range of 0-20 m . h(-1).
   However, COD removal efficiencies were practically independent of U-G,
   whereas biofilm characteristics were significantly affected by air
   superficial velocity.}},

   precursors. Three different PACs provided by manufacturers have been
   applied to water samples collected from the Po River (Turin, Italy) and
   a specific analytical approach based on precursors concentration and DBP
   formation potential was used for comparison and definition of
   selectivity. The influence of some operating variables on PAC efficiency
   has been evaluated for only one of the PACs previously examined: PAC
   dosage and contact time, ozonation, chlorine dioxide addition,

Abstract = {{The dissipation and loss of atrazine and metolachlor from field plots
   and an agricultural watershed were compared for scale factors related to
   dissipation and loss. The watershed and the field plots, located in
   southwestern Ontario, were planted with corn and cash crops associated
   in the watershed. The studied areas were plowed by conventional methods.
   The watershed has well-drained Guelph loam and Embro silt loam and the
   field plots has a poorly drained Brookston clay loam.
   Dissipation rates of atrazine and metolachlor in the surface runoff and
   tile drainage from the field plots were faster than in runoff from the
   agricultural watershed. The applied atrazine and metolachlor losses in
   combined surface and subsurface runoff, were respectively 1.81, 0.33,
   1.18 and 0.15\%, for field plots and the watershed.
   The ratios between the herbicide input rate and output rate of the
   watershed and of the field plot are 2.33 and 2.76 for atrazine and
   metolachlor, respectively. These ratios illustrate that herbicide loss
   is independent of spatial variations, Leading factors identified from
   the study to be considered for scale effect are, soil organic carbon,
   water table depth, soil moisture content, soil textures, antecedent
   days, and time after application.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents data related to the start-up of biological
   phosphorus removal in a plant exhibiting simultaneous nitrification and
   denitrification in the aerobic basin. No particular selection of
   bacterial species was observed during the start-up period, leading to
   the conclusion that the dephosphatation was carried out by the
   denitrifiers present in the sludge. The time necessary to promote
   phosphorus removal in the plant corresponded to about 2
   anaerobic-aerobic cycles of the sludge. The maximum removal rate of
   phosphorus was equal to 7 mg P g(-1) MLSS d(-1), resulting in the sludge
   containing about 10\% of phosphorus. Chemical speciation of phosphate
   fractions indicated that when no lime was added to the clarifier,
   organic phosphates contributed to 52\% of the phosphorus present in the
   sludge. The remaining 48\% is to be attributed to the process of
   co-precipitation. Dosing of lime caused a decrease in the polyphosphate
   fraction in the sludge and a simultaneous increase in the portion of
   other fractions. The conditions prior to lime addition were
   re-established within a few days of stopping the chemical dosing,
   indicating that the chemical process does not exert an irreversible
   influence on the enzymatic system of the biological luxury up-take.}},

   inhibition of methanogenesis and concentration in excess of 0.12 mg/l
   caused complete failure in serum bottles. Chemostats operated at a 15-d
   SRT and an organic loading rate of 500 mg-COD/l-d as acetic acid were
   spiked with slug doses of 50, 75 and 100 mg/l of cadmium. Ninety percent
   recovery of the chemostats was observed when the free cadmium was 0.1
   mg/l in the Cd-inhibited cultures in the chemostats. Based on these
   studies, a free Cd level of 0.1 mg/l appears to be a `'safe limit'' for
   acetate-utilizing methanogens.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the oxidation reactions of u.v. radiation/hydrogen
   peroxide/oxygen with either phenol or salicylic acid a spectra library
   was established. The reaction products contain hydroxylated phenols,
   benzoquinone and aliphatic acids with up to six carbon atoms. Many of
   the substances have been identified by means of chromatography and
   spectra comparison. From the observed concentrations of the substances
   and the known reaction mechanisms the following course of reaction has
   been postulated. The first reaction step is the hydroxylation of the
   aromatic ring. Further oxidation occurs via abstraction of a hydrogen
   atom to form 1,2-benzoquinone which is cleaved to form muconic acid. The
   cleavage of the muconic acid by u.v. radiation/hydrogen peroxide/oxygen
   leads to maleic acid, fumaric acid and oxalic acid. The degradation of
   oxalic acid leads to formic acid and finally to carbon dioxide. The
   hydroxylation of the double bond of the maleic or fumaric acid and the
   abstraction of a hydrogen atom produces malic acid. The reactions can be
   seen as essential step in the photochemical transformation of refractory
   substances into biodegradable ones.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen peroxide is used as a source of oxygen for enhanced
   bioremediation of contaminated subsurface environments and as an oxidant
   in engineered systems. While a number of aspects of hydrogen peroxide
   chemistry are well understood, the importance and relationship between
   hydrogen peroxide decomposition and contaminant degradation in the
   presence of subsurface materials is not clear. We report on batch and
   column studies examining this relationship using quinoline and a sandy
   aquifer material. The rate of hydrogen peroxide decomposition followed a
   simple first order relationship, but the loss of quinoline was much more
   complex than anticipated. The stoichiometric efficiency (i.e., the
   amount of quinoline degraded for a given loss in hydrogen peroxide)
   increased dramatically with decreasing concentration of aquifer
   material. Surface scavenging of reactive intermediates is believed to
   cause this unexpected behavior. This hypothesis was supported by
   increased quinoline removal after treatment to remove or inactivate
   catalytic sites. A model is proposed capable of predicting the extent of
   quinoline degradation as a function of the aquifer material solids
   concentration. The findings show that batch and column data for this
   system and perhaps others involving reactive intermediates must be
   interpreted with caution. Our results suggest that phosphate addition to
   retard hydrogen peroxide decomposition could increase contaminant
   degradation, previously attributed to only biological processes. It may
   also be possible to enhance chemical degradation in the subsurface and
   in engineered systems by addition of amendments to modify the surfaces
   and control reaction pathways.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed treatability study investigating metals removal from
   leachates collected from a sanitary landfill is presented, Experiments
   investigated treatment of raw leachate from younger and older zones of
   the landfill and of a mixture of the two leachates (representing an
   average leachate from the landfill). The metal concentrations and COD in
   leachate from the older area were approximately one order of magnitude
   greater than in leachate from the active area. The leachates contained
   significant quantities of reduced iron and manganese that, upon aeration
   and base addition, were precipitated and served as sorbents for trace
   metals that were present at much lower concentrations. Most trace metals
   in the younger zone leachate and in the leachate mixture were removed by
   adjusting solution pH to 9.0, but in leachates collected from the older
   landfill area, even raising the pH to 11.0 did not remove all the trace
   metals efficiently. Various options for treating a blend of leachate
   from the older and younger areas (20\% : 80\% by volume) were evaluated.
   One of the key design decisions was whether to aerate the leachate poor
   to pH adjustment. Trace metals could be removed efficiently from the
   leachate with or without aeration. Benefits of aeration include
   increased formation of iron oxide adsorbent and a significant reduction
   in the amount of base required to raise the pH, since aeration strips
   large amounts of CO2 from the leachates. Drawbacks include decreased
   sludge settleability and the cost of the aeration process itself. The
   settleability of the aerated sludge could be increased 5-10 fold by the
   addition of anionic polymer. Sludge produced was not toxic as determined
   by TCLP. Trade-offs implicit in these results are addressed both
   experimentally and theoretically.}},

Abstract = {{The surfactant-aided recoveries of polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) from a
   sample of Ashtabula River (Ohio) sediment were compared to calculated
   recoveries based on an equilibrium phase distribution model. The
   equilibrium model contains as parameters: (i) the surfactant
   concentration in the micelles, {[}S](mic), (ii) the mass of organic
   carbon in the sediment (or soil) per aqueous volume, oc, (iii) a
   constant characterizing solute affinity for the micelle (beta = and
   K-m/K-ow), and (iv) a constant characterizing solute affinity for the
   sediment carbon (alpha = K-oc/K-ow). The recovery of specific PCB
   congeners from the sediment by surfactant micelles at equilibrium were
   invariant with congener number as predicted by the model. This invariant
   behavior results from the fact that the PCBs are partitioned between two
   lipophilic phases (soil organic carbon and micelles) through hydrophobic
   interactions. Surfactants chosen as solubilizing agent were Brij 30,

Abstract = {{The effect of polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS) on bench-scale activated
   sludge reactors and pilot-scale anaerobic and aerobic digesters was
   investigated, and a mass balance was performed using radiolabeled PDMS.
   Polydimethylsiloxane loadings of up to 10,000 mg kg(-1) dry weight of
   MLVSS had no effect on the maximum specific substrate utilization rate,
   half-saturation constant, endogenous decay coefficient, and cell yield
   in model activated sludge units. In addition, the operating parameters
   pH, suspended solids, sludge volume index, and specific oxygen uptake
   rate showed no difference between PDMS-loaded and control systems. A
   mass balance, in which C-14-labeled PDMS was added to bench-scale
   activated sludge systems, showed that essentially ail of the PDMS
   partitioned onto the microbial biomass. Pilot-scale aerobic and
   anaerobic digesters loaded with 100 mg kg(-1) PDMS showed no difference
   in pH and solids concentrations compared to control systems. In
   addition, PDMS-loaded aerobic digesters exhibited oxygen uptake rates
   equal to control systems; PDMS-loaded anaerobic digesters produced the
   same amount of gas as control digesters. These results show that PDMS
   behaves as an inert material with no significant effect on wastewater
   treatment processes (other than the expected benefit of foam control).}},

Abstract = {{S. aureus and C. albicans have been proposed as alternative indicators
   in swimming pools, so the upgrade of methods for detection of these
   microorganisms can provide better assessment of pool water quality. A
   total of 136 water samples collected from 25 public swimming pools in
   the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil were analyzed concerning the sensitivity
   and specificity of culture media in the recovery of S. aureus and C.
   albicnns. For S. aureus, MF technique was applied, and five culture
   media were tested: Chapman-Stone, Chapman-mannitol, Baird-Parker,
   Vogel-Johnson and m-Staphylococcus agar. Typical colonies were
   characterized by catalase and coagulase activities and glucose and
   mannitol fermentation. Analysis of C. albicans was performed by
   quantitative (MF technique, m-CA agar) and qualitative (yeast nitrogen
   base glucose) procedures. Isolates from both procedures were
   characterized by germ tube and chlamydospore production and sugar
   assimilation. The superiority of m-CA agar with an accuracy level of
   89.6\% in C. albicans recovery was shown. In relation to S. aureus,
   Baird-Parker presented an increase in recovery from 5.7 to 17.2\% than
   the other media. However, none of the media tested were sufficiently
   differential to permit the accurate identification of S. aureus in
   swimming pool waters.}},

Abstract = {{Concerning the great importance of the safety of bathing water, and due
   to the dispute about the better microbiological indicator to assess the
   water quality of swimming pools, 1345 samples of water collected from 60
   swimming pools in a period of four years were analyzed for total (TC)
   and fecal coliforms (FC), fecal streptococci (FS), heterotrophic
   bacteria (HPC), S. aureus (Sa), C. albicans (Ca) and P. aeruginosa (Pa).
   The frequency of positive results for these indicators ranged up to
   70.4\% (HPC), 13.3\% (TC), 9.1\% (Sa), 7.7\% (FS), 5.6\% (FC) and 2.0\%
   (Pa and Ca). A correlation matrix (Spearman rank correlation) showed
   strong positive relationship among the levels of these microorganisms
   and between their densities and bather load and water temperature. As
   expected, all the microbiological variables presented a negative
   correlation with chlorine, C. albicans showing to be the more resistant
   to this disinfectant. Considering the good correlation among all these
   microbiological parameters, the highest rates of isolation of
   heterotrophic bacteria and total coliforms and the costs for
   microbiological analysis, it is possible to achieve an effective
   monitoring of swimming pool water quality by using only these two
   indicators, with no need of applying the other ones on a routine basis.
   P. aeruginosa and C. albicans, besides their high resistance to
   chlorine, presented a very low incidence and its use for evaluating
   swimming pool waters quality in routine is not indicated.}},

   is not only aesthetically undesirable, frequently imparting colour,

   colour from upland raw waters concomitantly converting the composite
   organic compounds to lower molecular weight, more biodegradable organic

   efficiencies of GAC filtration processes are generally improved due to
   enhanced biological removals, ozonation typically results in a

   Contributions from terrestrial vegetation, particularly Sphagnum moss,
   appear to dominate the distribution of n-alkanes, n-alkan-1-ols and
   sterols in the two water fractions. Pyrolytic contributions representing
   long-range transported polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) over the
   Scandinavian Peninsula are also observed. All biogenic compounds
   exhibit, in general, similar distribution coefficients between the two
   water phases (lg K-D: 4.9-5.7) which is in agreement with their common
   combination with organic materials of analogous hydrophobic/hydrophilic
   properties. PAH constitute the only group of compounds with phase
   distribution coefficients (lg K-D: 4.4-5.2) lower than the general
   interval. Finally, both in the case of the biogenic and the pyrolytic
   compounds, incorporation into the water column seems to be
   preferentially mediated by transport through the particulate phase.}},

Abstract = {{This paper details the results of research which examined the sorption
   characteristics of a forest soil profile for phosphorus (P) and the
   heavy metals arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and
   zinc (Zn). It is suggested that these sorption measurements may allow an
   estimate of metal and P loadings and subsequently sludge application
   rates which are environmentally acceptable, particularly in terms of
   minimal off-site movement. The extent of sorption of an element in a
   particular soil horizon was characterised by sorption curves which
   showed the relationship between the amount of element sorbed by the soil
   and the concentration of that element remaining in the supernatant
   solution after an equilibrating period. Buffer capacity, defined by the
   slope of the sorption curve, was calculated for each element in each
   soil horizon. Sorption behaviour of heavy metals and phosphorus varied
   greatly within the soil profile. Cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni) and copper
   (Cu) were retained mainly in the surface All horizon. This was indicated
   by their relatively higher buffer capacities in this horizon and may be
   due to their affinity for organic matter which was present in greatest
   concentrations in this part of the soil profile. On the other hand, the
   greatest sorption capacity for arsenic (As) and phosphorus (P) occurred
   deep in the profile in the B2 horizon where there was a predominance of
   clay and iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) hydrous oxides. Metal and
   phosphorus sorption equations were used to estimate sludge-borne
   elemental loadings to soil at an `'allowable'' output elemental
   concentration of soil leachate to the environment. These loadings,
   together with soil bulk density and extractabilities of elements in the
   sludge, were incorporated in a `'first approximation'' model to estimate
   sludge application rates which were environmentally acceptable in terms
   of minimal off-site movement. These rates, along with other factors such
   as health risk and contamination aspects, should be taken into account
   when calculating ecologically sustainable sludge application rates at a
   particular disposal site.}},

Abstract = {{Pulsed Clarke-type electrodes, a relatively new type of dissolved oxygen
   (DO) sensor, were intended to minimize problems associated with
   sensitivity to flow and biofouling-problems which affect most oxygen
   sensors. The commercially available devices (ENDECO/YSI, Inc., Model
   1184C), which include temperature and conductivity sensors and a data
   logger, are designed for coastal environmental monitoring at depths to
   30 m. In order to evaluate their performance under field conditions, a
   series of field deployments and laboratory calibrations was conducted,
   and the instrument output was compared with precision Winkler
   titrations. Accuracy of reported DO concentrations varied both between
   instruments and with time. Errors typically ranged from 0 to 3 mg/l.
   Thus frequent calibration seems to be a requirement for the accurate use
   of these units. The recommended I-point calibration update did not
   improve accuracy. In the laboratory, the response to varying DO
   concentrations at constant temperature was highly linear over a range of
   approx. 5-14 mg/l; both accuracy and response time decreased at low DO
   concentrations, somewhere between 0 and 1.5 mg/l. Potential sources of
   inaccuracy in DO measurements include (1) statistical error associated
   with the estimation of calibration constants, and (2) operation of the
   instrument near the extremes of the temperature range used to calibrate
   it. We found support for the claim that the instruments are relatively
   insensitive to fouling.}},

Abstract = {{The extraction, fractionation and characterization of sediment

   column chromatography. Each fraction was characterized by GC-MS,
   GC/MS/i.r. and i.r. spectrophotometry. The first fraction (FA) contained
   aliphatic hydrocarbons, the second fraction (FB) contained 2-5-ring
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the third fraction (FC)
   contained substituted phenols and 4- and 5-ring PAHs. The toxicity of
   each fraction to Photobacterium phosphoreum and Gammarus pulex was
   assessed. The FA fraction was the most toxic to P. phosphoreum and the
   FC fraction was the least toxic. In contrast the FB fraction was the
   most toxic to G. pulex and the other two fractions were not toxic at the

Abstract = {{Movement in groundwater of nitrogen, leaching from a domestic septic

   Losses of nitrogen in soil were determined by adding bromide to the

   bromide in groundwater, downgradient of the leach drain of the septic
   tank. At least 80\% of inorganic nitrogen leaching into the soil appears
   to be lost within a distance of 10 m from the leach drain. Published
   work on changes in N-15/N-14 isotope ratios of nitrate in sandy
   aquifers, affected by domestic septic tank systems, seems to indicate
   that losses of nitrogen are less at higher latitudes.}},

Abstract = {{The outcome of a 7-day pilot monitoring study on the anionic surfactant,
   LAS, at the Yorkshire Water Service's Owlwood activated sludge sewage
   treatment works (STW) is described. The average concentration of LAS
   found in daily flow related composites of raw sewage was 15.1 mg l(-1)
   (range 11.8-18.2 mg l(-1)). The calculated per capita use of the
   surfactant at Owlwood of 4.5 g/d/person agrees closely with the
   predicted use of LAS in Western Europe (ca 4.0 g/dip). Distinct diurnal
   variations in the raw sewage LAS concentrations were observed (3.7-31.8
   mg l(-1)) and were apparent to a lesser degree in the treated effluent.
   The removal of the organic load (measured as BOD) and LAS at the works
   were both very high, 98 and 99.9\% respectively. Hence, very low
   concentrations of LAS were discharged to the associated Sheffield Beck
   in the treated effluent (average daily composite of 10.4 mu g l(-1)).
   Unexpectedly, the river upstream of the discharge was found to
   contribute a higher load of LAS to the river downstream than the Owlwood
   effluent. The average daily composite LAS concentration in the river
   below the mixing zone of the STW was 27 mu g l(-1) (range 9.4-47 mu g
   l(-1)). The concentrations of LAS found on sediments in the immediate
   vicinity of the STW were very small (< 1 mu g g(-1)). The implications
   of the study findings for the Standing Committer of Analysts (SCA)
   methodology used for the analysis of LAS and the design of further
   monitoring exercises on surfactants are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The survival rates of enteric bacteria (i.e. Escherichia coli and
   enterococci) exposed to a sunlight simulator were determined at two
   different depths of sea water in varying conditions of light intensity,
   turbidity, sewage content, degree of mixing and temperature under
   controlled laboratory conditions. The combined effect of these factors
   on bacterial die-off was evaluated by statistical analyses carried out
   on the experimental data obtained according to the central composite
   experimental design. The magnitude and the general character of the
   influence of the factors were determined. The variability of bacterial
   mortality due to the effect of light was shown to depend on the
   variability of the intensity of light and the other microenvironmental
   factors (i.e. turbidity, sewage content, and mixing) influencing the
   depth profile of the light intensity and bacterial concentration. All
   factors except temperature were found to exert a significant influence
   on bacterial die-off under light conditions. Higher rates of die-off
   were brought about by high levels of light intensity and mixing with low
   levels of turbidity and sewage content of the water. No appreciable
   difference was found between the survival capabilities of E. call and
   enterococci on exposure to light.}},

   obtained. Results showed that of these, most could be identified as A.
   johnsonii (genospecies 7) although other genospecies including 9 and 12
   were also found in smaller numbers. A large number of these could not be
   identified with the Biolog system. Several other Gram positive and Gram
   negative bacterial genera capable of removing polyphosphate were also
   isolated from the biomass. The filamentous bacterial populations seen in
   the mixed liquor and foam were monitored regularly over this period, and
   after early changes, Microthrix parvicella and Eikelboom Types 0092 and
   0041/0675 gradually assumed dominance in the mixed liquor,while Nocardia

Abstract = {{Sediment cores and samples of the submerged and rooted isoetid
   Eriocaulon septangulare (With.) were used to examine the relationships
   between the concentrations of Hg, Pb, Cd and Fe in plants, and metal
   concentrations and organic matter (OM) content of sediments. Thirteen
   sites in the littoral zone of Bentshoe Lake, a softwater lake of the
   Muskoka-Haliburton region of south-central Ontario were included in the
   study design. Metal concentrations in sediments ranged from 0.007 to
   0.247 mu g g(-1) for Hg, 2.8 to 167.6 mu g g(-1) for Pb, 0.06 to 2.53 mu
   g g(-1) for Cd and 2.55 to 34.77 mg g(-1) for Fe. There were significant
   positive correlations between metal concentrations in sediment and OM
   content. Metal concentrations measured in Eriocaulon septangulare were
   generally comparable to or higher than those in sediments, and for each
   respective metal, were consistently higher in the roots than in the
   shoots. Concentrations of metals in E. septangulare ranged (dry weight,
   leaf concentration listed first and roots second for each metal) from
   0.03 to 0.22 mu g g(-1) for Hg, from 2.6 to 62.8 mu g g(-1) for Pb, from
   0.58 to 13.33 mu g g(-1) for Cd and from 0.61 to 156.20 mg g(-1) for Fe.
   Metal concentrations in the roots and in the leaves were significantly
   positively correlated for Hg, Cd and Fe. Metal concentrations in the
   roots were not correlated with metal concentrations in the sediments.
   The presence of high concentrations of organic matter (OM) in sediments
   is shown to decrease the availability of metals to E. septangulare.
   However, when the total metal concentrations in sediments were
   normalized for organic content, there was a significant correlation with
   metal in the plant for Hg, but not for the other metals under
   consideration.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a miniature egg hatching system to evaluate chemical
   treatments on fish eggs. The system was designed to provide
   scientifically reproducable data according to good laboratory practices
   as opposed to other hatchery systems that are designed solely for fish
   production. A detailed explanation of the construction of this test
   apparatus is provided with insight into potential applications of the
   system in toxicology or water research. The test apparatus was composed
   of a headbox, miniaturized egg hatching jars, and glass aquaria. The
   test system was supplied with a continuous flow of well water that
   entered a headbox and then flowed by gravity to the egg hatching jars. A
   three-way stopcock valve located between the headbox and egg jars
   directed water from the headbox to the eggs or administered premixed
   chemical solutions during treatments. The effluent from the egg jars
   flowed into glass aquaria that collected hatched fry. The aquaria
   effluent flowed through a carbon filter treatment system. The
   miniaturized system is portable and can be used to culture or to conduct
   toxicological studies on early life stages of fish. Our test system was
   as efficient as larger-scale systems in culturing eggs and fry and will
   reduce the cost of evaluating therapeutants or toxicants in acute or
   chronic exposures.}},

Abstract = {{The toxicity of copper to Staurastrum chaetoceras (Schr.) G. M. Smith
   and Staurastrum manfeldtii Delp. has been evaluated using lake water and
   synthetic media. It appeared that the EC50 values of growth inhibition
   in synthetic medium with chelators were overestimated, compared to
   natural water. The omission of chelators in the synthetic medium led to
   EC50 values distinctly lower than in lake water cultures. The species
   Staurastrum manfeldtii isolated from an oligomesotrophic environment
   proved to be significantly more sensitive to copper than Staurastrum
   chaetoceras originating from a eutrophic environment; this difference
   was observed in all media tested. It is concluded that the use of
   synthetic media is likely to give distorted information on metal
   toxicity so that the use of lake water is to be recommended for
   ecologically relevant tests.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{In the domain of photochemical processes for water treatment much of the
   technology has been developed using u.v.-radiation in order to degrade
   the microbiological and chemical contaminants in drinking water (Legrini
   et al., 1993). With regard to the removal of microbiological pollutants,
   the u.v.-disinfection of water is discussed as a promising alternative
   to the use of chemical disinfectants (Von Sonntag and Schuchmann, 1992).
   In addition, a number of papers have reported on advanced techniques for
   the oxidation of organic pollutants by the combination of u.v.-light and
   oxidants such as O-3 and/or H2O2 (Von Sonntag et al., 1993; Paillard et
   al., 1992; Hessler et al., 1993). These advanced oxidation processes
   (AOP) are particularly oriented towards commercial application and have
   stimulated interest in the design of efficient reactors and construction
   of new light sources. Thus, the formulation of the photokinetic rates of
   a photochemical process is one of the most difficult parts of reactor
   design and involves determination of the absorbed light intensity
   causing chemical conversion, e.g. the generation of highly reactive
   hydroxyl radicals. Actinometric measurements may often cause problems
   due to the polychromatic emission of medium-pressure Hg-arcs, which are
   used in oxidative degradation procedures.
   Referring to polychromatic actinometry, this paper deals with the
   practical use of filter solutions as an appropriate method for
   approaching monochromatic conditions with polychromatic radiation. The
   experiments were carried out with the annular photoreactor of a pilot
   plant for drinking water treatment (Fig. 1). For evaluation of the
   u.v.-irradiance of the medium-pressure Hg-arc (Fig. 2) in the 240-470 nm
   range, the azobenzene photoisomerization was used as a chemical
   actinometer (Gauglitz and Hubig, 1985; Gauglitz and Hubig, 1981; Kuhn et
   al., 1989) and filter solutions were taken to isolate certain parts of
   the radiation spectrum. The general problem of preparing solution
   filters is essentially an empirical one of combining inorganic salts and
   organic, mainly aromatic, compounds in appropriate solvents like water.
   The selection requirements for choosing a proper solution filter are as
   follows:
   specific transmittance to obtain wavelength bands or strong emission
   lines, which are within the range of the absorption of pollutants;
   removal of unwanted spectral bands for wavelength selective actinometry;
   photochemical stability and no dark reactions.
   With respect to the determination of light fluxes over the entire
   irradiated volume, which could be carried out inside the irradiation
   unit as internal actinometry, experiments with liquid filters are not
   practicable because filter and actinometric solutions must be separated
   (Table 2). Thus, only external actinometry was possible and cuvettes
   containing a filter and the actinometer solution were placed outside the
   vessel (Fig. 3). As a consequence, the reactor geometry must be taken
   into account by theoretical equations concerning the radiation field
   (Alfano et al., 1986). The band pass filters, which were used for
   actinometric measurements, are composed of various filter components
   (Table 1) and gave a light distribution enriched with narrow bands of
   radiation {[}Fig. 4(a) and (b)]. The spectral overlapping of distinct
   absorption bands of the azobenzene actinometer (Fig. 5) with
   non-attenuated wavelengths of the are-spectrum {[}Fig. 6(a)(c)] is
   required for obtaining selectivity in actinometric measurements.
   However, the calculation of intensities by photokinetic rate equations
   is limited to monochromatic light and influences of slightly
   polychromatic irradiation on fundamental parameters, such as quantum
   yields, still exist. These difficulties could be overcome if the
   photokinetic quantities, particularly the molar absorptivities of trans-
   and cis-azobenzene and thus the pseudo quantum yield, were by weighted
   averages. Irradiation intensities in the range of 290-360, 335-400 and
   375-470 nm could be measured with the filters I-III by assuming that the
   absorption of the actinometer solutions is negligible. Measurement of
   the light intensity in the u.v.-C region could be achieved by using the
   filter solutions IV and V with different transmission characteristics
   (Fig. 7). In the case when total absorption of the actinometer is
   assumed, a linear relationship between Delta E and the irradiation time
   is obtained for each filter respectively. The intensity of the
   irradiation source can finally be calculated by the difference of the
   slopes. In general, radiation powers of light sources measured by
   external actinometry must be related to the total intensity at the
   outside wall of the inner quartz tube of the u.v.-arc Experimental
   quantities, which decrease the u.v.-radiation in the actinometric
   solution like the transmittance of the filter solutions and the cooling
   water must therefore be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Soluble unreactive phosphorus (SUP) in concentrated forest stream
   (Walker Branch, Tenn.) and lake water (Crystal Lake, I11.) samples was
   analyzed with an anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC) system containing a phosphorus-specific detector. The detector,
   which utilized the ascorbic acid-molybdate reaction, consisted of a
   flow-injection system, a post-column reactor, and a u.v.-vis detector.
   Before HPLC analysis, samples were concentrated and molecular size
   fractionated with a series of ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis
   membranes. The SUP composition was found to be a function of season in
   both Crystal Lake and Walker Branch, as well as a function of stream
   length for Walker Branch. Seasonal and spatial SUP variations could be
   explained using contemporary knowledge of nutrient cycling in streams
   and lakes. A signal, seen in many of the HPLC traces and which eluted
   with the solvent front, was characterized but not fully identified using
   several extraction and degradation methods, as a function of sample
   concentration.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of high performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE),
   especially in the free solution mode (FSCE), is demonstrated for the
   analysis/characterization of environmental humic substances (HUS). The
   very high efficiency of HPCE separations allows the production of
   electropherograms that are more characteristic for HUS than are liquid
   chromatograms; in addition, HUS can be analyzed by FSCE in their
   naturally occurring anionic forms. Fulvic and humic acid fractions of
   HUS extracted from soil and water by procedures of the International
   Humic Substances Society were analyzed using an uncoated silica column
   and acetate, berate or phosphate buffer systems to produce
   electropherograms of the anionic species. Soil fulvic acids exhibit a
   consistent and characteristic set of sharp peaks, extending from a humic
   `'hump''; migration times range between 5 and 12 min depending on soil
   source, buffer and pH. Humic acids give only the `'hump,'' which
   sometimes has shoulders but little definition. Soil and river humic
   acids produce only slightly different electropherograms at pH 8.30 in a
   berate buffer system, and each shows a remarkable peak-sharpening as the
   pH is increased to just 8.55. The electropherograms of `'young'' and
   `'old'' groundwater fulvic acids show different fingerprints.}},

Abstract = {{Gains and losses in the phosphorus load in a small groundwater-fed
   river, the River Nar in East Anglia, have been estimated over four
   drought years. Annual phosphorus balances between downstream sites imply
   that dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) was retained increasingly over
   the drought. The external DIP loading to the River did not change over
   the 4 years although phosphorus retention increased from 30\% of the
   gain in 1989 to 70\% during 1992. Over the different years, between
   about 5\% and 15\% (which was about 100-400 kg year(-1)) of the DIP in
   the River was washed out to its estuary. Biological uptake by higher
   plants probably accounted for most of the DIP which was retained. Data
   used for this work have been taken from existing monitoring programmes.
   The resolution of the desk study has none the less been sufficient to
   show that increases in phosphorus retention have been large enough for
   undesirable effects on the biological community of the River.}},

   pH < 1, the retention of Cr(VI) was found to be affected by its
   reduction to Cr(lll), the lower the pH the greater the facility to be
   reduced to Cr(III). The extent of adsorption and reduction processes
   depends on the porous texture, nature and preparation procedure of the
   activated carbons, the best performance being obtained with those
   prepared by physical activation.}},

Abstract = {{The oxidation of water to oxygen by bromate ions is mediated by the
   heterogeneous redox catalyst ruthenium-Adams, a high surface area and
   very stable form of ruthenium(IV) oxide. The initial kinetics of
   catalysis are investigated as a function of {[}BrO3-], {[}Ru-Adams],
   temperature and {[}anion], where `'anion'' = ClO4- Cl- or Br-. An
   electrochemical model of heterogeneous redox catalysis, in which the two
   participating redox couples are both electrochemically irreversible, is
   used to interpret most of the kinetic data. The observed inhibition of
   the initial rate of the redox reaction by Cl- and, especially, Br- ions
   is tentatively attributed to competitive adsorption. In the presence of
   organic species, such as methanol, ethanol and propan-1-ol, which are
   more easily oxidised than water by bromate ions, the rate of BrO3- ion
   reduction is significantly faster, i.e. ca 24-34 times.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2195-2205}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Iron oxyhydroxides, commonly known as ferrihydrites, are unable to
   remove dissolved heavy metals at acidic pH, especially below 5.0, due to
   fierce competition from hydrogen ions. A new hybrid iron-rich inorganic
   sorbent has been identified and extensively studied in relation to heavy
   metals removals in fixed-bed processes for influent pH as low as 3.5.
   Every single particle of this new hybrid sorbent essentially contains
   ferrihydrite along with a crystalline silicate phase, akermanite, in
   close proximity (in the order of 100 Angstrom) to one another.
   Akermanite has a unique ability to produce hydroxyl ions through
   incongruent hydrolysis reactions without being washed out from the fixed
   bed. The simultaneous presence of akermanite and ferrihydrite in a
   single particle has a synergistic effect on the sorption process: while
   akermanite helps neutralize aqueous-phase hydrogen ions (thus enhancing
   sorption capacity of ferrihydrites), neighboring sorption sites in
   ferrihydrites quickly remove dissolved heavy metals, thus avoiding
   precipitation. Equally important, the hybrid sorbent can be regenerated
   with any amine/ammoniacal solution and reused for multiple number of
   cycles. Some precipitations may occur within the column at relatively
   high influent concentrations of heavy metals (around 50 mg/l) or due to
   chromatographic effect. Such precipitates are, however, amenable to
   removals by conventional backwashing.}},

Abstract = {{A membrane reactor for the elimination of oxygen in an anoxic medium for
   microbial growth has been studied. The reactor consists of a reservoir
   containing a solution of sulfite and cobalt salt where silicone tubing,
   through which the medium hows, is immersed. Silicone is highly permeable
   to gases, so oxygen diffuses through the silicone membrane and is
   absorbed in the sulfite solution. The maximum oxygen removal rate was
   1.1 g m(-2)d(-1) at 15 degrees C. The advantage of this de-oxygenator is
   its low cost and the ease with which it can be handled. A calculation
   method is discussed in relation to the design of the membrane
   de-oxygenator.}},

Abstract = {{A model of shear aggregation is proposed using the ideas of fractal
   geometry of aggregates. It is shown that the aggregate structure depends
   on the constituent clusters parameters-their sizes and fractal
   dimensions. Generally the fractal dimension of formed aggregate
   increases with the ratio of sizes of constituent clusters. As a result
   of the collision sequence the aggregate size distribution is formed, as
   well as the effective fractal dimension of the population. The width of
   the aggregate size interval is related to the fractal dimension of the
   cluster population. The time decrease of aggregation rate is interpreted
   as caused by progressive exclusion of part of the cluster population
   from the mutual aggregation. At the end of aggregation all aggregates
   that would be produced are too weak to sustain the hydrodynamic stresses
   caused by shear. The model is successfully verified experimentally with
   no insert of adjustable parameters, so the mechanism of shear
   aggregation may be regarded as better understood.}},

Abstract = {{A laboratory-scale leaching study with 50/50 Sn/Pb-soldered copper
   coupons showed the potential for water contamination. Significant
   leaching of Pb and Sn occurred from the Sn/Pb solder into high-purity,
   tap, treated and well water samples. The amounts of Cu and Zn released
   from soldered copper coupons were generally lower than those released
   from non-soldered copper coupons. No significant leaching of Cd occurred
   from the solder into the water samples. Optical micrographs of the
   exposed coupons showed evidence of corrosion, especially in the case of
   treated and well water samples. Further examination using electron
   microprobe and X-ray electron spectroscopic techniques showed the
   presence of lead and tin oxides on the Sn/Pb solder surface confirming
   the occurrence of galvanic corrosion. Transmission electron microscopy
   equipped with energy dispersive X-ray analysis unit showed the presence
   of Pb, S and Sn on the surface of samples exposed to well water.
   Therefore, it can be surmised that the surface is covered with Pb and Sn
   oxides, possibly accompanied by small amounts of sulphur species of
   lead.}},

   (300-400 nm) comparable in intensity to midday summer sunlight,
   metolachlor reacted in 8 min and was completely mineralized to HCl (40
   min), inorganic N (7:1 ratio of NH3 and HNO3, > 2 h), and CO2 (6 h). The
   aromatic ring was mineralized in 2.5 h. The transient organic
   intermediates identified-chloroacetate, oxalate, formate, serine, and
   several derivatives with the aromatic ring intact-indicate non-selective
   attack on the molecule. Under the same conditions, methyl parathion
   reacted in 5 min giving quantitative yields of HNO3 and H3SO4 (5 min)
   and H3PO4 (30 min). Oxalic acid, 4-nitrophenol, dimethyl phosphoric
   acid, and traces of O,O-dimethyl-4-nitrophenyl phosphoric acid were
   identified as intermediates and shown to be oxidized further. Solutions
   of C-14-4-nitrophenol evolved HNO3 concomitant with disappearance of
   starting material, and evolved (CO2)-C-14 within 45 min. Based on the
   intermediates and their yields the initial oxidant attack on methyl
   parathion appears to be on the P=S group leading to elimination of
   4-nitrophenol and dimethyl phosphate. The results suggest that
   photoassisted Fenton oxidation can be a mild and effective remedy for

Abstract = {{Chemicals used to control phytoplankton blooms induce the release of
   phytotoxins that increase the potential health risks in drinking water
   supplies. To test this hypothesis, the effects of six chemical
   treatments on the release of the cyanobacterial toxin, microcystin-LR
   (MCLR; 182-837 mu g g(-1) dry wt) from freshly collected phytoplankton
   were examined in laboratory experiments. In addition, the integrity of a
   chemically-treated culture of Microcystis aeruginosa was examined by
   both a scanning electron microscope and a transmission electron
   microscope. Chemicals which control cyanobacterial blooms through
   inhibition of cell functions (e.g. Reglone A, potassium permanganate,
   chlorine, and Simazine) appeared to induce cell lysis and subsequently
   increased dissolved MCLR concentration in the surrounding water. In
   contrast, both lime and alum treatment (within pH 6-10) controlled the
   cyanobacterial blooms mainly by cell-coagulation and sedimentation,
   without any (lime) or only little (alum) increase in dissolved MCLR
   concentration in the water. The estimated half-life of released MCLR
   from these dense cyanobacterial blooms ranged from 0.5 (+/- 0.1) to 1.6
   (+/- 0.0) d. In contrast, x greater than or equal to 39\% of the MCLR
   remained in decaying phytoplankton for up to 26 d, therefore it is
   likely that MCLR would persist and decay inside the lime or alum
   coagulated Microcystis cells, before being released into the surrounding
   water phase. For these reasons, lime or to a lesser extent alum, appears
   to be more suitable than either algicides or chlorine for the control of
   microcystin-containing cyanobacterial blooms in drinking water.}},

Abstract = {{An in situ nitrifier mass estimation technique was developed to estimate
   the nitrifier population within an activated sludge sample using
   dominant cultures of nitrifying organisms. This technique was applied to
   activated sludge samples from the Milton, Ontaric Wastewater Treatment
   Plant and the results were compared to nitrifier population estimates
   calculated using the IAWPRC (now IAWQ) Activated Sludge Model No. 1
   (ASM1). Several sets of nitrification model parameters were used,
   including values calculated in this investigation from dominant cultures
   of nitrifier organisms as well as the ASM1 default estimates. The trends
   in active nitrifier population measured by the in situ mass estimation
   technique (MET) were predicted by the model simulations when the
   parmaeter estimates developed in this study were used. There was good
   agreement and no statistical difference existed between the model
   estimates and the experimentally determined masses. The current ASM1
   default parameters did not predict the trends in the active population
   as measured by MET.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has resulted in conflicting conclusions concerning
   possible statistical relationships between bacterial indicator and
   enterovirus concentrations in marine waters. Results have suggested
   either highly significant relationships or no significant correlation.
   To examine these relationships further, large compliance assessment data
   sets for identified bathing waters on the English and Welsh coast,
   between 1988 and 1992, were extended to include enterovirus and faecal
   streptococci counts in addition to total and faecal coliform data. The
   suitability of these data for parametric correlation analysis was
   assessed by examining the nature of the statistical distributions of raw
   data and residual values from regression analyses. The data were
   acceptable for parametric analysis when (i) zero enterovirus samples
   were excluded and (ii) enterovirus counts were logarithmically
   transformed. The analysis of over 690 data pairs produced positive
   Pearson correlation coefficients between coliforms, faecal coliforms,
   faecal streptococci and enterovirus concentrations. Though the
   correlations were significant (P < 0.001, i.e. > 99.9\% confidence) they
   were low (r < 0.5). The amount of variance in enterovirus concentration
   explained by bacterial concentration was only 15-16\%. Relationships
   were similar for each bacterial determinand. Correlations above
   successive quartile values of bacterial concentration revealed no
   threshold effect in these relationships. These results suggest poor
   statistical relationships between concentrations of bacterial indicators
   of sewage pollution and enterovirus in marine waters resulting in a low
   predictive capability.}},

   microorganisms were detected on the coupon surfaces by scanning electron
   microscopy. The growth of microorganisms was patchy and in the form of
   small colonies attached to the surfaces with a confluent film of
   extracellular polysaccharide or fine strands. Corrosion products, such
   as sulphur, could not be detected. The potential for biofouling and
   microbially-influenced corrosion exists in the deionized water system

Abstract = {{Using marine bivalve mussels Mytidus edulis and Aequipecten irradians as
   the biological indicators, the chronic (60 days) bioaccumulation tests
   were conducted to evaluate the effect of tributyltin (TBT) on bivalve
   mussels. TBT and its degraded products-Dibutyltin and Monobutyltin-were
   determined in mussels and seawater. Bioconcentration Factor (BCF)
   increased exponentially with decreasing concentration of TBT, BCFs were
   much higher than predicted values by Kow. Some physiological effects of
   TBT on the shell length, width, whole body weight and Condition Index
   were measured and used as indicating indices on the contamination of TBT
   to bivalve mussels. Some pathological effects at cellular level were
   observed under the electron-microscope, the mitochondria of test M.
   edulis's liver swelled and disrupted, so the mechanism of toxicity was
   suggested. Based on the results of the bioaccumulation test the risk
   evaluation for humans was made. The results of bioaccumulation of TBT by
   algae revealed that accumulation through the food chain was very
   important.}},

Abstract = {{The amenability of iron(III) phosphate complexes towards reduction by
   hydroxylammonium chloride at different pH was tested in laboratory
   experiments. Higher pH and higher phosphate contents of the precipitates
   reduced both the extent and the rate of iron reduction. The dissolution
   of Fe(lII) phosphate complexes was generally incongruous. This can be
   due to redistribution of phosphate or preferential reduction. The course
   of iron reduction and phosphate adsorption were simulated with a model
   relating the reduction rate to the level of phosphate sorption to the
   surface as described by a Langmuir isotherm. Hampering of the reduction
   was more than proportional to the fraction of sorption sites occupied by
   phosphate. The ecological significance of the results is that in
   phosphate-rich freshwater sediments, the seasonal variation in depth of
   the oxic layer may result ih incomplete reduction of the iron complexes
   ultimately buried by sediment accumulation. This would enhance the
   sediment fixation capacity and reduce the internal loading of phosphate.}},

Abstract = {{The experimental investigation of mechanism and favourable operating
   conditions of organic substrate removal in Microaerophilic Upflow Sludge
   Bed Reactor (MUSB) was carried out. COD was degraded due to attached
   aerobic biomass in Aeration Vessels (AV). And in nonaerated Biological
   Vessels (BV) COD was found to be degraded either due to aerobic
   metabolism utilizing oxygen coming from AV or due to sulfur metabolism
   utilizing sulfate as an electron acceptor. Sulfate reducing bacteria
   outcompeted methane producing bacteria. Yield coefficient was evaluated
   using Phosphorus balance and was found to vary between 0.4 and 0.5. With
   increase in retention time COD removal efficiency was increased. At an
   organic loading of 1.4 kg COD m(-3)d(-1), 80\% of COD removal efficiency
   was achieved in 4,5 h. The maximum loading which can be applied was
   found to be limited due to availability of sulfate ion in the influent.
   At an organic loading of 2.4 kg COD m(-3) d(-1), COD removal efficiency
   was reduced to 60\%. At higher loading i.e. 2.4 kg COD m(-3)d(-1), at a
   retention time of 3.5 h, sulfide was found to be dissolved in the
   effluent and contributed as inorganic COD and reduced the COD removal
   efficiency. Upflow velocity in BV affected considerably the shape and
   characteristics of granules formed. At an upflow velocity of 110-140 m
   d(-1), rigid granules with diameter varying from 4 to 6 mm were formed.}},

Abstract = {{More than 250 coliform and noncoliform bacteria, isolated by standard
   membrane filtration methods from rural, untreated groundwater supplies,
   were examined for resistance to 16 antibiotics. All of the noncoliforms
   and 87\% of the coliforms were resistant to at least one antibiotic,
   with resistance most commonly directed toward novobiocin, cephalothin,
   and ampicillin. The frequency of multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR)
   within each species was also determined. Approximately 60\% of the
   coliforms were MAR, including 14, 64, and 94\% of Escherichia coli,
   Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively.
   In comparison, MAR was demonstrated by more than 95\% of the
   noncoliforms and included isolates of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus,
   Aeromonas hydrophila, and Serratia marcescens. Ampicillin-resistant
   environmental isolates were assayed for ability to transfer resistance
   to ampicillin-sensitive strains of E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium.
   Environmental E. coli isolates were capable of in vitro transfer to both
   recipients in a nutrient-rich environment (trypticase soy broth) at
   frequencies ranging from 1.1 x 10(-5) to 1.0 x 10(-4). Isolates of C.
   freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited resistance transfer to the
   E. coli recipient under similar conditions at reduced rates. None of the
   environmental isolates demonstrated transfer of ampicillin resistance
   when placed in an environment containing filter-sterilized well water.
   The presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and particularly MAR
   bacteria, in rural groundwater supplies used as drinking water sources
   may have important public health implications.}},

Abstract = {{Measurement show that wastewater stabilization ponds although often only
   1-2m deep stratify and destratify intermittently depending primarily on
   weather. Stratification can be observed in vertical profiles of water
   temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and other water quality parameters. In
   three stabilization ponds of a Small Minnesota town, stratification
   develops primarily by differential heating of the pondwater through its
   surface and, in the absence of artificial aeration or mixing devices, by
   insufficient wind mixing. The resulting water temperature stratification
   affects other parameters in a variety of ways through chemical,
   microbial and planktonic kinetics and reduced vertical mixing. To gain a
   better understanding of stabilization pond water quality dynamics,
   temperature profiles were monitored at 20-min intervals, and a dynamic
   lake water quality model was modified and applied to simulate the
   temperature stratification. A 12-h timestep option was incorporated into
   the program in order to capture the diurnal Variation in stratification.
   Measurements and simulations were made for three wastewater
   stabilization ponds at Harris, Minnesota. The level of agreement between
   field measurements and numerical simulations demonstrated that water
   temperatures and stratification dynamics in a shallow and small pond can
   be simulated on a diurnal timescale with a standard error from 1.0 to
   1.5 degrees C between simulation and measurements. The model includes
   wastewater inflow in the form of a vertical jet and water transfer
   between ponds in the form of non-surface inflow and outflow. Three types
   of stratification were identified and their respective durations were
   determined. Stratification occurred on about 55\% of all days from 1
   April to 30 November. Information on pond stratification presented can
   be used to guide held studies and reactor modeling of ponds which can
   lead to further improvements in design and operation.}},

Abstract = {{Biofilms influence the transport and fate of heavy metals in aquatic
   environments both directly by adsorption and complexation reactions and
   indirectly via interactions with oxides of iron and manganese. These
   reactions were investigated by introducing lead into a continuous-flow
   biofilm reactor that was designed to simulate conditions in a flowing
   freshwater aquatic environment. The reactor provided controlled
   conditions, and use of a chemically-defined growth medium allowed
   calculation of lead speciation with a chemical equilibrium program
   (MINEQL). Pseudomonas cepacia was employed as a test cell strain because
   of its ability to grow and form biofilms in the defined medium. This
   bacterium affected lead distribution in the reactor by adsorbing lead
   both to adherent and suspended cells. When the aqueous bulk lead
   concentration was 1.4 +/- 0.1 mu M and biofilm coverage (measured as
   chemical oxygen demand, COD) was 50 mequiv COD/m(2), lead adsorption was
   increased by about a factor of five relative to bare glass. Of the total
   lead in solution, only 1\% was adsorbed to suspended cells (5 x 10(7)
   cells/ml). Lead adsorption to biofilms followed a Langmuir isotherm with
   a maximum adsorption (Gamma(max)) of 56 mu mol Pb/equiv COD and an
   adsorption equilibrium constant (IC) of 0.64 liter/mu mol Pb. Lead
   complexed with dissolved bacterial exopolymer was below detection
   limits. Pretreatment of glass slides with colloidal iron also
   significantly increased lead adsorption relative to bare glass. Lead
   adsorption to adsorbed iron fit a Langmuir isotherm with Gamma(max) = 50
   mu mol Pb/mol Fe, and K = 1.3 liter/mu mol Pb. Lead binding to glass
   coated with both cells and iron was additive, and could be predicted by
   summing adsorption predicted using isotherms for each constituent. The
   presence of iron surface coatings increased initial biofilm formation
   rates, but after reaching steady state conditions, biofilm coverage was
   similar for slides treated with iron and untreated slides. A
   concentration of 1 mu M lead produced a transient reduction in suspended
   cell counts. Cell counts recovered to the original cell density over the
   course of five to ten reactor retention times. With iron present, the
   magnitude of the reduction in cell concentration in response to the
   addition of lead was greatly reduced, suggesting that toxic effects of
   lead may be reduced by iron.}},

   Various concentrations of treated effluent from a trickling filter

   using soya bean (Glicine max (L.) merrill) and maize (Zea mays L.) as
   the test crops. Both crops responded well to effluent irrigation, but
   with important differences between them in terms of grain dry matter and
   nitrogen uptake. This response was influenced by the timing and the
   amount of effluent applied, with decreasing effluent applications early
   in the growing season stimulating nitrogen uptake from the soil.
   Recovery of the applied nitrogen was greater in maize than soya bean
   under full irrigation. In addition an improvement in nitrogen

Abstract = {{The river quality model QUASAR (Quality Simulation Along Rivers) has
   been applied to the River Don system in North East Scotland. This mass
   balance model for nitrogen has been used to estimate the impacts of land
   use change and climate change on river water quality. Changing
   agricultural patterns have been simulated and indicate increased
   nitrogen levels in the river as catchment land use changes. Climate
   change will alter flow regimes, temperature and nitrogen mineralization
   patterns. Simulation runs for a range of scenarios illustrate the
   impacts of climate change with the most significant effect being
   mineralization of nitrogen in the soil feeding through into the river
   system. These higher nitrogen levels are reduced slightly by the
   increased temperatures and decreased summer hows, both of which enhance
   denitrification processes.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes a two-stage biodegradation process linked by a
   bio-transformation process as a mechanism involved in the biodegradation
   of complex industrial wastewaters; and developed a mechanistic oxygen
   uptake model based on the proposed mechanism; The reliability of the new
   mechanistic model was eveluated using various representative organic
   mixtures including glucose/glutamic acid solutions, three types of
   wastewaters, ozone treated secondary effluents, and various fragments
   derived from these effluents. The results revealed that (1) through
   proper calibration, the new mechanistic model can satisfactorily predict
   the oxygen uptake by various complex wastewaters over the long term; (2)
   the new model can be used reliably to assess and effectively to compare
   the biodegradability of complex wastewaters; (3) the new model,
   considering both stoichiometry and kinetics of biochemical reactions, is
   also simple but sensitive, and is a practical measure for evaluating the
   mechanistic-kinetic constants involved in the biodegradation processes.
   The reliability of the new model has also been verified by using the
   data from another independent study. The results from this study also
   suggested that the new model provides a uniform means of assessing the
   alteration of biodegradability induced by various physical and chemical
   treatment processes.}},

   catalyst. The gaseous emissions (HC, NOx, CO) and VOC (formaldehyde and
   14 major aromatic compounds) introduced by the exhaust into the water
   were quantitatively determined. The weighted emissions of HC and the
   introduction of VOC (benzene, toluene, xylenes, etc.) into the water
   were much higher for two-stroke than for four-stroke engines. Using
   ethanol instead of regular unleaded gasoline in a two-stroke engine
   essentially reduced the emission of aromatic compounds. Different
   lubricating oils had no significant effect on the gaseous emissions and
   introduction of VOC into the water. A new catalyst designed for
   two-stroke engines with a bypass and post-combustion essentially
   improved the emission of gases and VOC.}},

Abstract = {{Toxicity and odour threshold concentrations of water polluted by the
   emissions of outboard engines were analysed quantitatively using a test
   stand arrangement. Acute toxicity was determined by Daphnia magna and
   the bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri. The emissions of
   two-stroke engines into the water proved to be much more toxic than
   those of four-stroke engines of equal power. When a catalyst was used,
   toxicity was no longer detectable in the assays we tested. The use of
   different lubricating oils had only marginal effects on toxicity while
   the use of different fuels, unleaded gasoline and 96\% ethanol, showed
   declining toxicity in the order stated. The toxicity of water polluted
   by a four-stroke engine and a catalyst equipped two-stroke engine was
   negligible after a period of 14 days while toxicity of water
   contaminated by a two-stroke engine persisted for more than 14 days. The
   acute toxicity of the test stand water could be explained by the
   presence of aromatic compounds. Mixtures of the major components
   (3-ethyltoluene, 4-ethyltoluene, pseudocumene, indene, benzaldehyde,
   naphthalene) when tested in concentrations in which they were observed
   in the test stand water gave a similar inhibition response in the
   bioassays as polluted test stand water. The effect of two-stroke engines
   on the odour threshold concentrations of water was found to be severe;
   e.g. a 15 kW two-stroke engine that operates for 1 h makes 11,000 m(3)
   of water undrinkable. The odour threshold concentrations of C-3 benzenes
   were determined.}},

Abstract = {{Alunite, K2SO4 . Al-2(SO4)(3) . Al-4(OH)(3) is a mineral not soluble in
   water in its original form. It was formed by hydrothermal alteration of
   tuff. Therefore it contains approximately 50\% SiO2. When heated to 700
   degrees C, it becomes soluble in water and such soluble components as
   Al-2(SO4)(3) and K2SO4 dissolve in water. In the present work, the
   coagulant characteristics of the calcined alunite were examined and
   whether or not calcined alunite could be used a coagulant aid was
   determined. The alunite was crushed and calcined at various temperatures
   ranging from 600 degrees C to 900 degrees C. The effectiveness of
   coagulant aid of the calcined alunite using at various doses, together
   with aluminium sulphate in jar test, was investigated. The jar tests
   were made in the synthetic water sample prepared in varying its
   alkalinity and turbidity.}},

Abstract = {{It was demonstrated by a Coulter counter method in combination with
   photomicrographs that the commercially used anionic surfactant sodium
   dodecylbenzene sulfonate (NaDBS) forms solid crystals with major
   seawater cations as Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and Sr2+ and thus can be removed
   from seawater to sediments. In the presence of calcite particles
   suspended in seawater with variable concentrations of NaDBS, complicated
   mutual interactions occur resulting in partial calcite dissolution, and
   consequently in surface area diminuation. Namely, from Coulter counter
   kinetic measurements simultaneous decrease of the total number and total
   volume of particles was observed. Partial dissolution of calcite was
   also confirmed by the weight loss in the presence of c(t)(NDBS) = 1.6 x
   10(-3) mol l(-1). Remobilization of lead and cadmium ions from calcite
   particles occurs up to c(t)(NaDBS) = 1 x 10(-3) mol l(-1). At
   concentrations above that value, an increased removal of these ions can
   be explained with their adsorption on a reprecipitated calcium salt
   (either with DBS- or with SO42- from SW).}},

Abstract = {{The structural heterogeneity of a microbial biofilm was demonstrated by
   scanning electron microscopy, confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM),
   and cryoembedding followed by sectioning and microscopic examination.
   Biofilm was composed of a binary population of Pseudomonas neruginosa
   and Klebsiella pneumoniae grown in a continuous flow annular reactor.
   The three microscopic methods provided a consistent picture of the
   biofilm as a non-uniform structure characterized by variable thickness
   and variable local cell and polymer densities. Significant changes in
   these parameters occurred in the biofilm over distances of 10 mu m or
   less. Though the biofilm was several hundred microns thick in places,
   areas of bare substratum were also observed on the same sample coupon.
   Cell-free pores and channels in the biofilm interior were evident.
   Specific staining of cellular nucleic acids with ethidium bromide and
   extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) with calcofluor showed that
   cell and EPS distributions did not always overlap. The ethidium
   bromide-stained region was contained within the larger region of
   calcofluor staining; thus, some cell-free areas actually were filled
   with EPS. CSLM and cryoembedding approaches are superior to SEM in their
   ability to image the biofilm interior and in their potential to provide
   quantitative information.}},

   determined for various aged larval fish pulse exposed (PE) for 2h to two
   liver metabolized chemicals: cyanazine which is detoxified, and
   malathion which is activated to a more toxic metabolite. Cyanazine
   toxicity decreased between day 0 and day 3 post-hatch with no further
   change up to day 12 post-hatch. No significant difference in malathion
   toxicity with age was found but a trend of increased toxicity between
   day 0 and day 3 post-hatch was evident. The results indicated that
   rainbowfish liver becomes functional between 0 and 3 days post-hatch.
   Static replacement 96 h LC(50)s (slope, 95\% F.L) for 4-month-old adult
   rainbowfish continuously exposed to cyanazine and malathion were 24.6

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic wave of Frequency 1.1 MHz was used to study the
   sonoluminescence (SL) in air saturated water at temperatures ranging
   from 283 to 313 K. It has been found that the logarithm of the detected
   SL intensity increases linearly with the dissolved oxygen (DO)
   concentration. The waters with five kinds of anions in different
   concentration (10(3) mu g/l): Cl- (5-25), NO3- (0.2-1.8), F- (0.1-2.7),
   HCO3- (8-15), SO42- (0.4-40) were used to simulate natural environmental
   chemistry background. The experimental results show that the anions in
   the simulated waters have no influence on the SL intensity measured.
   Based on the results a new type of DO monitoring method could be
   developed.}},

Abstract = {{A preliminary survey of concentrations of nonylphenol and octylphenol in
   rivers and estuaries in England and Wales was undertaken to establish
   environmental concentrations and to support a biological field
   programme. The analytes were quantified by GC/MS in MID mode after
   concentration onto C18 solid phase extraction columns. A concentration
   of 330 mu g/l total nonylphenol was found in wastewaters from a sewage
   treatment works discharging into the river Aire, and up to 180 mu g/l
   was measured at sites on the same river. Nonylphenol concentrations in
   the river Aire exceed Daphnia chronic effect levels and approach acute
   toxicity levels. Elsewhere, concentrations in rivers and sewage
   effluents were in the range <0.2-12 mu g/l total nonylphenol and are
   below chronic effect levels. Estuarine concentrations were considerably
   lower. The highest concentrations were recorded in the outer Tees
   estuary (5.2 mu g/l nonylphenol, 13 mu g/l octylphenol) and in the
   Mersey estuary (up to 0.32 mu g/l nonylphenol). Over 80\% of the samples
   contained <0.1 mu g/l total nonylphenol, and octylphenol was present

Abstract = {{The influence of pH and humic acids on bioaccumulation and
   bioavailability of tributyltin chloride (TBT) was studied in Daphnia and
   yolk sac larvae of fish Thymallus thymallus. In both organisms,
   bioaccumulation followed a first-order uptake process, and metabolism of
   TBT was slow. Bioconcentration factors in Daphnia and Thymallus were 198
   and 2015, respectively. Uptake rates and bioaccumulation of TBT in
   Daphnia were significantly higher at pH 8.0, where TBT predominates as
   neutral TBTOH species than at pH 6.0, where it predominates as cation.
   Humic acids led to a decrease in TBT bioaccumulation at greater than or
   equal to 1.8 mg . l(-1) dissolved organic carbon (DOG) in Daphnia and
   greater than or equal to 4.0 mg . l(-1) DOC in Thymallus larvae.
   Bioaccumulation of TBT decreased with increasing concentrations of humic
   acids. Hence, chemical speciation of TBT is a determinant factor for the
   bioavailability, and thus bioconcentration and toxicity of this
   organotin compound.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes the complexity of the activated sludge flee
   structure using four methods: (i) microscopic observation of flocs in
   situ and after specific staining, (ii) optimization of flee dispersion

   released from sonicated sludges, and (iv) flee size distributions after
   different sonication times. The sonication of activated sludge at 37 W
   for 60s was found to be best for dispersing flocs and minimizing
   bacterial cell lysis. The polymers released from Aocs were mainly
   proteins, with polysaccharides and DNA. Electron microscopy showed that
   a polysaccharide gel connected the cells together. Raw activated sludges
   give a continuous distribution of particle sizes (1.2-600 mu m). The
   flee size distribution in sonicated sludge samples was used to build a
   model of floc structure showing that the predominating macroflocs (125
   mu m) are formed from 13 mu m microfloc aggregates, which are made up of
   smaller particles (2.5 mu m).}},

Abstract = {{An anaerobic fluidized bed reactor, with 301 sepiolite particles as
   support material was used to study the influence of biofilm growth and
   biogas production over hydrodynamic behaviour. It was verified that
   although gas production transforms the AFBR from a two-phase fluidized
   bed to a three-phase gas-liquid-solid system, the formation of a gas
   phase has little effect over hydrodynamic behaviour, and therefore it is
   possible to describe the bed as like a two-phase solid-liquid system.
   However biofilm development has a more important effect on the
   hydrodynamic behaviour, so it is necessary to reduce the recirculation
   ratio to maintain a set expansion, when the attached volatile solids
   increase. The superficial velocity necessary to maintain a 20\% bed
   expansion, decreased from 11.5 m/h for clean particles, to 9.0 m/h for
   20 g/l attached volatile solids concentration. The growth of the biofilm
   varies throughout the reactor, increasing the natural variation in the
   size of the particles in the bed.}},

Abstract = {{Biofilm formation on glass and Teflon cylinders, situated on top of each
   other in vertical glass columns exposed to different types of treated
   water at a Row rate of 0.2 m/s, was determined using ATP analysis and
   heterotrophic plate counts. Biofilm formation rates (BFR) of these water
   types, as calculated from the linear relationship between exposure time
   and biomass accumulated on the cylinder (glass) surface, were 11.1+/-0.7
   pg ATP/cm(2) . d (r=0.96) for treated ground water (TGW), 38.2+/-4.7 pg
   ATP/cm(2) . d (r=0.90) for treated river water (TRW) and 382+/-30 pg
   ATP/cm(2) . d (r=0.94) for TGW supplemented with 100 mu g of
   acetate-C/l, respectively. Maximum levels of accumulated biomass were
   1300 pg ATP/cm(2) after 114 d of exposure for TGW, 3200 pg ATP/cm(2)
   after 78 d of exposure for TRW and 26,000 pg ATP/cm(2) after 65 d of
   exposure for TGW with acetate, respectively. Material and position of
   the cylinder in the columns either had no significant or a small effect
   on biofilm formation, depending on the water type. The effect of acetate
   addition on the BFR of TGW clearly demonstrated that biofilm formation
   was energy-source limited in this water type. These observations show
   that the experimental setup is suited for assessing BFRs of treated
   water.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradation of a mixture of chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons (CAH)
   by a natural biocoenose of microorganisms was demonstrated in four
   semi-scald plants which served as models for a contaminated industrial
   site (concept of slow sand filters). The plants consisted of columns
   filled with contaminated soil taken from the ground of the spilled site
   and water storage containers that contained the contaminated water. The
   gas saturated water was continously recycled through the fixed bed
   columns. The gases supplied were either pure oxygen, air or nitrogen,
   with the nitrogen-supplied plant serving as a control simulating the
   microaerobic conditions in the natural habitat. A fourth plant was
   filled with sand instead of contaminated soil and supplied with air. It
   served only as a fixed bed and not as a reservoir for organic substrate.
   After 110 days, in all aerated plants more than 99\% of the
   chlorobenzenes (CB), 96\% of the chlorophenols (CP) and 94\% of the
   adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) were removed. In comparison, only 82,
   78 and 49\% of these compounds were removed in the nitrogen-supplied
   plant. Chloride ion concentrations in the aerated plants, measured as
   mineralization product of the AOX-concentrations. increased from 130
   mg/l to 240 and 250 mg/l and coincided with the decrease of
   AOX-concentrations. Total cell counts of water and soil were
   approximately ten times higher in the aerated plants compared to the
   anaerobic or sandfilled plants. Microbial activity measured as
   respiration in the fixed beds showed the same profile.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1995}},

Abstract = {{The influence of ionic strength and PH on the transport of Pseudomonas
   fluorescens P17 in porous media was investigated using continuous-flow
   laboratory columns and a rapid screening technique in which radiolabeled
   cells were applied to large-pore, glass-fiber filters.
   Colloid-filtration theory was used to interpret P17 transport results in
   the two systems. Bacterial retention was directly related to the ionic
   strength of the carrying solution. Decreasing the ionic strength from
   10(-1) to 10(-5) M caused the bacterial collision efficiency, alpha, to
   decrease nearly 90\% (from 0.18 to 0.026 in screening experiments and
   from 0.12 to 0.015 in column experiments). This change in a is
   qualitatively consistent with double layer theory, but suggests that
   very large changes in ionic strength are needed to influence transport.
   Bacterial transport was unaffected by changes in PH in the range of 5.5
   < PH < 7.0 in both systems. This suggests that changes in surface
   properties of the bacteria and the silica collectors over the PH range
   that is commonly encountered in soil and ground water are not sufficient
   to influence cell attachment. The screening technique provided a rapid
   alternative to column experiments. Even though estimated a's were
   different in the two systems, the responses to changes in ionic strength
   and PH were similar.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial strains (SL1: Rhonococcus rhodochrous; WT1: Acinetobacter
   junii) capable of biodegrading atrazine and simazine in surface water
   were inoculated into pilot-scale fixed beds of granular activated carbon
   (GAG, Im depth, 15 min empty bed contact time, EBCT). River water was
   screened, clarified, ozonated and spiked with atrazine and simazine
   (post-ozonation concentration 0.5-15 mu g l(-1) of each s-triazine)
   before entering GAC columns that were monitored for 302 d. Elution of
   inoculated isolates from GAC columns peaked 15 min (WT1) and 30 (SL1)
   min after inoculation, but had fallen to 3.8 +/- 0.13 x 10(3) ml(-1)
   (WT1) and 3.6 +/- 3.37 x 10(2) ml(-1) (SL1) by 120 min. During routine
   operation, elution of SL1 was frequently <10 ml(-1) and less than WTI,
   and from day 0 to day 119 SL1 was retained on GAC in greater numbers
   (minimum 8.8 +/- 0.32 x 10(4) g(-1) dry wt GAG) than indigenous WTI (1.1
   +/- 0.16 x 10(4) g(-1) dry wt GAG) or introduced WTI (9.1 +/- 0.00 x

   (SL1 or WTI) had less adsorbed s-triazine per column than non-inoculated
   GAG. Inoculation of GAC with s-triazine-degrading isolate SL1 reduced
   transient breakthrough concentrations of atrazine and simazine compared
   to non-inoculated and WT1-inoculated column effluents on days 21, 84,
   140 and 170. However, from day 189 onwards consistent breakthrough
   occurred in all effluents exceeding the EU maximum admissible

Abstract = {{Novel methods for removal of bacteria, viruses and high BOD material,
   such as proteins, from industry wastes and sewage, are of increasing
   interest particularly if they are able to harness waste materials from
   other industries. The washed, tannin-rich, material resulting from Pinus
   radiata bark treated by steam-explosion, has been investigated as a
   potential filtration medium for removing microorganisms and protein
   contaminants from water and waste water. The steam-exploded bark
   effectively removed a test virus (bacteriophage MS2) from dechlorinated
   tap water when used as a filtration medium (>99.9\%) or when stirred in
   suspension (99\% within 10 min). Bacterial species (Escherichia coli and
   Enterococci faecalis) in the same experiments were removed well by
   filtration (>99.9\%) but stirring in bark suspension only reduced the
   initial titre by 55-62\% within 10 min. Treatment of bovine serum
   albumin (100 mg/l and 700 mg/l) with steam-exploded bark in suspension
   removed up to 95\% of the protein from solution. These results suggest
   that tannin rich steam-exploded bark products may have some application
   in treatment of protein rich effluents and those containing microbial
   contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the effect of the addition of effluents to a
   shallow freshwater reservoir used for irrigation, on the clogging
   capacity of the water. The clogging capacity was estimated with an
   instrument that measures the increasing differential pressure needed to
   maintain a constant flow of water through a 80 mu m screen filter. The
   dependence of the clogging capacity on plankton composition and
   suspended solids concentration was studied by means of multiple
   regression analysis, on four different arrangements of the matrix of
   data. The addition of effluents raised the clogging capacity sharply and
   quickly, The phenomenon was primarily due to an increase in the number
   of large algae and zooplankton species. These large species partially
   substituted for the small ones which were dominant before the entry of
   effluents. The concentration of suspended solids also affected the
   clogging capacity, but to a much lower extent. A relationship between
   the clogging capacity and the total number of plankton organisms was not
   found. The addition of plankton filter-feeding fish to the reservoir is
   recommended.}},

Abstract = {{The activated sludge flocs size variability and their size distribution
   were analyzed for the Aocs sizes larger than 10 mu m and for different
   intensities (rates) of bidirectional organic loading changes. Under
   these conditions the distributions of flee sizes expressed as average
   diameter and longest dimension fitted well the log-normal model. The
   logarithmic average flee size variability proved to be proportional to
   the loading if a time delay due to the inertia of biochemical and
   physical processes of activated sludge was taken into account. It has
   also been found that flocs larger than 50 mu m constituted the main
   source of the surface area and volume of the activated sludge. The tests
   performed have shown that organic loading strongly influences flee size
   distribution in the activated sludge process. The long-term loading
   changes caused larger disturbances to the floc size distribution than
   more rapid but shorter ones. Generally, after the substrate overload
   occurred, the flocs were more prone to breakup (pin-point flee effect).}},

   significant influence on HPC bacterial density, the supply water can be
   regarded as `'biologically stable''. However, reservoirs, in which water
   has an elevated residence time, have a significant impact on HPC
   bacterial density. The importance of regular reservoir and network
   maintenance is stressed. In spite of the `'biological stability'' of
   supply water, BDOC decrease vs residence time was observed for high
   water temperatures. Thresholds of nutrients for which no bacterial
   regrowth is observed must always be associated with temperature.
   Disinfectant residual, which rapidly disappears in the network, was seen
   to have a very limited role in `'biological stability''.}},

Abstract = {{The geochemical and granulometric characteristics of sediments from
   three sites in the Lot River basin contaminated by heavy metals
   (cadmium, lead and zinc) were studied over a period of three years.
   Total heavy metal concentrations show little variation with time.
   However, a correlation between the heavy metal concentration and the
   fraction of sediment particles smaller than 20 mu m in the Lot River at
   Capdenac-Gare, a moderately polluted site, shows the occurrence of
   yearly variations: concentrations are highest during the winter and
   spring, periods of high water discharge. Correlations between various
   components of the sediments and heavy metals indicate that the heavy
   metal content is probably not controlled by a single geochemical
   component but by several. Depending on the degree of contamination of
   the site (no pollution, moderate pollution or high pollution) and the
   heavy metal investigated, high metal concentrations may be associated to
   iron, manganese, organic and inorganic carbon, calcium, sulfide and
   small particles. Heavy metal transport in the Lot River, downstream from
   the confluence with the polluted Riou Mort, takes place mainly in
   particulate form. Zinc and Cd input is definitely related to the Riou
   Mort.}},

   fixed-culture nitrification-denitrification scheme short-circuiting the
   production of nitrate ion. The analysis of the behaviour of a submerged
   biofilter is reported for the development of a denitritation process.
   The results obtained show that the denitritation reaction takes place in
   the submerged biofilter according to apparently zero-order kinetics with
   a maximum nitrite removal rate of 2.1 kg NO2--N m(-3) of liquid phase .
   d(-1), corresponding to a maximum volumic loading of 1.1 kg NO2--N m(-3)
   of reactor . d(-1). The critical volumic loading applied (above which
   the denitritation yield fell) was 0.8 kg NO2--N m(-3) of reactor .
   d(-1). The carbon requirement in the form of acetate was estimated for
   denitritation as 0.84 kg soluble TOC . kg(-1)NO(2)(-)-N eliminated.
   Biological sludge was produced at a rate of 0.69 kg dry solids .
   kg(-1)NO(2)(-)-N removed. Finally, it was shown that the denitrifying

   The model parameters, two parameters, were evaluated using one set of
   experimental data obtained from the literature. The model was then used
   without adjusting any parameters to predict five other experimental data
   sets. The excellent predictive nature of model was validated for a wide
   range of fill to react period ratio (1/3:3/1) and also for a wide range
   of COD loading (340:3300 mg/l).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the structure and validation of the deterministic
   eutrophication model SALMOSED is discussed. It is applied to two lakes
   of different depths with a long history of cultural eutrophication. The
   simulation results are used to assess the short- and long-term
   efficiency of alternative measures for eutrophication control
   considering external and internal phosphorus loads. In the case of the
   shallow Lake Mueggelsee the control of the phosphorus release from the
   sediment by sediment dredging seems to be the only efficient method. To
   consolidate a mesotrophic steady state of Lake Mueggelsee in a long-term
   perspective, 10-year simulation runs show that single sediment dredging
   should be followed by a reduction of the external phosphorus load by at
   least 50\%. The eutrophication of the medium-deep Lake Yunoko can be
   controlled by a significant reduction of the effluent phosphorus
   concentration. Additionally it is recommended to control the
   considerable internal phosphorus load of Lake Yunoko by artificial
   aeration/destratification or the more costly sediment dredging.}},

Abstract = {{Coprecipitation of dissolved phosphate with calcite (CaCO3) has been
   observed in many lakes. In 1979/1980 white flocks occurred in Lake
   Veluwe after the inlet of water with a high calcium content. A high
   oversaturation with respect to calcite occurred at that time, presently
   (1985-1987) the oversaturation is much smaller. The intense
   photosynthesis decreased and maximum summer pH values came down from
   10.0 to about 8.5. In laboratory experiments the coprecipitation of
   phosphate with calcite occurred only when the crystalization was
   initiated by adding seeds of calcite. Literature and this research show
   that the incorporation efficiency of phosphate decreases at lower
   phosphate concentrations. Literature data for the incorporation of P in
   CaCO3 in mg P {[}g Ca](-1) are fitted as 10.9 x {[}P](0.5) with
   r(2)=0.50. The coprecipitation at the actual low phosphate concentration
   in Lake Veluwe (1993) is not as efficient as in the period 1985-1987.}},

Abstract = {{The potential generation of halogenated by-products, during the
   treatment of final effluent using peracetic acid (PAA) is described.
   Phenol was used as a model compound as it is an excellent acceptor of
   free radicals, readily undergoing chemical transformation to produce
   halogenated compounds. Increases in the concentration of monosubstituted
   chlorophenols following PAA treatment were apparent. The chlorophenols
   appear to be rapidly generated upon contact with the PAA, although
   by-product formation did not appear to be dependent on temperature or
   reaction contact time. The concentration of by-products was however,
   influenced by PAA dosage, chloride content and the concentration of
   organic and mineral constituents in the final effluent. It was
   demonstrated that PAA was unable to oxidise chloride to hypochlorous
   acid. It is therefore proposed that the transformation of phenol to
   chlorophenol occurs through the generation of free radicals, the
   initiation and promotion of which are dependent on the presence of other
   organic contaminants in the effluent. The formation of 2- and
   4-bromophenol demonstrated that the electrochemistry of PAA is, however,
   sufficient to oxidise bromide to hypobromous acid and subsequently form
   brominated organics.}},

Abstract = {{A rapid colorimetric method has been developed for the detection of
   faecal coliforms in sewage. The method is based on the hydrolysis of
   o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside by the bacterial enzyme
   beta-D-galactosidase and detection of liberated o-nitrophenol. Enzyme
   activity correlated well with numbers of faecal coliforms determined by
   conventional membrane filtration over a range of bacterial
   concentrations. A lower limit of 10(3) faecal coliforms per mi could be
   detected within 60 min. It is proposed that the method, which is
   amenable to automation, may be used asa surrogate for monitoring faecal
   coliform concentrations in sewage and a variety of effluents with a view
   to providing an early-warning indicator of sewage contamination or
   leakage.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed bacterial cultures from a wide variety of habitats were shown to
   be able to decolorize the diazo-linked chromophore of a highly coloured
   industrial effluent from the manufacture of nitrated stilbene sulphonic
   acid. Decolorization was favoured by strictly anaerobic conditions and
   highly proteinaceous media. 10\% v/v dilutions of the effluent with
   initial absorbances of IDD units at lambda(max) were rapidly
   decolorized-ca. 85\% in 2 days. When decolorized effluent was exposed to
   air it slowly developed a different colour which absorbed light more
   strongly in the visible region. The mechanisms involved in these
   processes and their implications for treatment of coloured effluents are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The molecular sewage indicator, coprostanol, was measured in bed
   sediments of the Mississippi River for the purpose of determining sewage
   contamination. Coprostanol is a non-ionic, non-polar, organic molecule
   that associates with sediments in surface waters, and concentrations of
   coprostanol in bed sediments provide an indication of long-term sewage
   loads. Because coprostanol concentrations are dependent on particle size
   and percent organic carbon, a ratio between coprostanol (sewage sources)
   and cholestanol + cholesterol (sewage and non-sewage sources) was used
   to remove the biases related to particle size and percent organic
   carbon. The dynamics of contaminant transport in the Upper Mississippi
   River are influenced by both hydrologic and geochemical parameters. A
   mass balance model incorporating environmental parameters such as river
   and tributary discharge, suspended sediment concentration, fraction of
   organic carbon, sedimentation rates, municipal discharges and
   coprostanol decay rates was developed that describes coprostanol
   concentrations and therefore, expected patterns of municipal sewage
   effects on the Upper Mississippi River. Comparison of the computed and
   the measured coprostanol concentrations provides insight into the
   complex hydrologic and geochemical processes of contaminant transport
   and the ability to link measured chemical concentrations with hydroiogic
   characteristics of the Mississippi River.}},

   degradation of acetate and propionate by mixed cultures of bacteria. The
   authors discuss their measurements in lab scale extended fixed bed
   reactors containing porous polyurethane particles of different sizes for
   the immobilization of anaerobic mixed cultures. It can be demonstrated
   that the influences of diffusion within the particles can be neglected
   for the reactors under study. The results for both acetate and
   propionate degradation can be fitted by Haldane kinetics using the
   unionized fatty acid as the actual substrate. Product inhibition of
   propionate degradation by acetate is shown and described as a

Abstract = {{Anaerobic methanogenic granules were stored under anaerobic condition at
   4 degrees and 22 degrees C for 1- to 18-month period to evaluate the
   effect of storage on degradation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs),
   including acetate, propionate and butyrate, and on methane production.
   The length of storage period affected the activities of different
   microbial trophic groups. During storage at 22 degrees C, the
   degradation rates for all the three acids decreased gradually. At low
   temperature (4 degrees C), reduction in degradation rates of acetate and
   propionate was relatively slower than that at 22 degrees C. Reduction in
   butyrate degradation rate was faster (by 45\%) during the first month of
   storage at 4 degrees C, but the rate declined afterwards. Nevertheless,
   the granules maintained, although at reduced level, their metabolic
   activities for all three VFAs even after storage for 18 months. Higher
   decay coefficients were obtained at 22 degrees C than those at 4 degrees
   C. For a relatively short period (1-5 months), granules can be stored at
   ambient temperature (approx. 20-22 degrees C) with limited loss in their
   VFA degradation rates. However, granules can maintain higher levels of
   VFA degradation rates when they are stored at low (4 degrees C) rather
   than at ambient temperature. Reactor studies indicated that the granules
   can completely recover their original VFA degradation rates in three
   days when stored for 31 d at 22 degrees C. The granules stored at 22
   degrees C for 9 months were used successfully as inoculum to start a
   laboratory-scale reactor. The original VFA degradation rates of the
   granules were achieved after 15-20 d of reactor operation at 35 degrees
   C.}},

Abstract = {{The present study deals with the analysis of mortality of Daphnia magna
   in chronic toxicity tests. Linear regression models were used to assess
   the possibility of predicting the probabilities of death over the long
   term on the basis of those recorded early in the toxicity test. The
   results based on data from toxicity tests with cadmium and pyridine,
   which yielded different mortality patterns over time, indicate that such
   predictions are practicable. These results suggest the feasibility of
   performing empirical relationships which would enable toxicologists to
   predict mortality over 21 days (usual length of the Daphnia magna
   chronic toxicity tests) and/or longer using the information obtained
   from shorter exposure to toxicants.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the solid degradation products formed in partially

   superior properties as a coagulant for treatment of some waters, suffers
   from instability as is evidenced by a precipitate which forms with age.
   The precipitate was found to contain aluminum and sulfate, but the ratio
   of these two species changed over time. It is suggested that the
   observed increase in sulfate content in the solids is consistent with
   the view that polymeric aluminum species are preferentially precipitated
   during the initial stages followed by monomeric species as degradation
   continues.}},

   from a variety of surface and ground waters, (2) laboratory and modeling
   studies of the pH dependence of the recovery of low molecular weight
   organic acids from dilute solutions, and (3) operational factors that

Abstract = {{The effect of hexavalent chromium on the growth rate of activated sludge
   bacteria was studied under chemostatic cultivation. Chromium (Cr-vi) in
   the range to 11 mg/l decreases the maximum growth rate mu(max) and
   increases the Monod constant K-s. Its effect can be described by a
   generalized form of the kinetic equation in the form
   mu(i) = mu(max)S(1 + pI)/S(1 + qI) + K-5(1 + rI).
   The values of mu(max), K-s, p, q, v were estimated as 0.5253 h(-1),

   87, 83 and 83\%, respectively, under the best conditions considered
   (average OLR = 13.8 g COD/1/d and average HRT = 3 h). The average

Abstract = {{The annual variability in atrazine concentrations and loadings have been
   studied for the St Lawrence River (Canada) and four of its tributaries.
   Hydrological parameters appear to be the principal controls on the
   loadings of atrazine in the St Lawrence River system throughout the
   year, except during the post-application period. In terms of the annual
   variability of loadings, prior to the application period, the spring
   freshet coincided with a major pulse of atrazine. A post-application
   peak load of atrazine was detected in the main river as well as in its
   tributaries. During the fall, atrazine loadings increased again. The
   results show that atrazine inputs to the system can be detected long
   after application. Average loadings in 1990 and 1991 were 7.7 and 4.4
   kg/d in the St Lawrences River, and 0.4 and 0.2 kg/d in the tributaries
   studied. The seasonal variation of atrazine concentrations in surface
   waters of the tributaries was consistent with the temporal distribution
   reported in the literature, viz. peak concentrations during the
   post-application period. There was also an increase in concentrations in
   the main river channel during the fall, reflecting the fact that the
   main river also receives inputs from the Great Lakes and not only from
   proximate agricultural sources. The annual variability in atrazine
   concentration and loading in the tributaries was directly related to the
   proximity of agricultural sources. Average concentrations in 1990 and
   1991 were 10.4 and 3.4 ng/l in the St Lawrence River, and 31.1 and 27.9
   ng/l in the tributaries. The persistence of atrazine is believed to be a
   key element controlling its dynamics in these aquatic systems. The
   results demonstrate the widespread dispersion of atrazine in this river
   basin, with similar responses and seasonal trends being exhibited
   throughout.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the flow balance method facility (FBM) used to
   control a combined sewer overflow (CSO) and a statistically based
   efficiency evaluation for the system. The FBM uses containment within a
   receiving water body (in this case seawater) to store CSO followed by
   pumpback to the wastewater treatment plant for treatment. The efficiency
   evaluation uses a mass balance incorporating measured specific
   conductivity and how volumes with their probability distributions in a
   Monte Carlo model to calculate probable volumes of seawater in the
   pumpback and hence efficiency of the system. The methods described in
   the paper refer to phase 1 and form the basis for monitoring phase 2 of
   the project. Important aspects of this analysis for phase 2 of the FBM
   demonstration included: confirmation of the reliability of specific
   conductivity to determine the volume of seawater in the pumpback; an
   indication of the sensitivity of the predicted efficiency to variation
   in the parameters used; and therefore, identification of the relative
   importance of the different data distributions to allow more effective
   data collection in phase 2.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing the level of dissolved organic carbon is an increasingly
   important goal in the treatment of drinking water. Dissolved organic
   carbon (DOG) compounds react with chemical disinfectants to form
   undesirable by-products, and DOC provides a substrate for bacterial
   growth. Chemicals used in water treatment processes and surface water
   reservoir management can cause the release of dissolved organics from
   photosynthetic aquatic organisms, and specific organic compounds can
   impart taste, odour and sometimes toxicity to treated water. Thus,
   chemical treatment of water may exacerbate the problem of dissolved
   organic carbon loading; The effects of several chemicals used at
   different stages of the water treatment process were studied on a
   nitrogen-fixing strain of the cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon flos-aquae.
   Chemicals included chlorine, potassium permanganate, aluminum sulphate,
   ferric chloride, calcium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide and copper
   sulphate. Physiological effects on Aphanizomenon, as quantified by its
   ability to fix nitrogen, were compared with cell membrane damage
   (manifested as potassium release) and the release of organic cellular
   components, including DOC and the specific odour compound, geosmin.
   Aluminum sulphate and ferric chloride did not cause either physiological
   toxicity, cell membrane damage or the release of DOC at treatment usage
   concentrations. Calcium hydroxide at low levels and hydrogen peroxide
   caused physiological toxicity, but only limited membrane damage, DOC and
   geosmin release. Chlorine, copper sulphate and potassium permanganate
   caused physiological damage with concomitant release of both DOC and
   geosmin at concentrations lower than those currently used in water
   treatment. Consequently, these last three chemicals create potential
   water treatment problems by releasing DOC and specific problem
   compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Brine wastes resulting from the regeneration of exhausted ion exchange
   resins require further treatment for final disposal. In this study, a
   mixed-culture entrapped microbial cell immobilization (EMCI) process for
   nitrate removal from brine wastes was examined. Because of the presence
   of elevated concentrations of sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate in
   the brine waste, the effects of high salt concentrations on the
   mixed-culture EMCI process and sludge production were investigated.
   Denitrification capacity of the mixed-culture EMCI process was found to
   be slightly affected at sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate
   concentrations up to 20 g/l. The process generally performs better than
   other biodenitrification processes in the presence of salt concentration
   typically required for the regeneration of ion exchange resins. The cell
   yields were estimated to be 0.11 g SS produced/g COD removal or 0.36 g
   SS produced/g nitrate-N removed. The mixed-culture EMCI process was
   found to be an economical alternative for treatment of brine wastes and
   exhibits a great potential to be coupled with an ion exchange process
   for complete nitrate removal. The proposed coupling represents a
   closed-loop treatment in which the brine waste from ion exchange
   processing is denitrified by the mixed-culture EMCI process and the
   denitrified effluent is recycled to regenerate exhausted resins,
   resulting in the reduction of salt requirements for regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{It was observed that when dissolved pentachlorophenol (PCP) at aqueous
   concentration between I and 10 mg/l was contacted with soil, organics
   from the soil surface were solubilized and soil colloids were
   stabilized. The stable soil colloids, identified microscopically as
   clays, retained beween 2.6\% and 13\% of the PCP depending on the PCP
   added and the soil type. The soil organics which were released from the
   soil surface, tentatively characterized as fulvic acids, increased with
   increasing PCP additions. These soil organics enhanced the solubility
   and decreased adsorption of pentachlorophenol due to cosolvency. These
   interactions appear to provide a mechanism for enhanced transport of
   contaminants in both ground and surface water through both colloidal
   transport and increased solubility when an organic contaminant is
   discharged or leaks into a soil-water system.}},

Abstract = {{Microbiological quality of shellfish production areas along the French
   coast is assessed through quantification of fecal coliforms, commonly
   used as indicators of fecal pollution. Their concentration is measured
   in filter-feeding molluscs, presumed to integrate highly fluctuating
   quantities of these germs from the surrounding filtrated water. In the
   context of a bacteriological monitoring network, knowledge of
   contamination spatial structures may help for further optimal sampling
   designs. This study aims at applying geostatistical techniques to
   describe and characterize the spatial structure of the fecal
   contamination in mussels (Mytilus edulis) over a given production area
   (Havre de la Vanlee, France), located in macrotidal waters. In
   comparison with common interpolation methods, the kriging estimator, a
   basic tool in geostatistics, presents the major advantage of providing
   unbiased estimates with known and minimum variances. It thus appears to
   be the most powerful procedure to produce contour maps for the
   concentration estimates and their standard deviations. Differences in
   mean concentration between the two conducted surveys are compared with
   differences in concentration found in continental inputs. Although two
   surveys are not sufficient to assess accurately spatio-temporal
   variabilities, the use of kriging reveals high spatial heterogeneity,
   with different structures and meteorological conditions from one survey
   to the other. This leads to questioning the validity of a monitoring
   based on a few sampling stations over a large area sampled monthly to
   estimate a mean bacteriological level.}},

Abstract = {{Low rate of anaerobic degradation together with inhibition problems
   caused by components such as milk fat and proteins were found to be
   reasons for restricted activity of high-rate anaerobic reactors operated
   with dairy effluent. The present research was aimed to investigate the
   influence of some relevant compounds, such as casein and milk fat and
   their degradation compounds, on process efficiency. Methanogenic
   activity and ATP content of the sludge were used as major follow up
   criteria for evaluating the influence of the tested compounds on process
   efficiency. It was found that casein was not degraded by anaerobic
   cultures which were not pre-acclimated for this compound. On the other
   hand, cultures acclimated to casein, utilized it very efficiently. Amino
   acids typical for casein degradation were also used efficiently with no
   inhibitory effects under the test conditions and with no need for
   culture pre-acclimatization. Milk fat was found to be a major cause for
   inhibition of methanogenic activity. It was found to have an immediate
   influence on reducing gas production rate in reactors to which it was
   added. Milk fat was also found to have long term effects: sludge
   pre-exposed to milk fat exhibited reduced methanogenic activity when
   tested in medium free of milk fat. Milk fat also reduced the ATP
   concentration in the sludge, indicating reduction of its total
   physiological activity. Oleic acid, which is a major derivative of milk
   fat hydrolysis was found to have inhibitory effects on methane
   production and on ATP concentration. According to the results of the
   present research, it would be advisable to treat dairy effluents by
   anaerobic digestion only after reduction of the milk fat concentration
   below 100 mg/L, and after careful acclimatization of the digester
   culture to casein.}},

Abstract = {{Foaming, an operational problem in activated sludge plants, is commonly
   caused by actinomycetes of the genera Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Gordona,
   Tsukamurella and Mycobacterium, and such foams are often referred to as
   Nocardia foams. This paper addresses conflicting reports about the
   temperature at which foaming occurs by determining the temperatures at
   which various nocardioforms will grow in pure culture. Strains tested
   included foam isolates, type strains of organisms reported in the
   literature to be involved In foaming, and type strains of related
   actinomycetes. The data showed that all three categories contained
   organisms that grew at 5 degrees C, and these were principally
   Rhodococcus spp. Thus the so-called Nocardia foams at low temperatures
   are more likely to be caused by Rhodococcus species. Although some foam
   isolates, especially Nocardia pinensis, grew over a relatively narrow
   range of temperatures, this growth range is still sufficient for them to
   cause problems in many plants. A few isolates grew at 40 degrees C or

Abstract = {{The photoreduction of Fe(III) in seawater (PH 8.1) has been investigated
   over a range of natural sunlight intensities at 5, 10 and 15 degrees C
   in the presence of hydroxycarboxylic acid (HCA), such as sugar acids.
   The Fe(III) photoreduction abilities of HCA were in the order: glucaric
   acid-1,4-lactone = glucaric > tartaric > gluconic >> citric > glyceric =
   malic > glucuronic acids. The order probably depends on the complexation
   ability of HCA with Fe(III) in seawater and the photo-activity of
   Fe(III)-HCA complex. Stable soluble Fe(III)-glucaric complex systems
   indicated a reversible photochemical reaction
   {[}soluble Fe(III)-HCA complex hv over reversible arrow Fe(II) + L{*}
   (L{*}: oxidation products of HCA)].
   The photoreduction rate constant (k(red)) was estimated from the
   oxidation rate constant (k(red)) of Fe(II) in the presence of glucaric
   form and steady state Fe(II) concentration assuming first-order
   processes. The photoreduction rate constant increases linearly with
   increasing light intensity and is independent of temperature. The
   photoreduction mechanism is probably a photoinduced ligand to metal
   charge transfer (LMCT) reaction. For colloidal hydrous ferric oxide-HCA
   systems, the net photoreduction rate probably depends on the surface
   concentration of adsorbed HCA on colloidal ferric oxide (surface
   complexation), the back oxidation rate of photoproduced Fe(II), and
   hydrolytic precipitation rate of reoxidized Fe(III) in seawater
   remaining HCA. These above interpretations are supported from the
   observed shift in the Fe(III)-HCA absorption spectra measured before and
   after each photo-experiment. The photoreduction of Fe(III)-HCA complex
   systems is probably promoted by the absorption at longer ultraviolet
   (u.v.) wavelengths (290-400 nm) of sunlight by the second absorption
   band centered at 310 nm observed in the spectra of soluble Fe(III)-HCA
   complexes in seawater.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of BOD, GOD, and TOC of secondary effluents under varied
   concentrations of chlorine, was investigated. The three parameters were
   measured in final effluents treated with chlorine dosages in the range
   of 2-50 mg l(-1) and 30 min contact time followed by dechlorination with
   sodium thiosulfate. Chlorine dosages above 10 mg 1(-1) resulted in
   increased BOD and COD levels of the effluent, with chlorine dosages
   above 30 mg l(-1) resulted in almost double the original BOD and COD
   values. TOC measurements showed obvious stability against chlorine
   impact, which makes TOC a better indicator for the organic content of
   wastewater. Almost all the observed increase in BOD measurements could
   be attributed to modification of the dissolved part of the organic
   matter by chlorine. Effects of chlorine on BOD and COD were also
   confirmed by actual data reported by the treatment plant. The results
   also show that the response of BOD and COD to chlorination is a function
   of chlorine dosage and the organic content of wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{With the industrial development and urban construction in Madinat
   Al-Jubail Alsinaiya in Saudi Arabia, which has mostly arid regions and
   due to limited water resources depends on diminishing ground water and
   costly desalinated seawater, wastewater reuse is pursued using reclaimed
   municipal and industrial wastewater through treatment plants.
   This paper is an actual case study discussing the features of reuse, the
   processes used and the standards adopted. The effect of reuse upon the
   local environment is commented upon. This study also emphasizes the
   cost-competitiveness of wastewater reuse for irrigation in Saudi Arabia.
   Design data and operational results for the 19 MGD municipal wastewater
   water treatment plant and the 11 MGD industrial wastewater treatment
   plant will be discussed. Both plants utilize biological treatment
   followed by pressure filtration to meet the stringent standards
   governing the use of effluent in landscape irrigation. The effluent TDS,
   TSS, BOD, and SAR are valued 936, 4.4, 2.7, and 7.4, respectively, for

Abstract = {{A total of 68 strains of filamentous bacteria belonging to the genera
   Sphaerotilus and Haliscomenobacter, Eikelbooms types 021N, 1701, some
   nocardioform organisms in addition to some unidentified, Gram-negative
   pink-pigmented isolates were studied qualitatively and quantitatively
   for their growth requirements and growth response to different
   nutrients. With the exception of type 021N, all isolates grew better
   with D-fructose and D-glucose, than with acetate as sole carbon source.
   Acetate concentrations > 1.0 gl(-1) inhibited all isolates and
   Haliscomenobacter and the pink-pigmented strains did not grow at all
   with acetate. With the exception of Haliscomenobacter isolates, growth
   of the majority of strains was stimulated by low peptone and yeast
   extract concentrations (0.05-0.5 gl(-1)). Haliscomenobacter strains did
   not grow in the presence of yeast extract and peptone. For all isolates
   a strict requirement for calcium, and (to some extent) magnesium was
   observed. Below a concentration of 20 mg l(-1) Ca and 0.1 mg-l(-1) Mg
   only few strains were able to show visible growth. The Haliscomenobacter
   isolates were not able to grow in media containing < 25 mg l(-1)Ca and 5
   mg l(-1) Mg. All isolates did not grow in media containing < 1 mg l(-1)
   NH4-N, and 2.5 mg l(-1) P. Often group or genus specific growth
   requirements were recorded, indicating that the occurrence of one type
   of filamentous organisms in bulking sludge can be associated with a
   specific nutrient mixture in the activated sludge.}},

Abstract = {{Water samples analysed for Legionella sp. by a commercial company were
   studied over a 6 month period. Samples yielding legionella were
   re-examined to determine the efficiency of heat or acid pre-treatment in
   isolating legionella compared to untreated specimens. In addition, more
   than one colony of each colony type were tested serologically to
   determine whether serotypes in addition to those originally identified
   were present. Significantly (P < 0.01) higher legionella colony numbers
   were found on the heat pre-treatment plates than on the acid
   pre-treatment plates. Legionellae were identified from only the
   untreated plate in 5.1\% of positive water samples; in these instances
   the concentrations of legionellae tended to be low. Six out of 18
   positive samples were found to contain more than one serogroup of
   Legionella pneumophila when more than one colony of each colony type was
   tested. It is recommended that the procedures used in legionella
   screening be rationalised to facilitate maximum detection without
   excessive workload.}},

Abstract = {{An aerobic Jet Loop Reactor (JLR) activated sludge process of 541.
   volume was used to investigate its suitability for the treatment of
   industrial wastewaters, specifically brewery wastewater. A loading rate
   of 50 kg COD/m(3) . d was achieved with 97\% COD removal for a period of
   5 weeks and although the settleability was found to be acceptable
   non-flocculating motile bacteria caused the effluent to be cloudy and
   have a high suspended solids concentration in the order of 200-350 mg/l.
   Investigations into how this loading rate was achievable and its
   consequences included measurements of oxygen transfer rate, Specific
   Oxygen Uptake Rate (SOUR), determination of Monod kinetic coefficients
   and microscopic examination. Oxygen transfer rates were found to be
   high, with a low energy efficiency possibly due to the small scale of
   the rig, SOUR values varied between 100-400 mg O-2/g VSS . h for F/M
   ratios of 5-8 kg COD/kg MLVSS . d and the maximum growth rate was found
   to be 12.2/d with a yield of 0.4 kg VSS produced/kg COD removed.
   Although the Jet Loop Reactor was found to be a suitable method for
   pretreating brewery wastewater, an effluent polishing stage before final
   discharge to a water course would be necessary and it was concluded that
   further investigations into jet design may increase the oxygen transfer
   efficiency and quality of effluent.}},

   The method uses solid-phase extraction with octadecyl-bonded silica
   cartridges followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry under
   discharge-assisted thermospray ionisation. The method was found to
   provide satisfactory performance with respect to the requirements of the
   drinking water supply regulations in the U.K., with limits of detection
   of 0.04-0.05 mu gl(-1), relative standard deviations of better than 10\%
   and recoveries of 99-116\% at pesticide concentrations around the
   prescribed concentration (0.1 mu gl(-1) for single pesticides).}},

Abstract = {{Among the various alternatives to enhance the octane rating of gasoline,
   methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) has become increasingly the compound of
   choice. Due to its high solubility in water there are some environmental
   concerns related to the remediation of waters contaminated with gasoline
   containing MTBE. Although MTBE is difficult to treat economically with
   conventional techniques, it has been found to be readily degraded
   photocatalytically. In batch TiO2 slurries and under the experimental
   conditions used in these experiments MTBE degradation proceeded with an
   initial pseudo first-order rate constant of 1.2 x 10(-3) s(-1). The
   primary by-products of this reaction have been identified as t-butyl
   formate and t-butyl alcohol, both of which are also readily degraded
   photocatalytically, albeit at slightly slower rates than MTBE. Mass
   balance calculations have shown that MTBE is virtually completely
   mineralized and a reaction scheme is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Parameters used for anaerobic process control include volatile acids,
   COD, gas volume and composition. Measuring headspace trace gases
   (hydrogen and carbon monoxide) are becoming more common in anaerobic
   research. For economy, it is important to know whether a single
   parameter (hydrogen, carbon monoxide or volatile acids) can be
   sufficient for process control. In this research, 4-nitrophenol (4-Np)
   inhibited, anaerobic, propionate fed, chemostats were used to study the
   limitation of using (i) headspace hydrogen (or carbon monoxide) or (ii)
   effluent volatile acids (acetate and propionate) as monitoring
   parameters. It was found that hydrogen utilizing methanogens were not
   affected with up to 66 mg/l 4-Np at 16-day SRT and with up to 33 mg/l at
   10-day SRT. This led to no hydrogen accumulation even though acetate and
   propionate accumulated significantly showing inhibition of both
   propionate-utilizing acetogens and acetate-utilizing methanogens. This
   shows that hydrogen measurements alone would be misleading in this case.
   Measurement of both volatile acids and hydrogen is recommended unless
   prior comparative knowledge is available on the effects of a toxicant on
   propionate-, acetate- and hydrogen-utilizers. CO went up to 3 ppm from
   0.8 ppm with a spike of 66 mg/l 4-Np at 16-day SRT. In most cases CO was
   not very useful as a monitoring parameter.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of volatile fatty acids and trimethylamine on denitrification
   activity of activated sludge was studied in laboratory batch
   experiments. Formic acid had no effect on the denitrification rates.
   Acetic acid, n-butyric acid and trimethylamine all enhanced the rates.
   Acetate is the compound with the strongest effect, n-butyric acid has a
   moderate effect, while TMA only have a small effect in stimulating the
   rates. Propionic, isobutyric, n-valeric, isovaleric and caproic acid
   inhibit denitrification, nitrate reduction being more inhibited than
   nitrite reduction. The inhibitor concentration, K-I, at which activity
   falls to 50\% of the activity measured when no inhibiting compound were
   present, were determined by modelling. K-I values for nitrate reduction,
   in a media not supplemented with an easily metabolised electron donor,
   were found to be 74 mM for propionic, 30 mM for isobutyric, 36 mM for
   n-valeric, 18 mM for isovaleric and 105 mM for caproic acid. K-I values
   for nitrite reduction were found to be 196 mM for propionic, 32 mM for
   isobutyric, 57 mM for n-valeric, 18 mM for isovaleric and 110 mM for
   caproic acid. Inhibition of the rate of hydrolysis could not be
   determined. Anaerobically treated wastewaters from fish, potato and
   onion industries all stimulated denitrification. Reject water from
   anaerobic treatment of excess sludge had no significant effect on the
   denitrification processes. For isobutyric, isovaleric and n-valeric acid
   the undissociated compounds appear to act as the inhibitor. For
   propionic acid it could not be assessed whether the degree of inhibition
   were determined by the undissociated or the total concentration of the
   inhibitor.}},

Abstract = {{A novel adsorbent was prepared and its adsorption properties for nitric
   acid were studied. The adsorbent with a phosphonic acid dibutyl
   ester-type active group was prepared by chloromethylating
   styrene/divinylbenzene copolymer of different divinylbenzene content
   following phosphorylation. Column method was used for the adsorption
   experiment. The adsorbent adsorbed nitric acid preferentially in acidic
   solution and adsorbed nitric acid was desorbed by rinsing the adsorbent
   with water. The amount of nitric acid adsorbed increased almost linearly
   with nitric acid concentration in solution up to approx. 2 M. The
   adsorbent apparently did not adsorb nitric acid in dilute solution less
   than approx. 0.1 M, since the isotherm did not pass through the origin.
   Maximum amount of nitric acid was nearly equal to the active group
   content of the adsorbent. Colons of nitric acid enhanced nitric acid
   adsorption though sodium chloride without colons of nitric acid was not
   adsorbed and had no effect on nitric acid adsorption. The product of
   total acid concentration and total nitrate concentration ({[}H].{[}NO3])
   demonstrated the effects of both ions simultaneously on nitric acid
   adsorption and accounted for the adsorption. A plot of nitric acid
   adsorbed vs {[}H].{[}NO3] gave a single curve under various experimental
   conditions. Nitric acid adsorbed increased linearly with {[}H].{[}NO3]
   up to 0.4, the slope of the curve subsequently became gradual, and a
   plateau was observed when {[}H].{[}NO3] exceeded 30. Divinylbenzene
   content of starting gel adversely affected nitric acid adsorption, and
   adsorbed nitric acid decreased with increase in DVB content. The novel
   adsorbent proved useful for the removal, recovery and purification of
   nitric acid or nitrate ion in effluent treatment or manufacturing
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Sorption of the organic pollutants phenol, 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, and
   tannic acid (Fluka) onto montmorillonite-based sorbents was studied. The
   sorbents were homoionic Na- or Ca-montmorillonite, montmorillonite
   completely exchanged with the cationic organic surfactant
   dimethyldistearylammonium chloride (or DDA-M), and DDA-M partially
   re-exchanged with Ca2+ (Ca-DDA-M). The influence of pH on sorption of
   phenol and trichlorophenol was also investigated. The sorption
   capacities for phenol, trichlorophenol, and tannic acid were
   significantly enhanced by surfactant treatment of the homoionic clay.
   Uptake onto the organoclays increased in the order phenol < tannic acid
   < trichlorophenol, which corresponds to the order of increasing
   hydrophobicity. The significant role played by hydrophobicity was also
   observed in pH effects which generally favored sorption when the pH was
   low enough to assure that the uncharged (protonated) species was
   predominant. In the case of trichlorophenol, sorption could be shown to
   be quantitatively attributable to the neutral species. The results of
   X-ray diffraction measurements showed increased d001 spacings when the
   DDA was intercalated into the interlamellar spaces, increasing the
   available sorbent porosity. This, and the linkage of uptake to solute
   hydrophobicity, indicates that uptake is by a partitioning mechanism,
   though non-linear isotherms may be caused by site limitations.
   Surprisingly, if a portion of the intercalated DDA is removed by
   exchange with Ca2+, the d001 spacing decreases but the sorption capacity
   of the organoclays is improved. One possible mechanism is improved
   elementary sheets cohesion due to calcium ions, imparting molecular
   sieve characteristics to the solid. The extent and possible selectivity
   of sorption using these organoclays suggests that they may provide an
   alternative to activated carbon sorbents in water treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The toxicity bioassay employing Photobacterium phosphoreum (LUMISTOX
   system) was used to evaluate the evolution of the quality of the River
   Tormes water during its passage through the city of Salamanca. To do so
   the toxicity of all the discharges into the river Tormes (22 total) were
   studied in the stretch in question, together with the impact of such
   discharges on the river course. Since pollution at low concentrations or
   the toxicity due to compounds that are strongly diluted in a fast
   flowing river may go undetected by the system,a technique of organic
   microcontaminant concentration using XAD-2 resins was used to detect
   different degrees of toxicity along the stretch studied. To a greater or
   lesser extent, all the discharges analyzed proved to be toxic for the
   photobacteria; the impact to the river caused by each was found to be a
   function of its EC50 and flow rate (Equitox/m(3)). The toxicity of the
   water of the river increases (the inhibition of luminescence (\%H15),
   the dilution factor that inhibits luminescence by 20\% (G120) and the
   concentration values leading to a 50\% decrease in the emission of light
   (EC50) for an incubation time of 15 min, increase) as the river receives
   the different discharges, from the first sample (before the discharges
   studied), where the water concentrate has a low effective concentration
   50 value (EC50 = 1.3) until the last sample (after the discharges
   studied), where the effective concentration 50 value is maximum (EC50 =
   2.9).}},

Abstract = {{Hexachlorocyclopentadiene (C5Cl6) is an intermediate in the production
   of cyclodiene pesticides and flame retardants. To test the treatability
   in a chemical production waste stream, hexachlorocyclopentadiene was
   tested as a substrate for direct photolysis and for sensitized
   photo-oxidation in this laboratory study. The initial
   hexachlorocyclopentadiene concentration was 100 mg/l in aqueous buffers.
   Direct photolysis experiments were at pH values 5, 7.4, 9.2, and 11.
   Riboflavin and methylene blue were used as sensitizers. Samples in batch
   reactors were exposed to Durotest Vitalite(R) lights in the laboratory
   and the hexachlorocyclopentadiene concentration decreased in all
   samples. Based on first order kinetic rates for the photodegradation of
   hexachlorocyclopentadiene, riboflavin at 5 mg/l was the best removal
   treatment, with an average photodegradative half-life of 47 min after
   light exposure in the laboratory compared to a 100 min half-life for
   direct photolysis after light exposure in the laboratory. This
   corresponds to quantum yields of 0.76 and 0.49, respectively. Four
   photoproduct peaks were identified by GC/MS analysis of methylene
   chloride extracts. The major photoproduct in the direct photolysis
   samples and in the riboflavin sensitized samples was
   hexachlorocyclopentenone (C5Cl6O). The major photoproduct in the
   methylene blue sensitized samples was a compound containing C4Cl4,
   either tetrachlorobutadiene (C4H2Cl4) or tetrachlorobutyne (C4Cl4).}},

Abstract = {{A field study was conducted to determine the mass flow of secondary
   alkane sulfonate (SAS) surfactants in a municipal wastewater treatment
   plant. The concentration of SAS in samples of sewage (raw sewage,
   primary and secondary effluent) was determined using solid-phase
   extraction with C-18 disks and injection port derivatization with gas
   chromatography/mass selective detection (GC/MS). The concentration of
   SAS in raw and anaerobically-digested sludge was determined by
   ion-pair/supercritical fluid extraction and injection-port
   derivatization GC/MS. The removal of SAS from the waste stream is
   efficient (99.7\%) with approximately 16\% (w/w) transferred to sludge.
   Given current Swiss sludge disposal regulations, a maximum of
   approximately 350 mg m(-2) SAS are applied every three years to a given
   section of agricultural soil. Of the total SAS mass flow entering the
   treatment plant, an average of 0.3\% (w/w) is discharged to the adjacent

Abstract = {{Fifteen enteroviruses (EVs) previously isolated from Tyrrhenian sea
   water samples were used. They were first identified by traditional
   dot-blot and Northern-blot hybridizations with a group of cDNA probes
   from cloned Poliovirus 1 and Coxsackievirus B4 and oligodeoxynucleotides
   complementary to echovirus 6 and 9 sequences. Using both wild viruses
   and known enteroviruses a reverse-PCR protocol was then set up followed
   by cDNA sequencing of the fragments generated. The sequences of primers
   were selected from a consensus of several 5' non-coding ends of
   enterovirus genomes, representing highly conserved regions. The
   downstream (region 577-603) and the upstream (region 436-465)
   oligonucleotide primers carried an extra sequence in order to generate
   BamHI and a HindIII restriction sites at the 5' and 3' end respectively
   of the amplified cDNA fragments for directional cloning in a plasmid.
   The downstream 5'NC primer was 5'-biotinylated in order to allow direct
   sequencing of the amplicon, when possible, after strand separations on
   streptavidin coated magnetic beads. The PCR of reverse transcribed viral
   RNAs resulted in a 167-170 b.p. cDNA product on ethidium bromide-stained
   2\% agarose gels in all the samples and reference viruses. The test is
   negative on reoviruses, hepatitis A and uninfected BGM cells and detects
   < 1 TCID50 viral particles. Sequences of cloned fragments were compared
   with sequences of cloned enteroviruses stored in commercial data banks.
   The 5'NC region of a reference echovirus 5 was also cloned and sequenced
   to improve the comparison. On the basis of deduced genetic distances,
   three poliovirus 1, eight coxsakievirus B5, four coxsakievirus B1 were
   diagnosed. One poliovirus Sabin 2 was isolated together with a
   coxsackievirus-related strain in the same lysate sample. The reliability
   and sensitivity of this RT-PCR method makes it an attractive approach to
   virus detection in environmental samples.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of several operating parameters (reagents concentration,
   molar ratio, mixing protocol) on the composition and aging of the
   precipitates obtained by mixing cupric sulfate solutions with NaOH
   solutions was studied. The precipitate was characterized with chemical
   analysis (SO4/Cu molar ratio), scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray
   diffraction. pH, free cupric ion activity, and sulfate concentration
   were measured in the soluble phase. Precipitation of either basic cupric
   sulfates or cupric hydroxide/oxide may take place depending on the
   sequence of reagents addition. Provided that the base/CuSO4 molar ratio
   does not exceed 1.5, the slow addition of base to dilute CuSO4 solutions
   produces either pure posnjakite {[}CuSO4 . 3Cu(OH)2 . H2O] or posnjakite
   and brochantite {[}CuSO4 . 3Cu(OH)(2)] mixtures. Upon aging, posnjakite
   converts to the more stable brochantite, in agreement with previous
   works indicating posnjakite as a kinetic precursor of brochantite. The
   addition of excess base to the basic salt induces its slow conversion to
   tenorite (CuO), changing the morphology of the precipitate from
   platelet-like basic salt particles to feathery bundles of tenorite
   needles. Aged precipitate suspensions contain brochantite or tenorite,
   the predicted stable solids at lower and higher pH, respectively.
   However, the actual predominance region of brochantite seems to extend
   itself, by at least one pH unit, over the tenorite predominance region
   predicted by the geochemical model MINTEQA2. This discrepancy has been
   attributed to the small dimensions, and consequent higher solubility, of
   tenorite crystals. Potentiometric measurements on aged tenorite
   suspensions support this hypothesis, indicating a solubility product of
   about one order of magnitude higher than expected. The results of this
   work can help to understand and control the formation and conversion of
   basic cupric sulfates, that are of great importance in such fields as
   removal and recovery of copper from industrial wastewaters and sludges,
   and patina formation in copper corrosion.}},

   The reaction was pH dependent, the optimum range being 4.0-7.0. Langmuir
   and Freundlich isotherms, established for various initial nickel
   concentrations and for a range of pH values, were used to obtain a
   single relationship between initial metal concentration, metal removal,
   and initial pH. The latter was found to control efficiency of nickel
   removal. Kinetic data suggested involvement of a chemical rate-limiting
   step, and a predictive relationship was derived relating nickel removal
   to peat dose. In comparison with other metals, nickel removal is poor,
   and possible reasons are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Following the operation of three laboratory-scale slow sand filters,
   containing three different sand grain sizes, over a period of 2 years
   samples of the sand were taken from each of the filters from nine
   different depths below the surface. These samples were initially shaken
   in a small volume of water to detach any accumulated solids. The
   suspended solids content and the turbidity of the carriage water was
   then determined. In addition all sand samples were examined for
   particulate organic carbon (POC) and for the bacterial content by means
   of a standard plate count, as well as being observed both by a scanning
   electron microscope (SEM) and by means of epifluorescence microscopy
   (EM). Of these techniques it was the determination of the bacteria
   shaken free from the sand grains which gave the most reproducible
   results. No worthwhile results were obtained as a result of EM but the
   SEM proved to be a valuable support for the quantitative techniques
   employed. The presence of organic solids was demonstrated throughout the
   depths of all three filters while generally there was a noticeable
   reduction in the number of bacteria below the depth of 400 mm.}},

Abstract = {{The results of an extended investigation into the operation of a
   stabilization pond system in the Cayman Isles, incorporating an
   appreciably saline wastewater, were used to discover any correlations
   existing between a number of wastewater, pond and environmental factors
   and four different reaction coefficients employable in the first-order,
   complete-mix equation for the design of ponds. The four reaction
   coefficients included are derived using the BOD5 results for unfiltered
   inlet and outlet samples (ufk), another derived using the unfiltered
   inflow samples but filtered outflow samples (uffk), a third calculated
   employing filtered inflow and outflow samples (fk) and the fourth was
   derived from the inflow and outflow counts of faecal coliforms (k(b)).
   In the first stage of statistical analysis, no reliable simple
   correlations were discovered between any of the k values and any one of
   the individual pond, wastewater or environmental factors employed.
   However, two further stages involving Stepwise Backward Selection and
   Hierarchical Multiple Regression produced reliable models for ufk, uffk,
   jk and k(b) for the ponds in the system in which log k, was dependent on
   the rate of inflow and the log of the faecal coliforms concentration and
   ufk, uffk and fk were influenced by solar radiation, rainfall, faecal
   coliform concentrations, BOD loading and pond depth. Only two design
   equations could finally be selected. These were for uffk and k(b) for
   facultative ponds.}},

   changes in the course of heterotrophic denitrification. The decisive
   parameter for these balances for undissociated substrates is average
   oxidation number of carbon (AONC). For dissociated substrates the
   balances are influenced by the composition of organic compounds (the
   number of C, H, O atoms and the oxidation number). The rules for
   determination of pH value changes according to substrate composition are
   discussed both for dissimilative and assimilative reactions. The
   theoretical conclusions are verified in kinetic denitrification tests
   with selected organic compounds (glucose, glycerine, ethanol, methanol,
   acetate, endogenous substrate). Furthermore, indication of nitrates and
   nitrites removal (the end of denitrification) by continuously measured
   pH is described (when denitrification has been finished, pH value begins
   to decrease).}},

Abstract = {{The rates of recovery of E.coli previously exposed to a sub-lethal dose
   of germicidal u.v. radiation have been investigated. The influence of
   salinity and temperature on both the rates of dark repair and
   photoreactivation were investigated in order to assess the relative
   recovery of disinfected effluent released into coastal waters. The
   photoreactivation rates followed an Arrhenius relationship for samples
   reactivated in an isotonic medium and reached a maximum of 52\% recovery
   of the viable cell count present before u.v. treatment. For those cells
   in a saline environment reactivation was slower and a lower maximum
   recovery was obtained. Dark repair rates were extremely limited in those
   cells exposed to the saline environment which was produced from
   synthetic sea water. A maximum recovery of 8\% over a nine hour period
   was achieved. It is concluded that less reactivation by E.coli is likely
   within u.v. treated effluent disposed of into coastal environments. The
   levels of reactivation are however dependent upon the temperature and
   salinity of those waters.}},

   specifically using C-13-labeled their respective internal standards and
   a selected ion monitoring method of high resolution gas chromatograph
   mass spectrometry (GC/MS). These compounds were found in all samples
   analyzed. The average concentrations of the total Co-PCBs, PCDDs and
   PCDFs in the 10 sediment samples taken from reservoir ponds were 83,
   3900 and 360 pg/g of dry weight, respectively, those in 7 sediments from
   irrigation ponds were 96, 3200, and 96 pg/g, those in 10 sediments from
   an irrigation pond near an incineration facility were 260, 10,000, and
   290 pg/g, respectively, and those in the soil from a paddy field near an
   incineration facility were 120, 96,000, and 4700 pg/g, respectively. The
   concentrations of Co-PCBs, PCDDs and PCDFs in the sediments of the
   irrigation pond were higher than those in the sediments of any other
   ponds. On the other hand, the concentrations of PCDDs in the paddy field
   soil were much higher than those in any other sediment samples, but the
   Co-PCB concentration was about one-half of those in the sediments of an
   irrigation pond near the facility. These findings suggest that one of
   pollution sources of Co-PCBs as well as PCDDs and PCDFs, was municipal
   waste incineration, but that Co-PCB pollution was not caused by
   herbicides applied in the past.}},

Abstract = {{Characteristics of floating media filtration were examined to develop a

   characteristically has a high void ratio (90\%) and a low specific
   gravity (0.93). Experiments with bench scale and pilot scale filters
   showed that the removal rates of pollutants were 80-90\% for suspended
   solids and 44\% for BOD5 under an operating condition of 1000 m/day of
   flow velocity and 2-3 mg/l of cationic polyelectrolyte addition. Mass
   capture reached 7-10 kg/m(3) with a low head loss, less than 0.2 m, with
   a media depth of 2 m. High removal rate of suspended solids and low head
   loss should be principal advantages of the process.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption of quinoline from aqueous solutions onto combusted Rundle
   spent shale shows that the adsorption isotherm is of Langmuir type
   (L-4). Cations which are leached from the spent shale or which are in
   retort water (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, NH4+) have a marked effect on the
   adsorption. The sulphate anions have a small effect, while chloride
   anions have almost no effect on the adsorption. The adsorption of the
   base is mainly attributed to the formation of quinoline-metal ion
   complexes that result from coordination/protonation mechanisms rather
   than simply to cation exchange of the quinolinium ion. It is noted that
   this study did not attempt to delineate the relative importance of
   coordination and protonation mechanisms. Thus the two mechanisms are
   lumped together and regarded as an Important property of the system. The
   ionic potential is used to scale the importance of
   coordination/protonation in the adsorption process. The mechanism of
   proton transfer to the quinoline molecule could be important for the
   adsorption of quinoline in ammonium solutions.}},

Abstract = {{In the Plain of Reeds in the Mekong delta (Viet Nam) about 600,000 ha is
   covered by pyrite soils. At the beginning of the rainy season acidic
   material is leached from the soil to water in the canal system.
   Evaluation of water chemistry data indicate that jurbanite is the acidic
   mineral which is accumulated at the soil surface and subsequently
   leached to the canals during the early rains. The results obtained
   correspond well with published results for acidic soils in other areas.
   It has earlier been assumed that Fe(II) is the major acidic ion in the
   water and oxidized slowly. The measurements made in acidic canal
   indicate that Fe(II) is oxidized to Fe(III) according to a pseudo
   first-order reaction with a half-time of about 4 h and precipitated as
   hydroxide. Instead aluminium, produced by weathering, has proved to be
   the most acidic ion in the water.}},

Abstract = {{The suitability of the application of the tangential flow filtration
   system (TFF) for the concentration of living freshwater phytoplankton
   for water treatment studies was examined. We investigated the capability
   of a TFF system, equipped with a 0.45 mu m pore-size membrane, to
   concentrate algae from large volumes of reservoir water characterized by
   low algal biomass. The samples examined were concentrated 5 to 40 times.
   The assessment criteria of systems's performance were algal recovery
   rates and cell viability. It was found that large volumes of water could
   be processed without problems. The algal recovery was high and
   correlated to the applied concentration factor and the prevailing algal
   species. An overall algal biomass recovery of 70-89 percent was found.
   The assessment of algal viability in the concentrated samples was based
   on the growth rates and degree of preservation of their complex
   structure and other properties that affect their behaviour in water
   treatment. Algal cells in the concentrated samples and in natural
   reservoir water were found to be identical, with all delicate cell
   structures undamaged. Motile species preserved their active locomotion,
   Algal reproduction capacity was not affected by the concentration
   process. The results obtained confirm that the TFF system is a powerful
   apparatus for the preparation of model waters to be used in experimental
   algal-related water treatment studies.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure has been developed to improve the accuracy of an existing
   mechanistic model of the activated sludge process, previously described
   by Lessard and Beck {[}Wat. Res. 27, 963-978 (1993)]. As a first step,
   optimization of the numerous model parameters has been investigated
   using the downhill simplex method in order to minimize the sum of the
   squares of the errors between predicted and experimental values of
   appropriate variables. Optimization of various sets of parameters has
   shown that the accuracy of the mechanistic model; especially on the
   prediction of the dissolved oxygen (DO) in the mixed liquor, can be
   easily improved by adjusting only the values of the overall oxygen
   transfer coefficients, K(L)a. Then, in a second step, neural network
   models have been used successfully to predict the remaining errors of
   the optimized mechanistic model. The coupling of the mechanistic model
   with neural network models resulted in a hybrid model yielding accurate
   simulations of five key variables of the activate sludge process.}},

Title = {{INFLUENCE OF THE PREVIOUS STAY OF ESCHERICHIA-COLI AND SALMONELLA SPP IN
   WASTE-WATERS ON THEIR SURVIVAL IN SEAWATER}},

Abstract = {{Sewage treatment plants are designed to purify wastewaters for given
   parameters, but their microbiological effectiveness is often poor
   without addition of a specific treatment (disinfection, filtration,
   etc.). Large amounts of enteric bacteria are thus released into the
   environment, in rivers and seawater. Is their subsequent survival in
   these hostile environments influenced by their previous stay in
   wastewaters? In order to assess this potential adaptation, we studied
   the behavior of E. coli, S. typhimurium and S. manhattan in seawater
   microcosms, with and without a previous 24 to 72 h stay in raw and
   treated wastewaters. The seawater and wastewater media were 0.22 pm
   filtered and autoclaved. The protocol followed is outlined in Fig. 1. At
   each step, bacteria were harvested by filtration and re-suspended in the
   following medium. All microcosms were maintained at 20 degrees C, in the
   dark. Seven experiments were carried out, testing seven different
   wastewaters. The survival of the inoculated bacteria in seawater during
   6 days was monitored by plate counts on trypticsoy agar and by acridine
   orange epifluorescence counts (Hobble et al., 1977). In two experiments,
   the bacterial enzymatic activity was assessed before and after the stay
   in seawater, using APIZYM kits. S. typhimurium's survival in seawater
   was increased when cells had previously spent 24 h in raw wastewaters,
   and 24 and 48 h in treated wastewaters (Fig. 3). The culturable count
   was about 2 log units higher after 6 days. The same phenomenon was
   observed for S. manhattan tested in two raw wastewaters (Fig. 4). For
   this strain, with a concentrated inoculum (7 x 10(6)/ml), survival was
   quite the same, with or without a previous stay in raw sewage. An
   adaptation of E. coli while in wastewater to subsequent seawater stress
   seemed less obvious (Fig. 5). While monitoring the behavior of enteric
   bacteria in seawater with different previous conditions, we assessed the
   ratio of culturable cells in the total population. Thus, loss of
   culturability of tested strains was smaller when bacteria had been put
   in wastewaters before seawater (Table 1). This could show that the level
   of cellular metabolism maintained was higher in this case. This
   hypothesis was confirmed by studying the enzymatic activity of S.
   typhimurium before and after 6 days in seawater (Fig. 6). A previous
   stay in sewage could preserve or even induce some enzymatic activity
   which was then maintained during the entire exposition to seawater. This
   suggests an active metabolism enabling new protein synthesis. In this
   study, we showed that Enterobacteriaceae could adapt to seawater stress
   during their stay in sewage and sewage treatment plants. The actual
   mechanism is not yet clear. It could be osmoprotection, modification of
   cellular metabolism, or another. Very few studies have dealt with this
   topic. Munro et al. (1987, 1989) observed that a previous culture in a
   saline medium or on a mixed wastewater/seawater agar could allow better
   E. coli survival in seawater. The osmoregulation mechanisms induced by
   high osmolarity are probably set up during this phase. This hypothesis
   cannot explain our results, since the wastewaters we used had very low
   osmolarity. It seems that adaptation to drastic conditions occurs during
   the stay in wastewater (lower temperature, lack of easily assimilated
   substrates, etc.) allowing fdr better survival in more drastic seawater
   conditions. This conclusion may be of great importance in assessing the
   sanitary quality of coastal areas used for bathing and shellfishing
   activities.}},

Abstract = {{Results of a 20 months pilot plant study of microbial regrowth after the
   action on humic water of three oxidative disinfection processes
   (chlorination, u.v. irradiation and ozonation) are reported. Regrowth
   was detected as biofilm produced in 2.6 m lengths of PEH pipes. No
   biofilm was formed from the chlorinated water containing a residual of
   0.04-0.05 mg/l free chlorine. The greatest production was found from the
   ozonated water, closely followed by the control (microstrained) water.
   The u.v. irradiated water showed considerably less production of
   biofilm. This may be the effect of a residual disinfectant, the presence
   of which was also demonstrated by reduced biological oxygen demand
   compared to the control. A higher oxygen demand in ozonated water
   indicated an increase in the content of easily degradable organic
   molecules, which was confirmed by high performance size exclusion
   chromatography. The chromatograms showed a rise in low molecular
   fractions in the ozonated but not the u.v. irradiated water. Examination
   by a scanning electron microscope of biofilm on pieces of mica inserted
   in the pipe systems, revealed a higher content and variety of bacteria
   in the ozonated than in the control system, indicating a lower microbial
   activity in the latter, which also showed the highest content of
   inorganic material. The rate of biofilm formation was closely related to
   the seasonal fluctuations in water temperature. The bactericidal effect
   of the u.v. irradiated water was less pronounced during the last part of
   the experimental period. The residual free chlorine in the chlorinated
   water was, however, sufficient to prevent biofilm formation during the
   whole experimental period.}},

   mechanism. The results implied that the quantity as well as the quality

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between the
   ciliate populations density and effluent quality in activated sludge
   plants. A total of 231 samples taken at three activated sludge plants
   were analyzed over a three year period. Seven physico-chemical
   parameters were examined and protozoa (in particular ciliate protozoa)
   and small metazoa were counted by means of optical microscopy. Effluent
   quality was determined from BOD, and suspended solids concentration.
   For data analysis the species were classified in ranges in terms of
   abundance. Mean and standard deviation of effluents BOD, and SS were
   calculated for each range. It was found that as the abundance of each
   species population increased, both BOD, and suspended solids from
   effluents tended to a particular range of values (the optimal range)
   whereas the standard deviation diminished. Thus the higher the ciliate
   species population density, the better the capability of the species as
   an indicator, which is something reflected in the standard deviation.
   This capability of ciliated protozoa to act as indicators of effluent
   quality will also be limited by the other factors influencing the
   presence of species. It was observed that the correlation coefficients
   between ciliates and effluent quality depend on the range of
   physico-chemical values studied, i.e. whether they are superior or
   inferior to the `'optimal range''. The values of each species' BOD,
   optimal range varied from 4 mg/l to 18 ppm, suggesting that ciliates are
   good indicators between 4 and 18 ppm in activated sludge plants.
   In all cases observed, less common species such as Acineta tuberosa,

Abstract = {{After allowing for changes in point source phosphorus (P) loadings from
   sewage treatment works (STWs) and creameries, an upward trend in the
   soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) loadings in the six major rivers
   draining into Lough Neagh was established over the period 1974-1991.
   Urban SRP loadings were reduced by a P reduction programme at nine major
   STWs, which commenced in 1981, while the loading from other STWs was
   considered to have been stable as population growth was balanced by
   reduced P per capita loadings reflecting reductions in the P content of
   domestic detergents. Post 1987, creamery loadings were reduced following
   closures and a switch away from phosphoric acid as a cleaning agent.
   STWs were subjected to P reduction in four river catchments but
   reductions in SRP loads of these rivers were only comparable to the
   reduction in STWs loadings of SRP for a period of up to four years. Of
   the two remaining rivers, one experienced no major change in point
   source P loadings from 1974 to 1991, over which time a steady increase
   in SRP loadings occurred, while a similar SRP loading increase was also
   detected in the remaining river over a 12 year period when point sources
   were quite constant. In all river catchments, long-term changes in
   loadings or the short-term response to point source reductions could
   only be made after taking into account the variation in river SRP loads
   due to annual flow variations. The rates at which SRP loadings were
   increasing was in the range 1.30 to 1.45 kg P km(-2)yr(-1).}},

Abstract = {{A novel application of gaseous sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer, in the
   evaluation of bulk water flow through an artificial geothermal
   reservoir, the Hot Dry Rock (HDR) reservoir at Rosemanowes quarry, south
   west England, is described. The potential advantages of SF6 as a tracer,
   acid details of its deployment and analysis are outlined. In a 52 h
   continuous borehole pumping test in the HDR reservoir, SF6 and sodium
   fluorescein (NaFl) were injected simultaneously in a mass ratio of 7.5 x
   10(-7) SF6:NaFl and analysed in production well waters. Resultant tracer
   response curves demonstrate conservation of the injected tracer mass
   ratio throughout the first 25 h of the test. However, substantial
   divergence of the curves beyond 25 h reflects significant tracer
   fractionation, most probably a consequence of selective diffusion and
   enhanced SF6 residence times in some of the longer residence time flow
   paths of the system. These preliminary results clearly indicate the
   strong potential of SF6 as a water tracer in this, and in related
   groundwater applications.}},

   filters for potable water treatment is presented. The method allows the
   selection of the key design parameters (support media and filter
   dimensions) based on appropriate design curves. In the sequel, the
   possible advantages of water recirculation are examined theoretically
   and experimentally. Both theoretical and experimental results shown that
   an increase in ammonia bioconversion is expected for high or
   intermediate values of hydraulic loading and high values of inlet
   ammonia concentration, whereas at low hydraulic rates, recirculation has
   an adverse effect.}},

Abstract = {{Lead precipitation tests from aqueous solutions containing 10 mg l(-1)
   Pb and 10(-2) M sulphate were performed in the pH range 3.9-11.3, at
   inorganic carbon concentrations from background levels (approximate to 3
   x 10(-5) M) to 1.5 x 10(-2) M. Filterable lead and inorganic carbon
   concentrations, pH, and X-ray diffraction of the precipitate were
   measured during long-term ageing of precipitate suspensions in sealed
   bottles. Even though CO2 exchange with the atmosphere could not be
   completely prevented in the experimental procedure used, quasi
   equilibrium conditions between soluble and solid phases were achieved a
   few hours or days after reagents blending. Residual filterable lead
   concentrations greater than or equal to 0.1 mg l(-1) were obtained in
   the aged precipitate suspensions. A satisfactory agreement between
   solubility predictions by the equilibrium speciation model MINTEQA2 and
   filterable lead concentrations measured in aged samples may be obtained
   only with a critical selection of the solid phases considered in the
   speciation model. X-ray diffraction analysis showed the formation of
   three different solids: anglesite (PbSO4(s)), cerussite (PbCO3(s)), and
   hydrocerussite (Pb-3(CO3)(2)(OH)(2(s))). Other solid phases, even though
   stable from a thermodynamic point of view, seem to be hindered by
   kinetic limitations from precipitating at room temperature, and are not
   appropriate solid phases in modelling lead precipitation from aqueous
   solutions. The results of this work may be useful in predicting maximum
   achievable efficiencies in the neutralization/precipitation treatment of
   lead-bearing wastewaters.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, preliminary investigations into the possible use of
   Moringa oleifera seed suspension for the softening of hardwater are
   presented. Four water sources: synthetic water (distilled water spiked
   with calcium chloride), naturally hard surface water and groundwater
   from two tube wells at different locations were used for the study.
   Modified laboratory jar test procedures for coagulation studies were
   used for the experimental runs. Water hardness from the sources varied
   from 300 up to 1000 mg/l as CaCO3. The mechanism for softening was found
   to be due to adsorption with the adsorption isotherm approximating to
   the Langmuir type, and conversion of soluble hardness-causing ions to
   insoluble products by precipitation reactions. Removal efficiency was
   found to increase with increasing dosage of Moringa oliefera. Higher
   dosages were required to achieve equivalent residual hardness for water
   samples with the same initial hardness but higher number of
   hardness-causing species in the water. Hardness removal was found to be
   independent of pH of the raw water.}},

Abstract = {{Three coliphages (FRNA, FDNA and somatic) and three bacterial indicators

   four waste-treatment lagoons over 10 months. Two of the lagoons treated
   domestic sewage; the third, meat processing waste and the fourth, meat
   processing waste with a minor sewage component. In the meat processing
   lagoons the ratios of FRNA:FDNA were numerically large, due to very low
   counts of FDNA, and somatic coliphages generally outnumbered FRNA. Many
   of the FDNA plaques from meat processing lagoons were very small and
   were not confirmed on the F-plus strain, E. coli C 3000. In sewage
   lagoons all three coliphages were consistently present and FRNA usually
   outnumbered both FDNA and somatic coliphages. However, the ratios of
   FRNA to the other two coliphages were not numerically large. Ratios of
   coliphages, especially of FRNA:FDNA, seem a promising tool to
   distinguish between human and animal faecal pollution. Overall, there
   were no strong correlations between the bacterial indicators and the
   coliphages.}},

   coefficients for CH4 and CO2 were 92.6\% and 76.9\%, respectively. The
   lowest liquid temperature at which the AWSP served as a primary
   sedimentation basin without any biological degradation, was found to be
   11.7 degrees C, with a total COD removal of 30\%. First-order COD
   removal rate constant and temperature correction factor were 0.221

   28.68 and 83.17 l m(-2) day(-1). Average volumetric biogas production
   rate was 19.57 l m(-3) day(-1). Biogas volume changed during the day and

Abstract = {{The Zarka, a shallow, relatively small river flowing through a semi-arid
   region of Jordan is the country's main water course. Its prime source is
   discharge from a large overloaded waste treatment plant centred on
   stabilization ponds. Between May 1990 and January 1992, NH4-N
   concentrations of up to 130 mg/l were recorded at the river source, and
   an average 76 mg/l NO3-N at the discharge into a strategically vital
   supply reservoir. Proposed revisions to the structure of a model to
   simulate nitrification, take into account the influence of very high
   algal and bacterial populations (10(6)-10(7) cfu/ml), as their
   activities are both important factors. With respect to algae, high solar
   radiation intensities appeared to inhibit activity, such that for
   modelling, activity was related to the maximum/minimum diurnal DO ratio,
   rather than measured biomass or chlorophyll a.}},

Abstract = {{Several correlations were evaluated for predicting the gas hold-up and
   oxygen mass transfer coefficient in bubble columns. A recent hold-up
   correlation was greatly superior to the others used in this study. Only
   one of the mass transfer coefficient correlations included the effect of
   the sparger area in relationship to the total surface area, yet it was
   found that this relationship did have a significant effect on the
   measured mass transfer coefficients. Most of the mass-transfer
   correlations therefore required a correction factor. As with gas hold-up
   it was a recent correlation, based in part on theoretical principles,
   that gave the best results. This study also developed a new correlation
   for the depression to be expected from detergents on the mass transfer
   coefficient.}},

Abstract = {{A new method, utilizing radiolabeled (H-3-leucine) cells and 1-cm
   columns packed with 40-mu m borosilicate glass beads was used to
   estimate bacterial collision efficiency by directly measuring the
   retention of cells in porous media. At a fractional retention of 0.051
   (n = 3), the coefficient of variation was 0.037, permitting meaningful
   estimation of collision efficiencies as low as 3 x 10(-5). Collision
   efficiency was a function of the ionic strength and species identity;
   alpha increased from 1.6 x 10(-3) to 1.4 x 10(-2) for A. paradoxus in
   10(-5) and 10(-3) M NaCl solutions, respectively, and from 8.9 x 10(-3)
   to 6.2 x 10(-2) for P. fluorescens in the same solutions. Results were
   not sensitive to test parameters such as velocity, volume filtered and
   rinse volume. The new procedure provides a convenient, reliable,
   accurate method for estimating low-end biocolloid collision efficiencies
   in porous media. In the range alpha < 0.01, the method is economical,
   significantly faster, and much more reliable than other published
   procedures. Its application may accelerate efforts to establish
   functional relationships between biocolloid collision efficiency and
   governing physical-chemical variables.}},

Abstract = {{Hypersaline wastes are generated during industrial activities that
   include chemical manufacturing, oil and gas production and waste
   minimization practices. These wastes which contain organic compounds and
   high concentrations of salt (> 3.5\%), are difficult to treat using
   conventional microorganisms typically found in wastewater facilities.
   Biological treatment to remove organics without dilution will require
   the use of halophilic organisms which have special adaptations for
   survival at high salinities. In this paper, studies were conducted with
   a moderate halophile isolated from the Great Salt Lake, Utah, U.S.A. The
   organism was able to degrade phenol in a simulated oil field produced
   water containing 15\% salt if iron, nitrogen and phosphorus were added
   to the medium. This organism was used to develop a halophilic sludge in
   a Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) operated at 15\% salt during a 7 month
   study period. An average phenol removal of over 99.5\% was achieved with
   this reactor and specific substrate removal rates were similar to those
   reported for more conventional treatment cultures.}},

Abstract = {{Testing the toxicity of contaminated sediments is crucial to evaluating
   environmental risks because hydrophobic chemicals readily sorb to
   particulate matter. The 96-h median lethal concentration (96-h LC(50))
   for creosote-contaminated sediments was determined with spot (Leiostomus
   xanthurus), a saltwater fish common to estuarine areas of the eastern
   United States. Fish were exposed to suspended sediment in a flow-through
   system. A continuous-flow serial diluter was used to produce five
   concentrations of creosote. Sediment without creosote added was used to
   maintain a constant sediment concentration throughout the dilution
   process and for a vehicle control. The nominal concentration of
   suspended sediment in all treatments was 20 mg/l, on a dry-weight basis.
   Mean total resolvable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
   concentrations tested were 110, 250, 560, 1400, and 3300 mu g PAH/l.
   Sediment concentration varied <24\% and PAH concentration varied <36\%.
   The 96-h LC(50) was 1740 mu g PAH/l (95\% confidence interval =
   1480-2060 mu g PAH/l). This result compares favorably with results from
   tests using other species of fish and exposure methods. Other reported
   methods, however, have not demonstrated the constancy or ease of dosage
   administration for a range of concentrations as the system used here.
   Exposing fish to suspended sediments contaminated with hydrophobic
   compounds may be an appropriate method for assessing the environmental
   risk of hydrophobic chemicals to fish.}},

Abstract = {{An aerobic wastewater treatment pilot plant with cross-flow filtration
   was operated for more than 300 days to examine whether reduced sludge
   production and stable treatment performance can be achieved when sludge
   is completely retained. The volumetric loads ranged between 0.9 and 2.0
   g COD . l(-1). day(-1). Technical observations were: the oxygen transfer
   rate became poor at high sludge concentrations; membrane capacities
   declined but could be mostly sufficiently restored by cleaning. Sludge
   was hardly produced when the mixed liquor suspended solid (MLSS)
   concentration had increased to 40-50 g . l(-1). Then, the sludge load
   was only 0.021 g COD . g MLSS(-1). day(-1) and only 6\% of the carbon
   supplied was assimilated. Non-volatile compounds hardly accumulated as
   the fraction of inorganic compounds in sludge increased from 21.6 to
   23.5\% during the last 200 days, whereas the carbon, phosphor and
   kjeldahl nitrogen contents were stable. After 300 days the content of
   polluting trace elements, such as mercury, lead and cadmium, were
   similar to that of a conventional treatment plant supplied with this
   wastewater. Carbon and kjeldahl nitrogen removal was always quite
   satisfactory. Carbon was always removed for more than 90\% and kjeldahl
   nitrogen that was not assimilated was completely nitrified at all times.
   The nitrification capacity at 30 degrees C was constantly around 0.2
   mmol . g MLSS(-1). h(-1), which shows that the viability of the
   nitrifying population did not cease. In addition, up to 40\% of nitrogen
   supplied was lost as a result of denitrification. Hence stable treatment
   performance and a very low sludge production can be achieved when
   complete sludge retention is applied at high hydraulic loads.}},

Abstract = {{A new method was developed to determine the maximal nitrification
   capacity of sewage sludge. Samples of sludge were taken from two
   domestic waste water treatment plants and were chemolithotrophically
   grown in recycling reactors. The experimental duration was typically in
   the order of hours. The maximal nitrification rates were estimated from
   the concentrations of nitrogen compounds in effluents. These rates could
   be easily determined by first order kinetics, since substrates were
   supplied in excess and growth was generally negligible. However,
   accumulation of nitrite affected the ammonia oxidation rates. At 3-5 mM
   nitrite these rates were halved as compared to 0-1 mM. Since the
   accumulated nitrite is continuously diluted without loss of sludge,
   recycling reactors are especially suitable to study nitrification.
   Subsequently, this method was applied to investigate the development of
   the maximal nitrification capacity as a function of the nitrogen load.
   For this purpose, sludge was subcultured with synthetic waste water in
   recycling reactors. Since heterotrophic ammonium assimilation was
   negligible, the final capacities were proportional to the nitrogen load.
   However, these capacities were lower than expected. Since the numbers of
   protozoa had increased, predation might have reduced the nitrifying
   population.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) in a model swimming pool using
   hypobromous and hypochlorous acids as disinfectants has been studied.
   Factorial design was used to generate and process data from
   systematically-conducted experiments on a series of 11 samples of
   swimming pool simulant. The variables considered were organic loading
   (urine and humic acid concentration), disinfectant type and
   concentration, incubation time and degree of agitation. A disinfectant
   concentration of 6 mg l(-1) was used throughout. The variables affecting
   bromoform formation were urine and humic acid concentration and
   disinfectant type. Interactions were observed between humic acid and
   urine and also between urine and disinfectant. The effect of urine was
   to suppress bromoform formation. Levels of chlorine-containing THMs were
   unaffected by humic acid at the concentrations used; only the urine
   concentration and disinfectant type had a significant effect on these
   THMs. No interactions between any three or more variables were observed
   for any THM.}},

Abstract = {{We examined ground waters (from wells) which feed the distribution
   systems of some municipalities in the provinces of Parma and Reggio
   Emilia (Italy), before and after treatment with hypochlorite and
   chlorine dioxide. During our tests, THMs, TOX, free and combined
   chlorine, chlorine dioxide and chlorite were measured according to the
   American Standard Methods. These parameters were also measured in the
   waters of wells treated with known concentrations of hypochlorite and
   chlorine dioxide under the same experimental conditions in our labs.
   Before treatment THMs were always absent, while very low levels of TOX
   were always measured. THMs were not constantly present in treated
   waters: 54\% in waters treated with hypochlorite, 4\% after treatment
   with chlorine dioxide. Mean concentrations of THMs were 0.34 mu g/l with
   hypochlorite and 0.073 mu g/l with dioxide. TOX showed a fourfold
   increase with hypochlorite, from 5.9 to 22.7 mu g/l and a twofold
   increase with dioxide, from 6.8 to 14.5 mu g/l. Experimental tests
   conducted under controlled conditions confirmed this trend. TOX
   measurement, together with THMs measurement, seems to be a useful
   parameter for a more complete assessment of water quality of ground
   waters and for a more complete control of water disinfection processes.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{767-779}},

Abstract = {{Results are presented describing the influx of soluble reactive
   phosphorus (SRP) to a stream sediment in an outdoor experimental
   channel, a laboratory channel and in well-mixed suspensions. The
   kinetics of phosphorus uptake are modelled using several kinetic
   equations including the Elovich, Bangham, diffusion and first-order
   equation. The Elovich equation is found to describe best the SRP influx
   to both bed and suspended sediments. The relative contribution of
   abiotic and biotic processes in the outdoor experimental channel are
   considered together with estimates of the flux to the bed-sediment
   predicted from the results describing the kinetics in the laboratory
   channel. The sediment is characterized by mineralogy, size fractionation
   and wet-chemical analyses including total phosphorus, iron and calcium
   determinations as well as biologically available phosphorus (BAP) by the
   iron-oxide stripping method and the equilibrium phosphate concentration,
   EPC(0), calculated from sorption measurements. The kinetic results from
   this sediment illustrate the importance of suspended sediment in the
   fast uptake of SRP. This contrasts with the control of the influx of SRP
   to the bed-sediment in channels with low concentrations of suspended
   solids, caused by the rate-limiting diffusional transfer across the
   sediment-water interface.}},

Abstract = {{The method described represents an alternative to the H-3 thymidine
   incorporation technique in the determination of bacterial growth rates
   within biofilms. The effect of increasing incubation duration was
   investigated, and incorporation rates found to approximate towards
   linearity for ca Ih. Isotope dilution analyses were carried out in an
   attempt to measure dilution of added P-32 by phosphate that was being
   cycled internally within the biofilm. Statistically significant
   differences (P < 0.001) were found in rates of phospholipid synthesis in
   biofilms from the River Conwy during different seasons. A close
   correlation was found in a comparison of H-3 thymidine incorporation and
   P-32 incorporation techniques (r = 0.82; P < 0.001) in data collected
   from the rivers Conwy, Clywedog and Aber in North Wales. That close
   correlation suggested that the isotope dilution analysis technique was
   successful in overcoming potential problems caused by the pool of
   internally cycled phosphate. The alterantive H-3 thymidine incorporation
   approach cannot be used with sulphate reducing bacteria. And so finally,
   it was proposed that the P-32 incorporation technique could prove of
   value in measurements of the growth of sulphate reducing bacteria in
   biofilms causing metal corrosion.}},

Abstract = {{Equilibrium dialysis and ion exchange methods, as well as computer
   calculations (GEOCHEM), were applied for speciation of dissolved cadmium
   (Cd) in test solutions and leachate samples. The leachate samples
   originated from soil, compost, landfill waste and industrial waste. The
   ion exchange (IE) method separates dissolved Cd into free divalent Cd
   (Cd2+) and complexed Cd and furthermore separates the latter into the
   operationally defined forms: labile, slowly labile and stable complexes.
   The dialysis (ED) method determines high molecular weight Cd complexes
   (above 1000 mol. wt). For both methods the reproducibility was good. By
   combining the results of the GEOCHEM calculations in terms of the
   inorganic complexes, and the IE results, the fractions of free and
   inorganically complexed Cd were estimated. The IE and ED results
   furthermore provided information about the organic complexes. Selected
   environmental leachates showed different Cd speciation patterns as
   expected. Some leachates were dominated by free divalent Cd (1-70\%),
   some by inorganic complexes (1-87\%), and some by organic complexes
   (7-98\%).}},

Abstract = {{Reaction of free chlorine with organic compounds in water during
   drinking water treatment may lead to the formation of potentially
   carcinogenic compounds known as trihalomethanes (THMs). Monochloramine
   and metals have been investigated as alternative disinfectants. However,
   the action of either disinfectant alone requires greater concentrations
   and longer contact times compared to free chlorine. This experiment
   evaluated the efficacy of combining monochloramine (1-2.5 mg/l) and
   copper in the form of cupric chloride (0.1-0.8 mg/l) to determine if
   inactivation of MS-2 coliphage and Escherichia coli was synergistic and
   thereby decreasing the concentration and contact time for adequate
   inactivation of these organisms. Combination of 5 mg/l monochloramine
   and 0.1-0.4 mg/l cupric chloride was sufficient to produce a 3 log(10)
   inactivation of MS-2 coliphage after 10 min. Nearly 120 min was required
   for the same log(10) inactivation of MS-2 using 5 mg/l monochloramine
   alone and less than a 0.5 log(10) reduction was observed after 120 min
   using 0.4 mg/l cupric chloride alone. A 6 log(10) reduction of E. coli
   was observed after 10- and 20-min exposures to 2.5 mg/l monochloramine
   and 0.8 or 0.4 mg/l cupric chloride, respectively. To achieve the same
   inactivation of E. coli using monochloramine alone, a concentration and
   contact time of 5 mg/l for 60 min was required. No inactivation of E.
   coli was observed after exposure to 0.4 or 0.8 mg/l cupric chloride
   after 60 min. Synergism was demonstrated in the inactivation of both
   organisms using the combined chloramine copper system.}},

Abstract = {{Two bacterial strains (SL1: Rhodococcus rhodochrous, WT1: Acinetobacter
   junii) capable of biodegrading atrazine and simazine in surface water
   (1-10 mu g l(-1)) were inoculated into fixed beds of granular activated
   carbon (GAG, 20 min empty bed contact time, EBCT). fluted SL1, WT1 and
   indigenous bacteria were enumerated by spread plate on nutrient agar.
   Bacteria attached to GAC were desorbed in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5,
   recovery 75 +/- 5\%) before enumeration. Atrazine and simazine in
   treated water and adsorbed to GAC were extracted and determined by GC
   (detection limit 0.003 mu g l(-1)). 48 h after inoculation with 9.8 x
   10(8) SL1 or 1.3 x 10(9) WT1, 10\% of the SL1 (1 +/- 0.04 x 10(7) g(-1)
   dry wt GAG) and 0.77\% of the WT1 (1 +/- 0.04 x 10(6) g(-1) dry wt of
   GAG) remained in the fixed beds. No WT1 were detected in the treated
   water over a 28 day operating period although they were present on the
   GAC (2.8 +/- 0.22 x 10(4) g(-1) dry wt). An influent concentration of 2
   mg l(-1) atrazine and 2 mg l(-1) simazine (in dH(2)O) was used to induce
   breakthrough exceeding 0.003 mu g l(-1) of s-triazines in treated water,
   and the effluent concentration of inoculated and non-inoculated columns
   was compared over 40d (27 min EBCT). Up to day 18, WT1 reduced
   s-triazine concentration (maximum 0.15 +/- 0.061 mu g l(-1) atrazine,
   1.1 +/- 0.08 mu g l(-1) simazine) in treated water compared to a
   non-inoculated column (maximum 0.49 +/- 0.061 mu g l(-1) atrazine, 2.1
   +/- 0.08 mu g l(-1) simazine). After day 18 indigenous bacteria had
   acclimated to biodegrade the s-triazines and effluent concentrations
   were the same for both treatments. Total biodegradation of adsorbed
   s-triazine (87 mg atrazine and 87 mg simazine per fixed bed) ranged from
   19.5 to 32\% of each herbicide for both inoculated and non-inoculated
   GAG. Influent containing 10 mu g l(-1) atrazine and 10 mu g l(-1)
   simazine did not cause s-triazine breakthrough in treated water (< 0.003
   mu g l(-1)) over 20 days (40 min EBCT). Biodegradation of adsorbed
   atrazine and simazine (13.9 mu g g(-1) GAC for each s-triazine) by
   isolate SL1 (2 x 10(7) cells g(-1) dry wt) was 53 +/- 12.2\% atrazine
   and 58 +/- 8.2\% simazine and was significantly greater than that of
   non-sterile, non-inoculated GAC (6 x 10(6) indigenous bacteria g(-1) dry
   wt; 0\% atrazine, 32 +/- 8.2\% simazine). Inoculation of GAC packed beds
   with s-triazine degraders g reduced the amount of s-triazine adsorbed
   and treated water concentration within 40 days of inoculation and may
   extend bed life of GAC for surface water treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Annual and seasonal trends in soluble nitrogen and phosphorus
   concentrations in the River Ythan were examined using routine monitoring
   data collected between 1980 and 1992. NO3-N concentrations increased
   significantly over the 13 year period, with the greatest seasonal
   increase evidence in the spring (P < 0.001). Although this trend
   coincided with changes in cropping practice within the catchment,
   problems associated with assessing trends and causal relationships over
   relatively short time scales have been highlighted. PO4-P concentrations
   were highly variable and showed no significant trend. Output from a
   sewage treatment works at Ellon, serving a population of 8670, resulted
   in an increase in PO4-P concentration to more than double that upstream,
   the impact on NO3-N concentration was negligible. Total mean annual loss
   of NO3-N and PO4-P from the catchment was 1305 tonnes and Is tonnes,
   equivalent to losses of 19 kg N/ha and 0.26 kg P/ha respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A series of field experiments are reported which have provided empirical
   evidence to improve the understanding of faecal coliform entrainment
   mechanisms within stream channels. A new conceptual model of faecal
   coliform dynamics is proposed and preliminary modelling results
   presented. The model is based on the assumption that the entrainment and
   deposition of organisms from storage within the stream bed is governed
   by the relationship between flow and the channel bed. The organisms are
   assumed to be associated with particulates of low settling velocity.
   Channel bed storage is modelled by a series of longitudinal sub-store
   units which are sequentially accessed as flow rises, each store unit is
   rapidly depleted of organisms after the onset of entrainment. Deposition
   to sub-stores where entrainment is not occurring is assumed to occur at
   a constant rate. Further investigations are required to confirm the
   results and examine the application of the model to natural flow events
   or alternative determinands.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of the sulfate concentration and biofilm scraping on the
   treatment performance and biofilm structure of aerobic fixed film
   reactors was studied in rotating tubular reactors (RTRs). The RTRs
   operated at 22(+/-3)degrees C treating diluted milk powder (0.9 g COD/1;
   COD/SO42- ratio of 20) at an organic loading rate of 30 g COD per m(2)
   carrier material per day. The reference RTR gave the following removal
   efficiencies: CODtot, 76\%; CODsol, 91\%; N-tot-N, 51\%; N-org-N, 70\%;
   PO43--P, 45\%. COD removal was linear as a function of the reactor
   length (2 mg COD/cm reactor). The biomass yield coefficient amounted to
   0.44(+/-0.13)g DM/g COD removed. High sulfate concentrations appreciably
   reduced the yield to 0.28(+/-0.06)g DM/g CODrem but did not
   significantly influence the COD and nutrient removal capacity, despite
   the longer hydraulic retention time (12'07'')compared to the reference
   RTR (6'25''). Daily removal of about 15\% of the biofilm by biomass
   scraping did not significantly affect the reactor performance. Biofilm
   samples growing in the reference and the sulfate amended reactor showed
   comparable specific oxygen uptake rates (15 mg O-2,/g VS.h). In the
   reactor treating sulfate-rich wastewater, large populations (6.3-7.5 log
   CFU/g VS) of lactate, acetate, propionate and butyrate oxidizing sulfate
   reducing bacteria (SRB) were present. Their number as well as their
   sulfate reducing activity (13.5 +/- 9.5 mg SO42-S/g VS.h) was higher
   compared to the reference RTR. The addition of molybdate (30 mM) to the
   influent showed that SRB could account for 50\% and 10\% of the COD
   removal in the sulfate amended and reference RTR, respectively. It is
   concluded that wastewaters with a low COD/SO42- ratio are particularly
   suited for aerobic fixed film processes because of the low waste biomass
   production.}},

Abstract = {{A selection of aerobic biofilm reactors and activated sludge plants were
   investigated for the presence of methane producing bacteria (MPB) and
   sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). Detection tests showed that
   acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic MPB as well as lactate, acetate and
   propionate oxidizing SRB were present in all reactor types investigated,
   except in an activated sludge reactor aerated with pure oxygen. Methane
   production rates from acetate by biomass samples of aerobic reactors
   were less than 1\% of the rates measured in anaerobic UASB sludge. The
   presence of SRB was independent of the reactor configuration, the
   organic loading and the influent sulfate concentration. Aerobic biofilms
   growing in a trickling filter packed with plastic carrier and in a
   rotating biological contactor contained between 5.7 x 10(7) to 1.1 x
   10(8) CFU/g VS of lactate oxidizing SRB and showed a potential sulfate
   reduction rate using lactate as electron donor of about 10 mg SO42-/g
   VS.h. The latter is comparable to the values found in sludges from
   typical anaerobic wastewater treatment reactors. In activated sludges,
   SRB densities were some 10(3) time lower and the maximum sulfate
   reduction rate was ca 3 times lower compared to the aerobic biofilm
   reactors. In biofilms, high sulfate reduction rates, in combination with
   the high sulfide removal rates (11.6 to 131.7 mg HS-/g VS.h) suggest
   that in situ reoxidation of sulfide might sustain the SRB population.
   The SRB enumeration, together with activity and oxygen microprofile
   measurements showed that the biomass of aerobic wastewater treatment
   systems can serve as inoculum or as site for a wide spectrum of redox
   related biotransformation processes.}},

   measuring transient concentrations during the alternating mode of
   operation in the aerobic and anoxic tanks. The data were normalized to
   standard conditions by correcting them according to the kinetic theory.
   The average normalized nitrification rate was measured to be between 54

Abstract = {{To evaluate the effect of methanol concentration and inorganic carbon on
   the competition between acetogens and methanogens for methanol, eight
   upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors were operated continuously with
   different levels of sodium bicarbonate at variable methanol loadings.
   The results indicated that methylotrophic methanogens will predominate
   in a broad pH range (4.2-7.2) if either the methanol concentration in
   the effluent or inorganic carbon is low. Continuous steady state methane
   production resulted in chemical oxygen demand (GOD) removals of
   99.8-54\% at organic loadings ranging from 7.6 to 22g COD.1(-1).d(-1).
   On the other hand, significant acetogenesis occurred if exogenous
   inorganic carbon was supplied and if the methanol concentration in the
   effluent was greater than 1000 mg COD.1(-1). The observation that
   acetogenesis only occurred in the presence of high methanol
   concentrations in the effluent confirms the previously determined
   60-times-higher substrate affinity of methanogens. Steady state
   acetogenesis was only observed when unionized VFA, which inhibited the
   methanogens, were present at high levels for prolonged periods of time.
   Addition of moderate levels of NaHCO3 (15 meq.1(-1)) were found to
   create such conditions since VFA accumulation exceeded the buffering
   capacity. Continuous acetogenesis from methanol at organic loading rates
   of 21 g COD.1(-1).d(-1) resulted in poor COD removal (16.3\%). In
   contrast, high levels of NaHCO, supplementation (greater than or equal
   to 25 meq.1(-1)) favoured methane production since the alkalinity was
   strong enough to prevent toxic levels of undissociated acids even in
   periods when VFA accumulated as a result of organic overloading.}},

   used to develop a dynamic model to describe the removal of soluble
   chemical oxygen demand (SCOD). This model was applied to the other
   reactor data to test the reliability of the model, and was found to be
   appropriate. Rate constant for SCOD removal and temperature correction
   coefficient were 0.325 g SCOD g(-1) MLVSS day(-1) (for 20 degrees C) and
   1.017, respectively. The minimum hydraulic detention time in AWSP should
   be more than 4 days. For the land-scale application of an AWSP, SCOD
   loading rate must be lower than 0.15 kg SCOD m(-3) day(-1). Methane

Abstract = {{To assess the effects of magnetic water treatment under well controlled
   laboratory conditions, and to yield statistically defensible results, a
   saturated solution of CaSO4.2H(2)O was tested in the magnetic field of a
   nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. Five replicates were performed
   of each experiment. The two independent variables tested-magnetic field
   strength and rotation speed-were set at two levels, `'on'' (4.75 T and
   1200 rpm respectively) or `'off''. Parameters chosen to monitor the
   treatment effect were conductivity, soluble calcium, total suspended
   solids (TSS), and Zeta potential (zeta). Results showed that the
   magnetic treatment indeed had a significant effect on the precipitation
   of CaSO4 crystals. Conductivity, soluble Ca, and zeta potential all
   decreased, whereas TSS increased. A transfer of Ca from the soluble to
   the solid phase (crystal as CaSO4.2H(2)O) was confirmed by mass balance
   calculations. Thus the results are consistent with claims in the
   literature that magnetic water treatment can induce precipitation of
   inorganic crystals from solution, and could possibly prevent scaling by
   avoiding precipitation of these salts on to solid surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Since algal growth has been shown to play a key role in determining the
   fate of metals in lakes and marine waters, we wondered if the Rhine
   phytoplankton, so much stimulated by nutrient input, would affect the
   partitioning of metals between the dissolved and particulate phases,
   thereby altering the retention of metals in the Rhine delta. In a
   seasonal study in which variations in the partitioning of Mn, Cu, Zn, Cd
   and Pb (expressed as log K-p values) were correlated with phytoplankton
   parameters, it appeared that manganese occurred mainly In the
   particulate form during algal blooms, whereas dissolved manganese
   predominated during periods low in phytoplankton. Photosynthetic
   activity (up to 700 mu g C 1(-1) h(-1)) correlated slightly better with
   the {[}log K-p]-Mn than the chlorophyll a concentration (up to 140 mu g
   1(-1)) and the pH (up to 8.35), suggesting that phytoplankton
   photosynthesis promotes Mn precipitation in the river. The variability
   in the partitioning of Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb in 1990 did not seem to be
   determined by the seasonal differences in phytoplankton and manganese
   partitioning, although increased values of {[}log K-p]-Zn had been
   indicated for the summer of 1983, when metal concentrations had
   generally been higher than in 1990. The lack of effect of riverine
   phytoplankton blooms on partitioning of metals other than Mn contrasts
   with observations in stagnant waters. However, the low levels of
   cellular metal observed in cultures, along with the single growth pulse
   that phytoplankton shows during its short residence in the river, are
   consistent with the observations.}},

   oxidation to nitrate or of partial oxidation to nitrite may be attained,
   depending on the initial conditions. A model incorporating Monod and

   employed for parameter estimation. A steady-state solution, expressed in
   terms of the measured variables-total biomass concentration in the
   reactor and in the effluent-was derived and its parameters were
   estimated. The model was then analyzed to show domains of steady state
   multiplicity under two control strategies in which either the sludge age

Abstract = {{The purpose of this research is to compare the ability of metal removal
   between an aerobic selector activated sludge system and a conventional
   CSTR system. Metal biosorption by sludge harvested from experimental
   systems was determined by a series of batch experiments. Heavy metals
   studied in this research were zinc, cadmium and nickel. Results of
   experimental data revealed that metal biosorption by activated sludge
   was rapid; about 70\% of the soluble metals in solution was removed
   during the first 30 min. The sorption isotherm showed that at metal
   equilibrium concentrations greater than 0.05 mg/l, the selector sludge
   had significantly higher sorption capacity than did the CSTR sludge.
   Metal biosorption behavior closely followed a Freudlich isotherm model
   for equilibrium concentrations above 0.05 mg/l. Results of the
   Freundlich model suggested that the adsorption capacity of sludge from
   the aerobic selector was significantly higher than that of the CSTR
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrophenols are widely used for manufacturing explosives,
   pharmaceuticals, pesticides, pigments, dyes, etc. A literature research
   shows that there is a lack of quantitative information on the effects of
   nitrophenols on anaerobic systems. The objective of this research was to
   study the toxic effects of nitrophenols on acetate enrichment,
   methanogenic systems. Anaerobic toxicity assays were performed with
   batch serum bottles. Results showed that among the selected
   nitrophenols, toxicity decreases in the following order:
   2,4-dinitrophenol > 4-nitrophenol > 2-nitrophenol > 3-nitrophenol.
   Complete removals of mononitrophenols were seen in serum bottle systems
   which did not fail due to toxicity. Chemostats (15-day retention time)
   were used to study toxicity, acclimation, and removal of 4-nitrophenol
   in continuous systems. New steady-states with high effluent acetate
   (substrate) concentrations were attained after spiking 5.5, 13.5, and
   33.0 mg l(-1) of 4-nitrophenol. A competitive inhibition coefficient
   model fits well with the experimental data from 4-nitrophenol studies.
   The competitive inhibition coefficient K-1, for 4-nitrophenol varied
   between 0.077 and 0.089 mg l(-1). Fifty-five to 82\% of the
   4-nitrophenol was removed in the chemostats; HPLC analysis of effluents
   showed no intermediate products.}},

   replicate standard 96-h static acute toxicity tests. In EC(50)
   comparisons, crayfish from the contaminated Wavy Lake were significantly
   more tolerant to all Cu concentrations during 24-h exposures than were
   those from Pike Creek; no significant differences (P > 0.05) in the
   response between the two populations were observed with increases in
   exposure periods beyond 24 h. In LC(50) comparisons, Pike Creek crayfish
   had a significantly lower mortality rate in 48-h exposure than did
   decapods from Wavy Lake; no significant differences (P > 0.05) in the
   response between the two populations were observed with increases in
   exposure periods beyond 48 h. The two populations, on the whole, did not
   show significant differences in their EC(50)-LC(50) values at various
   periods they were exposed to the toxicant. However, there were
   significant differences (P < 0.05) in Cu concentrations that caused
   behavioural impairment and mortality in animals from the two sites. In
   general, individuals from the contaminated Wavy Lake were better suited
   to resist short-term (less than or equal to 24 h) behavioural impairment
   than were crayfish from the uncontaminated Pike Creek, possibly because
   of the ability of the former to detoxify Cu at a comparatively quicker
   rate than the latter. However, once their behaviour was impaired, the
   crayfish from the contaminated lake were unable to withstand further Cu
   intake. The reason for the phenomenon may lie in the early saturation
   and subsequent failure of their copper regulatory mechanism because of
   comparatively high Cu body burdens associated with living in a
   metal-contaminated environment.}},

Abstract = {{Two rapid small-scale column tests (RSSCTs) were conducted in
   combination with a large column adsorber to determine if the small
   columns could predict the performance of a large column. The adsorbate
   solution consisted of three volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) in the
   presence of background organic matter (BOM). Landfill leachate was used
   as the BOM source. Dissolved molecular oxygen was used as a parametric
   viriable in the column studies to determine its influence on the
   breakthrough behavior of the adsorbate solution. The RSSCT, designed
   according to the assumption of no dependency of the intraparticle
   surface diffusion coefficient on the activated carbon particle size,
   accurately predicted the performance of the large column under anoxic
   conditions (absence of molecular oxygen), but failed to predict its
   performance under ambient (8 mg l(-1) dissolved oxygen) or oxic
   conditions (30 mg l(-1) dissolved oxygen). The RSSCT, designed according
   to the assumption of a linear dependency of the intraparticle surface
   diffusion coefficient on the activated carbon particle size, accurately
   predicted the performance of the large column under oxic and ambient
   conditions, but failed to predict its performance under anoxic
   conditions. The presence of molecular oxygen in the test environment
   resulted in an increased adsorption of the BOM on the GAC surface, which
   in turn, decreased the capacity of the VOCs due to competitive effects.}},

Abstract = {{The mobility of cationic trace metals, such as ph and Cd, in porous
   media can be severely limited by their adsorption at the solid/solution
   interface. The transport of metals can be enhanced by complexation with
   a ligand of `'carrier'' that (i) is soluble in water and does not
   strongly sorb to surfaces, (ii) has a high metal binding affinity and
   (iii) is not readily altered in soil by chemical or biological
   reactions. Extracellular polymers of bacterial origin are plausible
   carriers for metals in soil or aquifer systems. Bacterial extracellular
   polymers occur naturally in groundwaters and some have well established
   metal binding properties. In this study, extracellular polymers from 13
   bacterial strains, including five subsurface isolates, were screened for
   their ability to mobilize Pb and Cd adsorbed to an aquifer sand. Batch
   adsorption isotherms were employed to screen polymers for their effect
   on metal phase distribution. Air of the extracellular polymers tested
   reduced the linear distribution coeffients of Cd and Pb. Reductions in
   metal adsorption by over 90\% were achieved at an extracellular polymer
   concentration of 10.6 mg l(-1) The sorption isotherm of a selected
   extracellular polymer indicated that it had a low affinity for the sand
   sorbent and suggested that the polymer would be mobile in the porous
   sand medium. The distribution coefficient of the polymer for the sand
   was not effected by the presence Cd at low concentrations. Independently
   determined distribution constants for Cd and extracellular polymer with
   the sand and the binding constant for Cd to polymer yielded reasonable
   estimates of the observed distribution of Cd in the presence of the
   extracellular polymer. Column experiments performed with Cd in the
   presence and absence of the selected extracellular polymer confirmed
   that application of polymer solutions can enhance metal mobility in
   porous media.}},

Abstract = {{The relation between the acute toxicity and accumulation of 12
   chlorophenols in goldfish exposed to media containing the chemicals at
   Various pH, and also the transport mechanism of chlorophenols from the
   surrounding water in the fish were investigated. Both the acute toxicity
   and accumulation of chlorophenols increased with increasing number of
   substituted chlorine atoms, although the magnitude of their increase
   decreased with increasing pH. For each chlorophenol, both the toxicity
   and the amount accumulated in the surviving fish was almost unchanged in
   the range of pH < pK(a), but abruptly decreased with increasing media pH
   in the range of pH > pK(a). On the other hand, the amount found in the
   dead fish was little dependent on the pH of media. The distribution
   ratio (K) between the medium (compartment I) and fish body (compartment
   II) was calculated on the basis of the assumption that only the
   undissociated form migrates between the two compartments by diffusion
   and that the ratio of the concentration of the undissociated form in
   compartment I to that in compartment II is proportional to the partition
   coefficients in 1-octanol-water and n-heptane-water systems. A good
   correlation was observed between log bioconcentration ratio (BCR) and
   log K value calculated by using the partition coefficient in the
   1-octanol-water system. From these results, it is concluded that the
   transfer of chlorophenols from media to fish body, in which the
   formation of intermolecular hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group in
   the chemicals and the components in gill membranes plays an important
   role, is mainly caused by the passive diffusion of the undissociated
   form through the membranes, and the concentration of the chemicals in
   the fish body does not readily reach a lethal level with increasing pH
   of the medium owing to the increased conversion of the undissociated
   form to the dissociated form, resulting in the reduction of the toxicity
   of chlorophenols in the fish. However, the BCR was a little higher than
   that estimated from the concentration of the undissociated form in the
   media. The reason was presumed that the pH near the outer surface of the
   gill membranes is lower than that of the media.}},

Abstract = {{The fractal properties of aggregates formed under two different fluid
   mechanical environments a paddle mixer and a rolling cylinder, were
   measured using three different techniques: a non-steady state method
   requiring both volume and length size distributions, a steady state size
   distribution method, and an aggregate property scaling method. Based on
   cumulative size distributions and the non-steady state method,
   aggregates produced in the rolling cylinder had a fractal dimension of
   D-3(l,v) = 1.59 +/- 0.16, while aggregates produced in the paddle mixer
   had a higher fractal dimension of D-3(l,v) = 1.92 +/- 0.04. Fractal
   dimensions calculated assuming steady state size distributions based on
   aggregate volume were substantially different than those based on
   aggregate length indicating that size distributions in both devices were
   not at steady state during the experiment. Although fractal dimension
   based on cumulative size distributions were similar in magnitude to
   those calculated using discrete and data-averaged size distributions,
   the cumulative size distributions produced fractal dimensions with the
   lowest errors. When D-3 < 2, three dimensional and two dimensional
   fractal dimensions should be equal. Power law equations for two
   dimensional fractal dimensions based on aggregate properties (length and
   area) were in good agreement with three dimensional fractal dimensions.
   Rolling cylinder and paddle mixer aggregates had two dimensional fractal
   dimensions of D-2 = 1.68 +/- 0.02 and D-2 = 1.89 +/- 0.02. These
   experiments demonstrate that aggregate properties are a function of the
   fluid mechanical environment used to coagulate particles.}},

Abstract = {{The study of the survival of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium
   in sewage treated by stabilization ponds, and then mixed more or less
   rapidly with coastal marine water, has been experimentally tested in
   microcosms (membrane diffusion chambers). The results obtained show that
   under the same experiment conditions (slow saline, marine and rapid
   saline stress) the survival time of the two bacteria varies
   considerably. In sewage treated by stabilization ponds, Salmonella
   typhimurium and Escherichia coli exhibit the similar survival rates.
   T-90 evaluated for Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium in the
   winter period was, respectively, 125 and 132 h. In brackish water the
   survival rate of Salmonella typhimurium was generally higher than that
   of Escherichia coli. When these two bacteria were suspended in
   stabilization ponds effluent and rapidly mixed with brackish water,
   survival time was particularly short, whereas it was prolonged when the
   bacteria were submitted to a gradual increase in salinity. Biological
   factors, and in particular predation, can play an important role in
   eliminating enteric bacteria during pond system treatment, but their
   efficiency is supposed to diminish significantly when there is an
   environmental change such as the discharge of pond system effluent into
   brackish water. This can explain the increase of enteric bacteria
   survival.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative study of the sorption of phenol and p-chlorophenol from
   water has been performed using novel samples prepared by carbonisation
   and subsequent activation of straw and used rubber tyres as well as

   Pseudo-equilibrium sorption of phenol and p-chlorophenol obeys a
   Freundlich type adsorption isotherm of the form; q = k c(n) in the
   adsorbate concentration range 0-6 mmol l(-1). Measured values of k and n
   indicate that the sorption of phenol and p-chlorophenol onto active
   carbons derived from straw and used rubber tyres is almost identical to
   that for conventional activated carbons. The rate of adsorbate uptake
   has been measured and the sorption half-times lie in the range 1.4-15
   min for phenol. The sorption kinetics of the straw and rubber tyre based
   carbons are likewise identical to conventional carbons based on coal and
   wood but appreciably faster than the coconut shell sample selected for
   comparison.}},

Abstract = {{The exchanges at the sediment-water interface were studied in the river
   Seine, downstream from Paris. Various species of nitrogen were
   considered. A budget of exchanges could be established between the
   sewage treatment plant at Acheres and Poses, 140 km downstream. For each
   of the three sites studied the sediments were characterized by their
   granulometry and their particulate organic carbon and particulate
   nitrogen contents. To quantify the exchanges between the sediments and
   the water two techniques were used: study of cores interstitial water
   and of dialysis cells water allow to establish vertical profiles for
   nitrogen and phosphorus, essential to calculate molecular diffusion;
   global exchanges at the interface were determined with a benthic
   bell-jar, whose water was regularly sampled until anoxy is reached. That
   study allowed the clarification of the exchange kinetics at the
   sediment-water interface with regards to the sludge deposited in the
   river from the sewage treatment plant. Denitrification played a minor
   role while ammonification of organic nitrogen seemed to be partially
   responsible for the ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations in the
   interstitial water. A notable release of phosphorus was also observed.
   The concentration gradients measured in the dialysis cells experiments
   were used to calculate the exchanges exclusively due to molecular
   diffusion, while the measurements obtained with benthic bell-jars took
   into account all the chemical, biological and physical phenomena. Thus
   the discrepancies found between the values of molecular diffusion and
   the exchange values obtained with benthic bell-jars were very marked.
   These last values allowed the establishment of the mean release budgets
   in the studied area: ammoniacal nitrogen, 13.4 t d(-1); phosphorus, 3.7
   t d(-1).}},

Abstract = {{The waste slurry generated in fertilizer plants in India has been
   converted to a cheap carbonaceous adsorbent material. This product is
   found to be a promising scavenger of some toxic metal ions and phenols
   in industrial effluents. It has been successfully tried for the removal
   of a variety of substituted phenols from synthetic as well as live waste
   from oil refineries. Since a number of organic compounds may be present
   in industrial waste water, a possible competition that can take place in
   such systems, has been studied and reported in this paper. The
   competitive effect on the uptake of various substituted phenols viz
   2,4,6-trinitrophenol, 4-nitrophenol, 4-chlorophenol and
   1,3-dihydroxybenzene, on the carbonaceous adsorbent developed from
   fertilizer waste, has been studied using the Langmuir model for bisolute
   systems and also by the Jain and Snoeyink modified model.}},

Abstract = {{A kinetic study was carried out on the anaerobic digestion of Olive Mill
   Wastewater (OMW) and OMW that was previously fermented with Geolrichum
   candidum, Azotobacter chrooeoccum and Aspergillus terreus. The
   bioreactor used was batch fed and contained sepiolite as support for the
   mediating bacteria. Experimental data observed for methane production
   (G) against time (t) are described by the following equation: G =
   G(M){[}1 - exp(- AXt/S-0), over the COD range studied (3.9-14.5 g/l),
   where G(M) is the maximum methane volume obtained at the end of
   digestion time; S-0 is the initial substrate concentration; X is the
   microorganism concentration and A is the kinetic constant of the
   process, which was calculated using a nonlinear regression; This kinetic
   parameter was found to be influenced by the pretreatment carried out,
   and was 4.6, 4.1 and 2.3 times higher for Aspergillus, Azotobacter and
   Geotrichum-pretreated OMW's than that obtained in the anaerobic
   digestion of untreated OMW. The kinetic constant increased when the
   phenolic compound content and biotoxicity of the pretreated-OMW's
   decreased. Finally, the yield coefficient, T-p, was 260 (untreated OMW),
   300 (Geotrichum-pretreated OMW), 315 (Azotobacter-pretreated OMW) and
   350 (Aspergillus-pretreated OMW) ml CH4 STP/g COD.}},

Abstract = {{Four coal-based media, viz. alurn-pretreated or ferric
   hydroxide-impregnated Giridih bituminous coal and lignite (alum-GBC,
   Fe-GBC; alum-lignite and Fe-Lignite) were laboratory tested to assess
   their potential in removing/inactivating enteric viruses in water.
   Batch-sorption screening tests, employing a poliovirus-spiked (3.10 x
   10(7)-1.49 x 10(8) PFU l(-1)) canal water, indicated high poliovirus
   sorption by Fe-GBC (7.07 x 10(6) PFU g(-1)) and alum-GBC (5.70 x 10(6)
   PFU g(-1)) in a short contact time of 5 min. Based on the results of
   further batch-sorption tests, using silver-incorporated media
   (alum/Ag-GBC, alum-GBC-Ag and Fe-GBC-Ag), as well as aesthetic water
   quality consideration and previous findings on removal of coliforms and
   turbidity, alum/Ag-GBC, alum-GBC and alum-GBC-Ag were included in
   downflow column studies (bed depth 10 cm; flow rate 99 ml h(-1); bed
   flowthrough time 4.76 min), employing poliovirus-spiked (1.95 x
   10(5)-2.68 x 10(7) PFU l(-1)) canal water. All three media showed
   potential in removing/inactivating enteric viruses. In a separate column
   study (bed depth 25.4 cm; flow rate 500 ml h(-1); flowthrough time 7.7
   min), employing a joint challenge of poliovirus and rotavirus (2.47 x
   10(7) PFU l(-1)), alum/Ag-GBC removed 59.3-86.5\% of the viruses along
   with more than 99\% reduction in indigenous heterotrophic bacteria.
   Alum/silver-pretreated bituminous coal medium appears promising for use
   in household water filters in rural areas of the developing world.
   However, improved medium preparation to further enhance its efficiency
   is needed; also, its efficacy in removing/inactivating indigenous
   enteric bacteria, viruses and protozoa has to be ensured and
   practicalities or economics of application need to be considered.}},

Abstract = {{The treatment of tannery wastewater by the electrochemical method using
   Ti/Pt and, Ti/Pt/Ir electrodes is investigated. The aim of a
   satisfactory elimination of NH: from wastewaters of different strength
   was achieved using both types of electrodes. A Ti/Pt/Ir anode proved to
   have the electrocatalytical properties for NH4+ removal, but it resulted
   to be more sensitive to poisoning by H2S contained in the wastewater.
   For both types of the electrodes NH4+ removal followed pseudo-first
   order kinetics, with the rate decreasing in function of the presence of
   organic substances. A concurrent removal of COD was observed
   particularly with a Ti/Pt anode, but its magnitude was not sufficient to
   ensure the discharge limits to be met while treating the raw wastewater
   only by the electrochemical process. In conclusion the electrochemical
   process can be applied successfully as a final polishing or an
   alternative to biological nitrification, but cannot substitute
   completely the traditional treatment of tannery wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{Pilot-scale anaerobic digesters were operated on ice-cream wastewater
   for over three years. The performance of four reactor designs, an
   anaerobic filter, contact process and UASB of capacity 5 m(3), and a 0.5
   m(3) fluidised bed, was compared. The anaerobic filter, with a 3.3 m(3)
   Pall ring bed, operated stably at organic loading rates (B-v) around 6
   kg COD m(-3) d(-1), giving total COD removals around 67\%. The contact
   process gave consistently good total COD removals of 80\%, but was
   limited by the poor performance of the settling compartment. Mixed
   liquor suspended solids did not rise above 3 kg m(-3), and this reactor
   operated at B-v of 1 kg COD m(-3) d(-1). The fluidised bed reactor,
   operated on sand or granular activated carbon support media at B-v of 4
   and 2 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) respectively, gave about 60\% total COD
   removal, but difficulty was experienced with GAC break-up. The UASB
   reactor gave the poorest performance, (approximately 50\% total COD
   removal at a B-v of 2 kg COD m(-3) d(-1)) since successful granulation
   was not achieved. The anaerobic filter was also operated for 9 months
   after removing half of its packing material, but the former loading rate
   could not be achieved without instability. Poor biomass retention in all
   reactors, possibly related to the fat content of the wastewater, was the
   limiting factor in performance. Using experience gained at pilot scale,
   a full-scale upflow anaerobic filter was subsequently installed on an
   ice-cream factory site. This reactor showed similar performance to the
   pilot-scale filter.}},

Abstract = {{The biological nitrogen removal in an alternating activated sludge
   process is described and analyzed using a simplified model of the IAWQ
   activated sludge model No. 1. In face of the alternating nature of the
   process, a new analytical approach is developed by introducing the
   nitrification capacity and denitrification potential concepts into the
   alternating process analysis. This facilitates a more obvious insight
   into the nitrogen removal with the development of mathematical
   relationships between the nitrogen removal efficiency and the process
   operational conditions. The process performances with different
   operational conditions and control strategies are presented using this
   approach. The results show that the total nitrogen removal is strongly
   dependent on the process load, nitrification rate, denitrification rate,
   cycle length and DO setpoint etc. and an optimal operation requires a
   proper match between the nitrification and denitrification. In addition,
   the different control strategies are evaluated using the new analytic
   technique and through this their mechanism and effectiveness are better
   understood.}},

Abstract = {{Biomonitoring of toxicity, using the Ceriodaphnia dubia acute toxicity
   test, was performed on a gasoline-contaminated aquifer in San Diego,
   Calif. undergoing in situ bioremediation. The bioremediation approach
   here featured nitrate enrichment of extracted groundwater (with
   subsequent reinfiltration back into the aquifer) to stimulate bacterial
   denitrification. Dentrification has been shown to support biodegradation
   of the monoaromatic hydrocarbons-benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and the
   isomers of xylene (BTEX). During the period between the start of
   bioremediation (October, 1989) and the end of nutrient enrichment(March,
   1992), BTEX levels at the two most contaminated wells on site (MW1 and
   MW5) were reducted by about 81 and 99\%, respectively. In acute
   bioassays of groundwater from MW1 during the first 6 months of
   bioremediation, concentrations of groundwater from about 3 to 10\%
   produced 50\% mortality of Ceriodaphnia after 24 h exposure, whereas
   groundwater concentrations of greater than 20\% were required after
   remediation. When the 24-h LC50's for mortality were plotted as a
   function of BTEX concentration, the slope of the regression line was
   similar for both laboratory and field nitrate-enrichment studies. At
   MW5, where the BTEX level was dramatically reduced by 99\% during
   bioremediation, the 24-h LC50 after bioremediation increased to 56\%
   (from initial values of 12-15\%), while uncontaminated groundwater from
   a well up-gradient of the gasoline leak, showed an LC50 value of 74\%.
   These results demonstrate that even after bioremediation of an aquifer
   (with an associated BTEX reduction of 81-99\%), the toxicity (as
   measured by Ceriodaphnia) of the groundwaters may not be reduced to
   precontamination levels.}},

Abstract = {{Recently published data show that the adsorptive capacity of granular
   activated carbon for phenols increases significantly in the presence of
   molecular oxygen (Vidic, Suidan, Traegner and Nakhla, 1990). In this
   study, the effect of molecular oxygen on the adsorptive capacity of
   activated carbon for the natural organic matter present in Ohio River
   water was investigated. This source of natural organic matter was
   selected because it is a natural surface water and represents
   Cincinnati's main drinking water supply. Isotherm studies using
   pulverized activated carbon were conducted during the first week of each
   month of the year 1992. Adsorption isotherms were conducted on water
   from two stages of treatment (raw water directly pumped from the Ohio
   River and settled water from the California Drinking Water Treatment
   Plant, Cincinnati, Ohio). Investigations were conducted in the presence
   and absence of molecular oxygen. An appreciable increase in the
   adsorptive capacity of activated carbon for natural organic matter was
   noticed when molecular oxygen was present in the test environment. The
   adsorption isotherms were further described by fractionating the unknown
   matrix into a non adsorbable fraction and four fictive components of
   different adsorbabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Strategies for discharging pollutants into estuaries have been proposed
   in the literature. Here, a one-dimensional model is used to compare
   different strategies for discharging both conserved and decaying
   pollutants into narrow estuaries where the pollution outlet is more than
   one tidal excursion from the estuary mouth. The range of usefulness of
   the various strategies is defined. In particular it is seen that
   although the absence of a diluting Row at the turn of the tide can cause
   peaks in the pollutant concentration, sophisticated strategies designed
   to avoid these peaks are only really worthwhile in estuaries which carry
   a relatively large fresh water flow. In the more common situation of a
   very small fresh water Row these peaks become a local effect around the
   pollution outlet and the expedient of simply turning off the pollutant
   Row when the tide is turning is nearly as effective as any other method
   of eliminating concentration peaks. So far as pollution with organic
   matter is concerned, it is seen that the maximum dissolved oxygen
   deficit is usually quite insensitive to the discharge strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfide product inhibition kinetics for growth and activity of
   Desulfovibrio desulfuricans was investigated in batch and continuous
   cultures at pH = 7.0. A non-competitive inhibition model adequately
   described sulfide product inhibition kinetics. Inhibition coefficient
   (K-i) for maximum specific growth rate (mu(max)(inh)) was 251 mg l(-1) S
   in a batch experiment. Celll yield determined in a chemostate was
   reduced in half by a sulfide concentration of about 250 mg l(-1) S,
   which was very close to the K-i value for the batch growth. Maximum
   specific growth rate mu(max)(inh) and cell yield (Y-e/Lac) were strongly
   inhibited by high levels of sulfide concentrations, whereas specific
   lactate utilization rate increased with increasing sulfide
   concentrations. The results indicated an increase in the relative energy
   needed for maintenance to overcome sulfide inhibition and uncoupling
   growth from energy production. However, D. desulfuricans to some extent
   could recover from the shock of high sulfide concentrations.
   Stoichiometry for catabolic reactions (energy producing) did not change
   at high sulfide concentrations, while anabolic reactions (cellular
   synthesis) were strongly inhibited by high sulfide concentrations. These
   results suggested that separation of-sulfide product inhibition into
   growth (cell yield) and activity (substrate utilization rate) was
   important to incorporate the sulfide product inhibition kinetics in a
   variety of applications.}},

Abstract = {{In microbial consortia from rapid sand filters, manganese and nitrate
   transformations appear to be linked. Nitrate appears to have a
   beneficial effect on the removal of Mn. In aerated batch cultures
   derived from these consortia, the Mn removal rate was 38\% higher in the
   presence of nitrate and was accompanied by nitrite accumulation. There
   was no increase in Mn removal when ammonium was added to the medium
   instead of nitrate. (NO3)-N-15 experiments with batch cultures of Mn
   removing mixed bacterial cultures showed denitrification. The nitrate
   profile inside bacterial Aocs was determined by means of microelectrode
   measurements. Nitrate uptake inside Aocs grown in the presence of
   nitrate occurred under both anoxic and aerated conditions. No or a very
   slight nitrate uptake occurred in a floc poisoned with 0.2\% HgCl2 and a
   flee grown in the absence of nitrate, respectively. In microbial Aocs
   originating from two different field sites incubated under anoxic
   conditions, the presence of Mn2+ increased the nitrate-N gradient in the
   flee by 35-130\%. Nitrate also exerted a stabilizing effect on the
   removal of Mn: microbial consortia were prevented from reducing MnO2 to
   Mn2+ by the presence of nitrate}},

Abstract = {{An innovative technology using Colloidal Gas Aphrons (CGAs) is applied
   in this study to flush residual levels of a light non-aqueous phase
   liquid (LNAPL) such as automatic transmission fluid (ATF) from a
   Superfund site soil. Performance of CGA suspensions is compared with
   that of conventional aqueous anionic surfactant solutions under both
   gravity stable (downflow) and gravity unstable (upflow) conditions. CGA
   suspensions were found to be more effective in washing ATF under both
   downflow and upflow modes. The displacement of ATF from the soil pores
   seems to be the mechanism of removal in the case of water floods.
   Increasing the surfactant concentration did not increase the removal
   rate correspondingly. The pressure required to pump the CGA suspension
   was much lower than that required for conventional surfactant solutions
   or water flood. Results show enough promise that more research should be
   directed at this potential technology for in situ remediation of
   contaminated aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main causes of lack of potability in a water supply is
   eutrophication. This is caused by the natural or anthropogenic
   contributions of nitrogen and phosphorus. The dumping of domestic
   sewage, Leaching from urban waste dumps, farm purine and even habitual
   agricultural and forestry practices contribute these elements to water.
   Whatever the use of a territory, it involves a greater or lesser degree
   of movement of nitrogen and phosphorus and the consequent eutrophication
   of water to different degrees. The central theme of this work is an
   evaluation of the relative impact that different degrees of development
   have had on the production of nitrogen and phosphorus in relation to the
   specific use of land in three river basins draining into reservoirs in
   the Madrid Community (Valmayor, Santillana and Pinilla). The data
   corresponding to the three reservoirs were studied over a period of two
   years (October 1988 to October 1990) during which hydrological entries
   into the reservoir by different means were determined (runoff from the
   main entries into the reservoir, direct precipitation on the reservoir
   and subterranean supplies). To do this we have started with a Model
   Basin-unaffected-having in common with the three river basins studied
   the use of the land that represents the natural geochemical source of
   nutrients. Using this Basic Model of a basin we can also establish a
   series of recommendations to achieve the reversal of environmental
   impacts that may have arisen and starting with this an estimate has been
   made of the increase in the production of nutrients due to
   anthropication in the whole area of study, considering all the
   hydrological contributions as well as nutrients contributed in relation
   to the characteristics of the river basins, mainly in that which refers
   to the use of the surrounding land. We can conclude that the greater the
   development of the basin the farther the characteristic hydraulic
   contribution from its original, unaltered state, and that the
   contribution of nutrients is very closely related to the specific
   hydrology of each supplying river basin.}},

Abstract = {{In situ measurements of the coagulation/sedimentation of natural
   submicron iron particles in the oxic-anoxic interface of a eutrophic
   lake are described. Such measurements allow to understand the scavenging
   role of iron oxyhydroxide particles and give an insight on the role of
   organic matter on the coagulation of submicron colloids. A special
   sedimentation tube has been designed and built for this purpose.
   Experimental conditions have been determined to avoid artifacts during
   sedimentation measurements. An order of magnitude for the sedimentation
   rate of iron particles in lakes has been determined. Theoretical
   predictions have been made based on a classical
   coagulation/sedimentation model where the kinetics of coagulation is
   described by Smoluchowski's equations and sedimentation is characterized
   by Stokes' law. The nature and morphology of submicron colloid
   aggregates, in particular of those containing lake-born iron
   oxyhydroxides, have been investigated by Transmission Electron
   Microscopy in conjunction with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy.
   Experimental sedimentation results are discussed and compared both to
   model predictions and Transmission Electron Microscopy observations.
   Both sedimentation rates and Transmission Electron Microscopy results
   emphasize the important role of organic matter present in lakewaters,
   particularly of non fulvic organic macromolecules, on the
   coagulation/sedimentation processes of iron particles.}},

Abstract = {{COD and nitrogen balances were performed on four different types of
   laboratory-scale activated sludge system: aerobic, anoxic,
   anoxic-aerobic and anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic (biological excess
   phosphorus removal systems). The systems included a variety of
   configurations, with differing wastewater characteristics and operating
   parameters. The results suggest that good COD balances are to be
   expected in aerobic and anoxic-aerobic systems. Systems incorporating
   anaerobic zones exhibit low COD balances (less than 80\%). Fermentation
   in the anaerobic zone apparently is implicated in this `'loss'' of COD.
   The consequences of the COD `'loss'' include both a significant decrease
   in oxygen requirements and in sludge production compared to aerobic or
   anoxic-aerobic systems. Possible mechanisms for the loss of COD and
   areas which require further study are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{UASB reactors started up well using phenol as the sole carbon source,
   and by day 46, COD removal efficiency was 100\%. Pentachlorophenol (PCP)
   was then introduced at a concentration of 1 mg/l. Sequential appearance
   of tri-, di- and ultimately mono-chlorophenols was observed in the
   reactor effluent. After 70 days of operation, only 3-chlorophenol was
   detected in the reactor effluent. Increasing PCP concentrations led to
   transient appearance of PCP and other polysubstituted constituents in
   the reactor effluent; however, no toxic effects were observed over the
   range of PCP concentrations examined. Using phenol as an additional
   carbon source, the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor proved
   capable of reducing highly chlorinated phenolic compounds into lightly
   chlorinated phenolics more amenable to subsequent aerobic degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular oxygen-induced enhancement in the adsorption capacity of GAC
   was investigated thoroughly from sorbate types point of view. Iostherm
   studies on phenol, o-cresol, and 4-nitrophenol at 23 degrees C showed a
   20-163\% increase in retention capacities with the incremental capacity
   increasing with decreasing equilibrium concentrations. The incremental
   capacity was strongly dependent on the DO to GAC mass ratio and the
   adsorptive capacity under anoxic conditions. The phenomenon was observed
   when oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide and potassium
   permanganate were used instead of molecular oxygen. CC-MS analysis
   performed on GAC extracts suggested polymerization of adsorbates on the
   carbon surface as a potential reason for this enhancement phenomenon.
   Four different aliphatic compounds namely chloroform, bromoform, 1,1,1
   trichloromethane, and 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane were also studied. The
   results showed no significant effect on the adsorptive capacity of GAC
   for those aliphatics due to dissolved oxygen existence in the test
   environment. Significant enhancement was found in the case of wastewater
   samples from both domestic and industrial sources.}},

Abstract = {{Previously it was shown that the high molecular weight (HMW) fractions
   of C and E-stage kraft bleachery effluents are very resistant to
   microbial degradation but are decolorized and dechlorinated by abiotic
   sunlight-dependent and sunlight-independent processes. In this work, to
   better understand the importance and mechanisms of this light-mediated
   effluent decolorization and AOX mineralization, two artificial light
   sources with defined outputs and spectra were used to irradiate hardwood
   and softwood HMW effluent fractions. Both longwave u.v. and blue-green
   visible light were effective in mineralizing a large fraction of the AOX
   to chloride ions, and in decolorizing the effluent over several days.
   Photo-decolorization showed a strong oxygen dependence while AOX
   mineralization did not. Visible light at an intensity comparable to the
   sun at the Earth's surface in northern latitudes mineralized a
   substantial proportion of the `'stable'' HMW AOX, in both fresh and salt
   water, and at low and high effluent dilutions. Such light also
   mineralized an appreciable fraction of the HMW carbon to CO, by abiotic
   mechanisms. The hardwood HMW fraction showed insignificant toxicity as
   measured by a bacterial toxicity test, both before and after extensive
   photolysis.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of a low BOD/COD ratio landfill leachate was conducted by
   means of electrochemical oxidation process in this investigation. Under
   the operating conditions of 15 A/dm(2) current density and 7500 mg/l
   additional chloride concentration, 92\% of the COD in the landfall
   leachate was removed after electrolysis for 240 min with a ternary
   Sn-Pd-Ru oxide-coated titanium (SPR) anode. At the same time, about 2600
   mg/l of ammonium in the landfill leachate was also removed completely.
   These results indicate that the electrochemical oxidation process is
   effective in removing pollutants from landfill leachate. In this
   investigation, the effects of operating parameters including anode
   material, current density, and chloride concentration on both
   chlorine/hypochlorite production and landfill leachate treatment
   efficiency were studied. It was found that the operating factors have
   the same effects on both chlorine/hypochlorite production efficiency and
   landfill leachate treatment efficiency. The results suggest that the
   removal of pollutants from landfill leachate by electrochemical
   oxidation process could be mainly attributed to the indirect oxidation
   effect of chlorine/hypochlorite produced during the electrolysis. Among
   the four anode materials investigated in this study, including graphite,
   PbO2/Ti, DSA(R), and SPR anodes, the SPR anode having a high
   electrocatalytic activity gave the best chlorine/hypochlorite production
   efficiency and landfill leachate treatment efficiency. In addition, the
   increases in both operating current density and chloride concentration
   also enhanced the indirect oxidation effect in the electrochemical
   oxidation treatment of landfill leachate.}},

Abstract = {{Inactivation data with ozone in a CSTR system were analyzed using
   error-in-variables method (EVM), forced linearization and classical
   nonlinear regression. Their relative efficiency was compared
   statistically. The Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that the EVM
   produces parameter estimates with the least bias and minimum variance of
   residuals from the regression. Although used traditionally, the forced
   linearization would give the biased parameter estimates of kinetics and
   lead to the potential of misinterpreting the type of inactivation.
   Requiring the ad hoc assumption of first order decay rate, the classical
   nonlinear regression is of little use in practice. Fitting the kinetic
   model to experimental data shows that the behavior of the bacteria and
   virus inactivation can be well described by predictions from EVM
   estimates. The resultant coefficient of dilution (n), defined as
   equation (1) was found to be much higher than one, indicating that the
   ozone concentration is a dominant factor over the contact time in
   determining the efficiency of ozone disinfection processes.}},

Abstract = {{A real leachate from a landfill site of old landfill-age was treated by
   the biological activated carbon fluidized bed (BACFB) process.
   Steady-state removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and changes in
   molecular size distribution, adsorption characteristics and amount of
   humic substances of the leachate were evaluated as a function of the
   hydraulic retention time (HRT).
   The steady-state removal of the leachate DOC was enhanced from 42 to
   58\% when the HRT was increased from 24 to 96 h, indicating that
   biological oxidation was indeed responsible for the removal of the
   leachate organics. This increase was found to be due primarily to the
   biodegration of the leachate organics of low molecular weight (LMW); the
   high-molecular-weight organics may be highly refractory. Activated
   carbon preferentially adsorbed the LMW organics of both the leachate and
   the BACFB-treated effluents. This preferential adsorption was consistent
   with the removal of the LMW organics by the BACFB process. Adsorption
   may act as a prerequisite step toward biodegradation. Humic substances
   accounted for about 30\% of the leachate DOC. The BACFB process removed
   about 70\% of the humics with a HRT of 24 h; however, the concentration
   of the humics remained constant (about 10 mg 1(-1)) with increasing HRT.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of heavy metals on the structure of phytoplankton and
   zooplankton communities were determined in Sado River, Portugal, during
   the period of highest production (summer). Two tributaries, receiving
   wastes from pyrite mines, enter the river and gave rise, in the middle
   reaches, to dissolved metal concentrations up to 88 mu gl(-1) Cu, 2.6 mu
   gl(-1) Cd and 1800 mu gl(-1) Zn. At the most polluted sites
   phytoplankton responded mainly by a shift towards metal resistant
   species: dominant species such as Rhodomonas minuta, Synedra ulna,
   Crucigenia tetrapedia and Stephanodiscus hantzschii were replaced by
   Gomphonema parvulum, Scenedesmus armatus and Nitzschia frustulum, while
   the total algal standing crop was not significantly affected. In
   contrast, zooplankton displayed a strong reduction in the abundance of
   major groups (40-100\%), species richness (59\%) and diversity
   (58-75\%), and only a few taxa, namely Acanthocyclops robustus, Arcella
   vulgaris, Philodina sp., seemed to tolerate high metal concentrations.
   At the lower river reaches, where metal contamination decreased
   substantially, a recovery in species composition and abundance was
   observed for both plankton communities.}},

Abstract = {{Moringa oleifera is a tropical plant whose seeds contain an edible oil
   and water soluble substance which has excellent coagulation properties
   for treating water and wastewater. The efficiency and properties of
   Moringa oleifera as a natural coagulant in water treatment were studied
   and compared with alum, which is presently the most widely used
   industrial coagulant. It is shown that the active agents in aqueous
   Moringa extracts are dimeric cationic proteins, having molecular weight
   of 13 kDa and isoelectric points between 10 and 11. The mechanism of
   coagulation with Moringa oleifera appears to consist of adsorption and
   neutralization of the colloidal charges. Compared to alum, the optimal
   dosage of shelled Moringa oleifera seeds was almost the same (50 mg/l).
   In case of the non-shelled seeds, the dosage is greater (500 mg/l) for
   low initial turbidity waters. The purified proteins are more effective
   coagulants than alum. As a coagulant, Moringa is non-toxic and
   biodegradable. It is environmentally friendly, and unlike alum, does not
   significantly affect the pH and conductivity of the water after the
   treatment. Sludge produced by coagulation with Moringa is not only
   innocuous but also four to five times less in Volume than the chemical
   sludge produced by alum coagulation. So, as a coagulant, Moringa
   oleifera may be a potentially viable substitute to alum.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfur and nitrogen containing malodorous compounds were identified and
   quantified in the samples taken from each step of sewage treatment
   employing aerated biofilters for advanced treatment. The sulfur
   compounds hydrogen sulfide, carbon disulfide, methyl mercaptan, dimethyl
   sulfide and dimethyl disulfide were detected by using GC-FPD with a
   headspace method and a modified purge and cold trap method. With a purge
   and cold trap method and a FPD system, the minimum detectable
   concentration of dissolved sulfur containing volatiles reached the
   ngl(-1) level. As nitrogen containing compounds, indole, 3-methylindole,
   trimethylamine, dimethylamine and n-propylamine were present in the same
   wastewater samples. To determine indole and 3-methylindole, n-hexane
   extraction method was used, and for identifying and quantifying primary
   and secondary phase aliphatic amines, derivatization with
   o-phtalaldehyde (OPA) and N-succinimdyl p-nitrophenylacetate (SNPA) was
   applied with HPLC. Trimethylamine was identified by directly injecting
   the filtered samples into GC-FTD. Detectable concentration of dissolved
   low aliphatic amines and indoles was about 10 mu g(-1). Large amounts of
   nitrogen containing compounds remained after secondary treatment
   compared with sulfur containing compounds.}},

Abstract = {{The roadside gully pot is a major component of many drainage systems
   used to protect the downstream sewers and receiving waters from
   excessive sediment deposits. This work aims to investigate the solids
   retention efficiency of a full size concrete pot by means of a
   laboratory test rig. Results from single-size quartz sand particles show
   that, for a given pot size, retention is influenced primarily by
   influent flow rate and particle diameter and to a lesser extent,
   retained sediment bed height. The major retention mechanism was
   postulated to be sedimentation within an hydraulically completely mixed
   environment. Transient re-erosion of the deposited bed was noted under
   extreme conditions with steady state concentrations never exceeding 10
   mg/l. A model based on the proposed removal mechanisms was tested and
   shown to be in good agreement with the data.}},

Title = {{EFFICACY AND ROLE OF ALUM IN REMOVAL OF ZEBRA MUSSEL VELIGER LARVAE FROM
   RAW WATER-SUPPLIES}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The study had four objectives: (1) to determine if alum in
   concentrations used by water utilities and industries kills zebra mussel
   veliger larvae; (2) to determine if alum as a coagulant kills veliger
   larvae; (3) to determine if the flocculant or the flocculation process
   affects the survival or settling rate (by entrapment in the floc) of
   veliger larvae; and (4) to determine if prechlorination affects the
   efficacy of alum. The results obtained from bioassays for the four
   objectives were compared to those on jar tests of water samples from
   Ontario Water Treatment Plants. All experiments were performed in a
   laboratory on the shore of Lake Erie at Wheatley, Ontario. The main
   findings for each objective were: (1) that the concentrations of alum
   used in most water treatment plants (i.e. 10-30 ppm was not sufficient
   to kill the veliger larvae because the 24-h, LC(50) value was 130.5 ppm
   with a 24-h incipient lethal level of 100 ppm. However, additions of
   alum which depressed the pH below 5 caused instantaneous kill of
   veligers. Therefore, due to the toxicity of both hydrogen ions and alum,
   significant mortality of veligers will occur in the mixing chamber of
   alum. (2) The acute toxicity tests suggest that the flocculation process
   (3-h LC(50) = 76 ppm is significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05)
   more effective at removing veligers than is the coagulation process (3-h
   LC(50) = 115 ppm). (3) The role of alum in removal of veligers under
   standard treatment conditions (i.e. 10-30 ppm alum) appears to be mainly
   a physical one, with the flee physically removing even living veligers.
   (4) Prechlorination in combination with alum greatly improves the
   removal of veligers from raw water supplies over the alum alone. Most
   veligers remain alive for at least 24 h in the flee at concentrations
   below 100 ppm. In summary, alum will remove veliger larvae by chemical
   toxicity in the mixing zones where chemical gradients exist for alum,
   hydrogen ions, and chlorine and by physical removal through flocculation
   of both living and dead veligers.}},

Abstract = {{Photocatalytic oxidation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) by CdS in the
   presence and absence of thioacetamide as a function of pH has been
   studied. Based upon the trends in the appearance of different
   intermediates such as benzene and hydroxylated biphenyl, it is proposed
   that 2,4-DCP oxidation by positive holes (h(+)) is favored at pH less
   than 6, while oxidation by hydroxyl radicals (.OH) becomes dominant at
   pH greater than 6. This is evidenced by the intermediates detected at
   different pH values. In the absence of thioacetamide (TA), benzene was
   detected as the only intermediate at pH ranging from 4 to 5. When pH
   changed from 5 to 9, no benzene was detected. Highly hydroxylated
   intermediates, such as hydroxylated biphenyl, were the major
   intermediates. When TA was present, it may act as a `'bridge'' between,
   2,4-DCP and CdS through its thiol functional group. Therefore, a shift
   of the optimal pH for 2,4-DCP oxidation from 5 to 9 was observed and no
   hydroxylated biphenyl were detected.}},

Abstract = {{The ozonation process of p-coumaric acid in aqueous solution is studied
   by identification and quantitative evaluation of intermediates and final
   oxidation products. In all the investigated pH range (2.0-8.0) the
   initial oxidation step is represented by the direct attack of ozone to
   the exocyclic double bond, following oxidation steps being regulated by
   the intervention of also the radical ozonation mechanism. The
   competition degree between the two mechanisms is significantly
   influenced by pH of the reacting mixture with a remarkable occurrence of
   the radical mechanism at basic pH. The high reactivities exhibited
   towards ozone by p-coumaric acid and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde intermediate
   make the rate of the ozonation process strictly controlled by diffusion.
   Product analysis allows to assess that direct ozonation mechanism of
   p-hydroxybenzaldehyde significantly proceeds through the anomalous
   reaction pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Many of the wetlands on the Swan Coastal Plain, Western Australia are
   nutrient-rich and subject to blooms of blue-green algae. Some of these
   wetlands, however, are dystrophic and are less likely to experience
   algal blooms possibly because of high gilvin levels.
   Gilvin (yellow colour determined by absorbance at 440 nm) levels and the
   octanol/water partition coefficient (Khow) for humic stained waters from
   eleven wetlands and the leachate from the leaves of two Eucalyptus tree
   species and Bassendean soil, all major components of the Swan Coastal
   Plain, Western Australia were determined.
   Gilvin levels in the wetlands were high (20-58 m(-1)) while gilvin in
   leachate from Eucalyptus marginata leaves soaked for 30 days was 349
   m(-1) and gilvin in Bassendean soil leachate was 610 m(-1). Gilvin from
   E. calophylla leaves soaked for 30 days was markedly less (67 m(-1)).
   Three samples, the leachate from the leaves of E. calophylla, the
   leachate from the top 50 cm of Bassendean soil and water from one
   wetland (Gingin) showed ecologically significant Khow values ranging
   from 1.68 to 3.59 at pH 4. These Khow's derived are similar to many
   organic chemicals in use today including algicides and herbicides.
   It is suggested that inhibition of algal growth and production will
   occur in the humic stained waters of Gingin wetland. A probable source
   of this humus rich material is decomposing Eucalyptus leaves and other
   material in the upper horizon of Bassendean soils of the wetland
   catchment.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of influent loading rate on mass removal of BOD, SS and
   faecal coliforms (FC) from dairy parlour wastewaters was compared in
   four pairs of planted (Schoenoplectus validus) and unplanted gravel-bed
   wetlands (each 19 m(2)). The wetlands were operated at nominal retention
   times of 7, 5.5, 3 and 2 days, with in and outflows sampled fortnightly
   over a 20 month period. Hydraulic flows were monitored to enable
   calculation of the mass flows of pollutants. Influent water quality
   varied markedly over the trial period (CBOD5, 20-300 g m(-3); SS, 60-250
   g m(-3); FC, 10(3)-10(6) MPN (100 ml(-1)). NBOD was an important
   component of total BOD, being around 1.5 times higher than the influent
   CBOD5, and 2-10 times higher than the effluent CBOD5. Outflow levels of
   CBOD5, SS and faecal coliforms rapidly mirrored changes in influent
   loadings. Mean mass removal of CBOD5 increased from 60-75\% to 85-90\%,
   total BOD (CBOD5 + NBOD) from 50 to 80\% and FC from 90-95 to >99\% with
   increasing wetland retention time during the first 12 months of
   monitoring. Mean annual SS removals of 75-85\% were recorded
   irrespective of loading rate. High levels of dissolved humic colour in
   the wastewaters were little affected by passage through the wetland at
   short retention times, but were reduced by up to 40\% at longer
   retentions. Mass removals of CBOD5, SS and FC showed monotonic
   relationships to mass loading rates, with little difference between the
   performance of planted and unplanted wetlands, except for CBOD5 at high
   loadings (> 3 g m(-2) d(-1)). The planted wetlands showed significantly
   improved removal rates For CBOD5 at higher loadings, and 1.3 to 2.6 fold
   higher mass removals of total BOD.}},

Abstract = {{A co-immobilized mixed culture system of denitrifying bacteria and
   methanogenic bacteria, obtained by entrapping two sorts of acclimated
   sludges in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel beads, was developed.
   Denitrification and methanogenesis with methanol employed as a carbon
   substrate using the co-immobilized system were investigated under an
   anoxic condition. Methane formation could occur only after the
   completion of denitrification, which was associated with the removal of
   the surplus methanol. Enhancing the denitrification activity of the
   beads could accelerate the production rate of methane, while increasing
   the methanogenic activity did not affect denitrification. Substrate
   diffusion in the gel beads may play an important role in denitrification
   process. This was resulted from the effect of particle sizes and an
   observed dense growth of denitrifiers which primarily appeared on the
   surface of the beads. The simultaneous production of nitrogen and
   methane gases, in continuous culture, has elucidated that
   denitrification and methanogenesis could proceed with in one reactor.
   Microscopic observation revealed that a Hyphomicrobium-like bacterium (a
   denitrifier) grew mainly on the peripheral surface while a
   Methanosarcina-like bacterium (a methanogen) grew in the inner part of
   the gel beads. A metabolic process for synchronous denitrification and
   methane production of the co-immobilized mixed culture system in a PVA
   gel bead was proposed.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of PCB concentration on microbial reductive dechlorination
   was examined using two individual congeners, 2,3,4- and
   2,3,4,2',4',5'-chlorobiphenyl (CBP), at four concentrations ranging from
   4 to 35 ppm. Dechlorination potential in PCB-contaminated river
   sediments was also determined as the length of the lag period in a
   single congener dechlorination assay using contaminated sediments as
   inocula. Dechlorination of 2,3,4-CBP was concentration-dependent and
   occurred at all concentrations by 14 weeks and the residual
   concentration of the parent congener appeared to be the same regardless
   of the initial concentrations. By contrast, 2,3,4,2',4',5'-CBP showed
   dechlorination only at the highest concentration after 23 weeks. The
   concentration dependence and the lag period thus were congener-specific.
   Dechlorination potential, measured as the length of the lag before
   dechlorination of 3,4,5-CBP, seemed to be longer with inocula prepared
   from sediments with lower ambient PCB concentrations. Taken together,
   these results imply that in situ dechlorination may not be able to occur
   in areas with low ambient PCB levels because both dechlorination rate
   and dechlorination potential are concentration-dependent. In sediments
   which are no longer submerged, dechlorinating activity was not found.}},

Abstract = {{The production of nitrocellulose (NC) creates large quantities of waste
   NC fines in wash water streams. Current processing techniques attempt to
   remove these fines by cross-flow microfiltration, air flotation,
   settling, centrifugation and lime precipitation. To date, no fundamental
   study investigating the interfacial thermodynamics of these fines has
   been reported. This work explored the stability of NC fines in water
   employing the DLVO model and the more recently developed extended DLVO
   (ExDLVO) model as described by van Oss and colleagues {[}van Oss C. J.,
   Chaudhury M. K. and Good R. J. (1988) Chem. Rev. 88, 927-941]. Both
   models predicted that NC fines will become unstable and coagulate, with
   the addition of a 1:1 indifferent electrolyte at ionic strengths greater
   than approx. 5 mM. The ExDLVO theory, which accounts for Lewis acid-base
   (AB) interactions, predicted greater attractive potential energy
   availability. Experimental studies corroborated modeling predictions.
   Results indicate that NC fines may be easily destabilized allowing
   potential reuse.}},

Abstract = {{A rotating tube bioreactor (RTB) was developed to examine chemical
   degradation by fungal biofilms under controlled laboratory conditions.
   Each RTB consists of a sealed tube containing mycelia growing on a piece
   of steel mesh on the inside wall of the tube. Tubes are mounted
   horizontally in a tube rotator and slowly rotated to expose the fungal
   biofilm to a wetting-aeration cycle typical of fixed film reactors such
   as trickling filters and rotating biological contactors. The extent of
   pentachlorophenol (PCP) dehalogenation by three different species of
   fungal biofilms was evaluated by measuring concentrations of PCP (using
   HPLC) and the total concentrations of organic and inorganic halides
   (using a TOX analyzer). The three species of fungi removed PCP from
   solution at similar rates, but they differed in ability to completely
   dehalogenate PCP. Nitrogen-deficient growth media only slightly
   increased the extent of PCP mineralization, All species of fungi (grown
   on nitrogen-sufficient media) removed PCP to <0.1 mg l(-1) (> 99\%
   removal) within 1 d. Within 8 d, the greatest percent of dehalogenation,
   measured by the appearance of chloride ion in solution, was achieved by
   Trametes versicolor (62\%), followed by Phanerochaete chrysosporium
   (38\%) and Inonotus dryophilus (21\%). These removals based on chloride
   ion concentrations are comparable to claims by others of complete
   mineralization for recoveries of 10-50\% of (CO2)-C-14 from C-14-labeled
   PCP in static flask cultures.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper reports on work performed on the recovery of proteins
   suspended in the effluent of a soybean protein plant. The work involved
   studies of effluent characterization, protein suspension
   destabilization, dissolved air flotation (DAF) and gravity settling. The
   flotation and settling tests were performed both at a batch bench scale
   and at a continuous plant scale in the actual industrial operation. The
   soybean proteins, present as a colloidal suspension in the effluent, are
   dispersed by combined electrostatic repulsion and steric stabilization
   mechanisms. The destabilization and aggregation of the proteins into
   high quality flocs were achieved by addition of 200-300 mg/l FeCl3,
   setting the pH at the isoelectric point of the proteins (pH 4.5) and an
   anionic polyacrylamide polymer (high molecular weight) dosage of 2-3
   mg/l. The bench scale tests indicated under these conditions that a
   solid-liquid separation can be made by both DAF and gravity settling
   with DAF giving superior results. However, in the industrial plant
   tests, gravity settling proved generally to give better separation
   efficiencies. In plant operation the DAF process worked well only if the
   flocs were sufficiently hydrophobic and resistant to mechanical
   degradation, which was not always true in the actual operation. The
   settling process was much less sensitive to feed stock variations.}},

Abstract = {{The paper investigates the effect of adding an external carbon source on
   the rate of denitrification in an alternating activated sludge process
   including biological P removal. Two carbon sources were examined,
   acetate and hydrolysate derived from biologically hydrolyzed sludge.
   Preliminary batch experiments performed in 5 liter bottles indicated
   that the denitrification rate can be instantaneously increased through
   the addition of either carbon source. The amount by which the rate was
   increased depended on the amount of carbon added. In the main
   experiments performed in a pilot scale alternating process, the addition
   of either carbon source to the anoxic zone also resulted in an
   instantaneous and fairly reproducible increase in the denitrification
   rate. Some release of phosphate associated with the carbon source
   addition was observed. With respect to nitrogen removal, these results
   indicate that external carbon source addition may serve as a suitable
   control variable to improve process performance.}},

   determined by the persulfate and Walkley-Black methods were
   significantly lower for the freshwater samples (paired-difference

Abstract = {{The inactivation of coliform bacteria and poliovirus 1 was studied in
   secondary wastewater effluent containing suspensions of titanium dioxide
   (250 mg l(-1)) irradiated with either F40BL fluorescent lights or

   inactivation of coliform bacteria under laboratory lights, while the
   two-log inactivation of poliovirus 1 occurred in approximately 30 min.
   No differences in photocatalytic disinfection rates were found when the
   assays were conducted in the pH range of 5-8. The results show that
   poliovirus 1 was effectively inactivated by titanium dioxide
   photocatalysis, and the rates were more rapid than for the inactivation
   of coliform bacteria. However, the photocatalytic disinfection of
   effluents using titanium dioxide under sunlight may be limited due to
   the relatively low inactivation rates and resulting long contact times
   compared to conventional disinfection methods.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of flow pattern on the microbial community of biofilm
   systems is relevant for process analysis, reactor selection and
   microbial ecology control. The interaction between reactor type, shear
   stress, microbial population, intrinsic kinetics, and biofilm
   performance for biofilm systems was studied by comparing experimental
   results of three reactors: a batch reactor representing plug flow, and a
   CSTR and an indoor channel reactor with recirculation, two
   configurations of continuous stirred tank reactors but with different
   shear stress. Cocci co-existed with filaments (mainly Sphaerotilus
   natans) in the batch reactor biofilm, whereas filaments predominated in
   the other two reactors. The values of the Monod constants mu(max) and
   K-s of the biofilm biomass of the batch reactor were 2.8 day(-1) and 54
   mg(glucose)/l at 28 degrees C, whereas in the CSTR and channel they were
   1.3 day(-1) and 2.9 mg/l, and 1.5 day(-1) and 2.7 mg/l, respectively.
   The oxygen consumption coefficients of biofilm decreased from 50 to 10\%
   (gO(2)/gglu), when biofilm surface loading increased from 50 to 400
   gglu/m(2).day in the CSTR and channel reactors. An analogy was found
   between intrinsic microbial kinetics and the corresponding macroscopic
   biofilm kinetics. A conceptual model of these interactions was proposed.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main problems concerning drip irrigation by effluents is the
   clogging of drippers and emitters, which, due to their small diameters,
   are extremely vulnerable to clogging by effluent constituents. Earlier
   observations revealed that this phenomenon can be reduced if effluents
   are treated with oxidants. In order to realize the role of oxidants in
   these processes, and to obtain meaningful and reproducible results,
   synthetic effluents rather than authentic effluents were used. However,
   the synthetic effluents were composed so as to provide the best possible
   resemblance to natural effluents, and the effects of Cl-2 and ClO2 on
   their constituents were studied.
   The demand of these effluents for Cl-2 was 5-8 mg l(-1) and for ClO2 3-4
   mg l(-1). Two mg l(-1) of either oxidant caused a very fast bacteria
   inactivation that reached four orders of magnitude after 1 min. However,
   with respect to algae, concentrations up to 20 mg l(-1) of either
   oxidant did not affect the number of algae cells, although they caused a
   remarkable decrease in algal viability as expressed by its chlorophyll
   content and replication ability. Both oxidants have demonstrated a
   notable aggregation effect on the effluents.
   The conclusions of the results described above were examined in a pilot
   system. Continued chlorination by 5-10 mg l(-1) Cl-2 applied directly to
   the drippers was not very effective. The reason for this was the
   presence of clogging agents, `'immune'' to low Cl-2 concentrations,
   produced as early as in the reservoir, and carried down to the drippers
   by the effluent stream. Batch treatment combined with settling was much
   more efficient, and reduced the clogging significantly, because in this
   case the Cl-2 reacted not only as a disinfectant, but also as a
   coagulant due to the oxidation of humic constituents.}},

Abstract = {{As indicated in most literature reports, the solubility of
   pentachlorophenol (PCP) in water ranges between 10 and 20 mg l(-1).
   Since PCP is a weak acid (pK(a) 4.35), its solubility increases
   drastically with increasing pH. When PCP dissolves in water two forms
   are normally present: undissociated PCP (PCP degrees) and a dissociated
   anionic form, i.e. pentachlorophenolate (PCP-). Both forms differ in
   their physico-chemical properties and in their microbial response and
   toxicity. It is therefore important to know the solubility behaviour of
   PCP at specific pHs when working with site remediation and toxicity
   assessment. While anionic PCP is very soluble, experimental data have
   shown that undissociated PCP has a solubility limited to 10 mu M (3 mg
   l(-1)). Theoretical calculations have confirmed this value to be
   independent of the solution's pH. A non-empirical model was developed
   for estimating the `'total'' PCP aqueous solubility at different pHs
   using the standard solubility value and PCP's dissociation constant. The
   method may be extended to other chlorophenols and to most wastewaters.}},

   first-order kinetic for the hydrolysis of particulate organics.
   Biodegradation of hydrolyzed particulates is treated in a simlar way to
   the soluble organics by using an `'effective soluble BOD'' term which
   combines both BOD sources. Monod rate law is used for nitrification

Abstract = {{Particulate matter constitute over 50\% of the organic load in domestic
   wastewater. In activated sludge systems a portion of these particulates
   are hydrolysed and degraded. Experimental methods were developed and
   used for estimating the rate of hydrolysis of these particulates. These
   included ways to distinguish between biological and non-biological VSS
   in an activated sludge mixture. From batch experiments an average
   specific hydrolysis rate coefficient of 4.61 10(-4)l(mg day)(-1) was
   obtained for raw primary suspended solids and 6.63 10(-4)l(mg day)(-1)
   for non-settleable suspended solids. The specific hydrolysis rate
   coefficients for raw wastewater in continuous flow experiments was
   determined as 3.07 10(-3)l(mg day)(-1), which is substantially higher
   than in batch tests.}},

Abstract = {{Collection and analysis of pore water has become an important aspect of
   many environmental programs. Pore water analyses are used for toxicity
   identification, sediment quality assessment and diagenetic studies. This
   paper reviews the four commonly used methods for collection of pore
   water and potential artifacts from their use, particularly in the
   preparation of samples for trace metal analysis. Two of the methods,
   centrifugation and squeezing, are ex situ, requiring the removal of
   sediment from the natural environment. The other two, dialysis and
   suction filtration, are used in situ. Each method has its advantages and
   disadvantages, and usage must be determined by the individual
   researcher. The handling of most samples should be conducted in an inert
   atmosphere until pore water samples are acidified because oxidation has
   been shown to significantly alter sample speciation. Significant errors
   have also been found to result from temperature alteration. Sample
   contamination by fine particles is important in all methods as
   differentiation of particulate and soluble components is based on
   membrane pore size.}},

Abstract = {{In this work a novel extractive membrane bioreactor has been used to
   overcome air-stripping problems which occur during aerobic treatment of
   1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) contaminated wastewaters. The operation of a
   conventional air-lift bioreactor at a wastewater residence time of 11.6
   h led to 25-34\% of the DCE supplied to the reactor being lost to the
   exit gas stream. In contrast, employing the novel membrane bioreactor
   resulted in negligible (1.5\%) air stripping at the same wastewater
   flowrate. The membrane bioreactor operates by separating the DCE
   containing wastewater from the aerated biomedium. This is achieved by
   means of a silicone rubber membrane which is coiled around a perspex
   draft tube. DCE diffuses across the silicone rubber membrane and into a
   biofilm growing attached to the surface of the membrane, while oxygen
   diffuses into the biofilm from the biomedium side. Oxygen and DCE meet
   in the biofilm and degradation occurs without the DCE being directly
   exposed to the aerating gas stream.
   Of the DCE supplied to the membrane bioreactor, 94.5\% was biodegraded
   during operation of this system, and approximately 65\% of the carbon
   entering the system was evolved as CO2. A mathematical model has been
   used to describe the transfer of DCE across the membrane and subsequent
   diffusion and reaction of DCE and O-2 in the biofilm attached to the
   membrane tubes. Parameters describing microbial growth kinetics on DCE
   were determined using a CSTR bioreactor. The results of the mathematical
   analysis confirmed that the biofilm has two major effects on system
   performance: (a) it prevents direct contact between DCE and the aerating
   gas, thus avoiding air stripping; and (b) it limits the flux of DCE
   across the membrane with consequent accumulation of DCE at the
   membrane-biofilm interface, which reduces the mass transfer driving
   force for DCE extraction from the wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{The toxic effect of two or more trace metals which exist simultaneously
   in seawater on micro-organisms was studied. Seawater is a very
   complicated medium and the combined effect of multi-pollutants is even
   more complicated. Three categories of reciprocal effect exist: additive,
   synergism and antagonism, depending on the species distribution of the
   metals, algae and the comparative concentrations of each metal.
   For the Phaeosactylum-Cu-Zn-Cd system, antagonism occurs if Cd/Cu is in
   the range of 0.4 to 4, but synergism appeared beyond this concentration
   range; zinc and copper presented antagonism when the ratio of Zn/Cu was
   between 1 and 20, synergism appeared out of this range; the total
   toxicity was contributed by Cd when Zn was low and was controlled by Zn
   when Zn was high. The mechanism of such interaction was also studied.}},

Abstract = {{Activated sludge was examined in a continuously stripped batch reactor
   and in closed serum bottles for the production of the volatile
   denitrification intermediates nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O).
   During the experiments in the reactor all compounds of the
   denitrification pathway were monitored and a mass balance was made. From
   the time profiles of the concentrations the production and consumption
   rates were calculated. During denitrification with nitrate (NO3-) as the
   first electron acceptor neither NO nor N2O is accumulated in significant
   amounts. An increased gas stripping shows an increased production of the
   volatile intermediates. Pulsing nitrate- and acetate saturated
   denitrifying organisms with nitrite (NO2-) causes an accumulation of NO
   and N2O and a severe inhibition of all enzymes of the denitrification
   respiratory chain. Further pulsing nitrite to microorganisms with
   reduced denitrification metabolism does not result in NO and N2O
   accumulation and no severe inhibition of denitrification is observed.
   Experiments in serum bottles show that the bacteriostatic
   denitrification intermediate NO causes the inhibition. Experiments with
   NO addition confirm the proposed inhibition mechanism. However, slow
   transport mechanisms between the bulk media and the cell surface
   influence the concentration of NO in the immediate environment of the
   denitrifying organisms. It makes a difference whether NO is brought from
   the outside to the cells or whether it is produced by the organism
   itself.}},

Abstract = {{Effluents enriched with high suspended solids concentration were tested
   for disinfection with chlorine dioxide. Following disinfection with
   various chlorine dioxide concentrations from 0 mg/l to 52.78 mg/l and
   contact times from 2 up to 24 h, half of the experimental samples were
   crushed (by Ultra-Turax) and tested for survival of indicator
   microorganisms. The crushing process revealed that a certain fraction of
   indicator microorganisms were left intact as a result of chlorine
   dioxide disinfection. This fraction was found to be able to regrow as
   was shown for all bacterial indicators, such as coliforms, fecal
   coliforms, enterococci and heterotrophic count, despite high
   disinfectant concentrations. The study results indicate that some
   microorganisms fraction entrapped into suspended flocs can survive
   disinfection with chlorine dioxide, depending also on indicator type,
   therefore their prior removal by coagulation, sedimentation and
   filtration is a major prerequisite for successful disinfection.}},

Abstract = {{Trace elements concentrations were determined in alluvial sediment area
   threatened by construction and operation of the pharmaceutical/chemical
   plant. Results gained by instrumental neutron activation analysis
   (INAA), electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometry (ETAAS), cold
   vapour AAS (CVAAS), optical emission spectrography (OES) show great
   differences in element distribution between two solid phases at the
   pollution source; high concentrations of Cr, Cu, Pb, Hg, Ni and Zn in
   creek sediments and indication of pollution in the upper soil layer at
   the Sava river banks downstream at the creek mouth. Concentrations and
   enrichment factors of elements determined in upper, bottom and
   water-bearing layers between creek and water-field area are of natural
   values. Some enrichment found for Sr, Ba and Ag could be explained with
   high calcite-dolomite content. For the time being, soil upper layers act
   as chemical filter preventing vertical infiltration. At the same time,
   Gorjak (Smrdljivka) creek sediments, rich in organic matter, cause
   clogging and prevent intensive pollution of groundwater. Thus the
   quality of water exploited from the water-well field is not endangered
   so far.}},

Abstract = {{Mature larvae (glochidia) stripped from the gills of the freshwater
   clam, Anodonta cygnea zellensis Gmelin, were exposed to cadmium, copper
   and zinc at slightly alkaline (pH 8.0-8.3) and acid water (pH 4.5-5.0).
   In addition, metal-spiked medium with different hardnesses (4.5, 9, 18,
   35 and 58 mg Ca/l) was applied. To investigate the effect of sublethal
   maternal pre-exposure on the viability of the glochidia, preceding the
   glochidial harvest, some of the female clams carrying glochidia were
   exposed for two weeks to sublethal concentrations of Cd, Cu and Zn. The
   viability of the glochidia originating from the metal exposed females
   was studied in unspiked and metal-spiked water. Increasing water
   hardness did not in all cases improve the glochidial resistance to the
   metals. Low water pH had both a synergistic and an antagonistic effect
   on the toxicity of metals. Maternal pre-exposure at low metal
   concentrations often increased the resistance of glochidia to the
   metals, whereas pre-exposure at higher metal concentrations decreased
   glochidial resistance. The order of toxicity of the three metals studied
   was: Cu > Cd > Zn.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the risk of chemicals for the environment requires an
   estimation of degradation rates in order to evaluate a realistic
   exposure concentration for organisms. As QSAR's (quantitative structure
   activity relationships) for degradation are far from generally
   applicable, methods are proposed to extrapolate results obtained from
   standardized degradation tests to the most relevant environmental
   compartments. The design of the OECD laboratory test methods is such
   that, at least at the screening level, almost general applicability is
   achieved. Inevitably, tests conditions do not reflect biodegradation in
   the real world. However, if data are available on biodegradation it
   appears that, for most chemicals, references are made to one of those
   standardized OECD methods.
   A systematical procedure to translate the result of an OECD test (or a
   combination of test results) to transformation rates under realistic
   circumstances is still lacking. In this report a methodology is
   presented to evaluate standardized test results in terms of rate
   constants for degradation in a biological waste water treatment plant,
   surface water and aerobic soil. The extrapolation of a positive result
   in OECD screening tests relies a.o. on the assumption that the half-life
   is inversely proportional to the total concentration of micro-organisms.
   A first attempt was made to validate this extrapolation by comparing
   results of reported field studies on biodegradation of 20 chemicals with
   positive results in OECD Ready Biodegradability tests.}},

   carbohydrate waste, having a higher COD/VA ratio, produced filamentous
   microbes and these appeared to promote granulation. With the development
   of granulation, the applicable organic loading rates were increased for
   both reactors. The fixed film reactor generally had a consistent
   treatment capability with various waste.}},

Abstract = {{Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to quantify the strain
   Rhodococcus chlorophenolicus PCP-I added to activated sludge samples.
   Various pretreatment techniques were tested in a factorial design
   experiment for deflocculation of the activated sludge to optimize the
   recovery of R. chlorophenolicus. The best results were obtained by
   addition of 0.1\% V/V Tween 20, 0.5 min sonication, followed by
   appropriate sample dilution to obtain 10-50 cells in the microscope
   counting field (corresponding with a content of 7-35 10(6) cells in the
   3.5 cm(2) slide). The recovery of R. chlorophenolicus was more than 90\%
   compared with control samples without activated sludge.
   This method makes it possible to study biodegradation kinetics of the
   chlorophenol-degrading bacterial strain when present in mixed cultures,
   such as in activated sludge.}},

Abstract = {{Biological indices based on macroinvertebrates offer advantages for
   testing water quality. Nevertheless, a common criticism is that these
   indices show seasonal dependence. To elucidate this matter, 60 sits were
   sampled over a two-year cycle, and the BMWP' and ASPT' biotic indices
   (adaptation of the Biological Monitoring Working Party Score System and
   Average Score Per Taxon for the Iberian Peninsula) were calculated.
   Annual variations in the indices were studied (considering, separately,
   only non-polluted sites, and grouping polluted and clean-water sites
   together) and compared for changes in temperature, the factor most
   characteristic of seasonality. Moreover, the correlations with physical
   factors (altitude, slope of stretch, flow, temperature, distance from
   the source) and chemical parameters (pH, conductivity, nitrates,
   nitrites, ammonium, phosphates, chlorides, sulphates, calcium,
   magnesium, sodium, potassium, COD, iron, copper, zinc, lead, nickel,
   oils and fats, detergents and pesticides) were analysed. Both indices
   were found to be negatively related with parameters indicative of
   pollution. From a multiple regression, a good score prediction using
   physical and chemical data (for BMWP' as for ASPT') was obtained. For
   non-polluted sites. the variability of the BMWP' (and its significance
   with respect to water quality) in relation to seasonality was quite
   reduced and not significant, but the ASPT' showed a significant
   dependence on temperature. The relationship of these indices to
   temperature in all sites (polluted and clean) was negative in both
   cases, indicating that the relationship is caused more by pollution than
   by seasonality.}},

Abstract = {{A microbial enrichment culture was able to mineralise atrazine
   (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazine) supplied as sole
   carbon and energy source. The microorganisms were immobilised in a
   non-aerated fixed bed reactor with sintered glass beds as carrier
   matrix. Atrazine elimination was rapid, efficient and quantitative. With
   feed rates of up to 15.51 d(-1) of medium containing 7.5 mg l(-1)
   atrazine, the hydraulic retention time in the 300 mi reactor decreased
   to below 30 min. Atrazine effluent concentrations under these conditions
   were in the 10-100 mu g l(-1)-range. The mineralisation of atrazine
   became incomplete under oxygen deficient conditions observed with
   atrazine feed concentrations of 15 mg l(-1). However, complete atrazine
   conversion was regained and the effluent levels dropped to below 10 mu
   gl(-1) when NO(3)(-)ions (66 mg l(-1)) were supplemented to this medium.
   When {[}U-ring-C-14]atrazine (7-15 mg l(-1)) was used in the feed medium
   and a hydraulic residence time of 3.6 h was applied, atrazine was not
   detectable (< 0.2 mu gl(-1)) in the effluent. The yield of (CO2)-C-14,
   in relation to the radioactivity applied to the system was 33\% under
   C-Limited and 44\% under denitrifying conditions, respectively. Under
   low oxygen concentrations, only 77\% of the atrazine was converted, and
   only 12\% of the radioactivity was obtained as (CO2)-C-14,, whereas a
   total of 61\% of the radioactivity could be attributed to two water
   soluble metabolites,
   2-hydroxy-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazine and
   2-chloro-4-amino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazine.}},

Abstract = {{Arsenate(III) is the more toxic form of inorganic arsenic and its
   removal from drinking water is less effective as compared to
   arsenate(V). Arsenate(III) persists in aerated water, even at high pH,
   but is easily oxidized by manganese dioxides. The oxidation of As(III)
   follows a second order rate law with respect to As(III). The reaction
   rate is effected by the initial molar ratio of MnO2 to As(III), the
   respective rate order is 1.5. Calcium reduces the rate constant by the
   order of -0.2, whereas the pH has no influence (pH 5-10). There is no
   desorption of reduced manganese in the batch tests at high initial molar
   ratios. Flow-through-tests in small sand filters, loaded with manganese
   dioxide, showed a decreasing oxidation of As(III) in the first 60 h.
   Afterwards the oxidation increased again and was quantitative after 10
   days. It is concluded that the enhanced oxidation after this initial
   period is caused by bacteria, as some ubiquitous bacteria are involved
   in manganese oxidation. An application of this oxidation technique in
   drinking water treatment should be possible, because As(III)-oxidation
   is efficient and the release of soluble manganese is low.}},

Abstract = {{The selectivity of the kelp alginate gel for copper compared to cobalt
   was investigated. When copper and cobalt existed at relatively high
   concentrations (100 ppm each), Na-alginate solution was directly
   dispensed into the mixed solution circulating in a loop fluidized bed
   reactor to produce Cu/Co-alginate gels in situ. Two extended Langmuir
   models were derived and tested against experimental data in this work:
   Model 1 was a general Langmuir model for two absorbates competing for
   the same type of binding site. Model 2 was based on the `'egg-box''
   model for gelation of sodium alginate in the presence of divalent metal
   ions with the assumption that each metal ion would bind two carboxyl
   groups on neighboring uronate residues that formed the `'site''. It was
   found that Model 1 data better and parameters obtained from Model 1 were
   used to predict the amount of Na-alginate needed to `'polish'' a cobalt
   solution containing a trace amount of copper.}},

Abstract = {{The absorption of copper from synthetic solutions of cupric sulfate
   (initial Cu concentration: 200 ppm, initial pH: 2.4 or 3.4) in a batch

   Geesey G. G., Lopez S. L., Eastman S. L. and Wichlacz P. L., Wat. Res.
   24, 889-897 (1990)], the copper-binding efficiency of the alginate gels
   at pH 3.4 was affected mildly by the acidity of the solution; at pH 2.4,
   the percent copper recovered was reduced by roughly one-half. In this
   work, an extended Langmuir model that took into account the competition
   between monovalent hydrogen ions and divalent cupric ions for the
   carboxyl groups on the alginate molecules was derived. This model
   yielded the binding group density of the alginate gel and binding
   stability constants for cupric alginate and alginic acid simultaneously.
   The new model was shown to be superior to the simple Langmuir model that
   expressed the results as conditional copper binding stability constant

Pages = {{323-328}},

Abstract = {{Climatic characteristics of the coastal region require design
   considerations for land application systems that have been largely
   ignored or the bases for which have been unavailable. For example, the
   amount of effluent flow in a land application system increases when
   precipitation occurs, while at the same time the net water requirement
   of plants decreases. Therefore extra storage and extra land acreage is
   needed, but the amount required has not been established. Additionally,
   frequent rainfall coupled with high humidity creates an evaporation
   regime in the coastal region that inhibits the efficiency and viability
   of the land application disposal method. The bases of these problems are
   climatological; therefore, this study uses a climatological analysis to
   provide design considerations regarding the capability of this disposal
   method in the coastal region. The availability of long-term digitized
   daily weather data offers the opportunity to test the design of such
   systems by simulating multiple years of operation. Simulation using 30
   years of weather data for a 3800 m(3)/d (1 mgd) plant in the
   southeastern coastal region of the United States shows that the best
   design requires a 256 ha (640 A) application field and a 16 ha (40 A)
   storage pond 3.7 m (12 ft) deep. These specifications provide system
   success ranging from 99\% in 6 months of the year to 90\% in March and
   prevent any failures in 90\% of the years.}},

   TEST DURING START-UP OF AN ANAEROBIC-DIGESTION SYSTEM}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{The specific methanogenic activity test (SMA) was used to determine a
   suitable organic loading rate during the start-up phase of a crossflow
   ultrafiltration membrane anaerobic reactor system (CUMAR). The SMA test
   was immediately carried out after seeding the reactor with sludge taken
   from a municipal wastewater treatment plant digester in order to
   determine the most acceptable initial organic loading rate. The initial
   test results during the first week showed that the acetoclastic capacity
   of the reactor sludge, at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 1 kg
   COD/m(3).d, was found to be low which resulted in a very poor COD
   removal efficiency, i.e. 14\%. Therefore the OLR was maintained at
   approximately 0.7 kg COD/m(3).d in the next two weeks of operation
   resulting in the COD removal efficiency of over 65\% in the effluent.
   Based upon the SMA tests results, the OLRs were either increased or
   decreased in order to improve performance of the system and to achieve
   stable conditions which further resulted in an excellent organic matter
   removal, i.e. over 98\% COD and almost 100\% BOD removal at an OLR of
   over 1 kg COD/m(3).d. At this point the ratio of actual methane

Abstract = {{A wastewater reclamation project involving a pilot-plant study and
   further design and construction of a full scale advanced wastewater
   treatment plant is presented in this paper. A wastewater with a flow of
   8000-10,000 m(3)/d comprising 40\% industrial wastewater from a
   machinery factory and 60\% domestic wastewater from residential area
   with a population of about 50,000 people is treated, and 50\% of the
   treated effluent is directly reused for washing, boiler supply, air
   pollution control, cooling, washroom flushing, landscape irrigation, and
   construction. The severe shortage of water in this area and the
   pollution caused to the river leading to the Zhangze Reservoir
   necessitated this project. The pilot-plant study was conducted to
   provide sound technical information for the final construction of a
   full-scale advanced wastewater treatment plant. The wastewater treatment
   plant {[}with a capital cost of 3.92 million yuans (1 yuan = 0.27 U.S.
   \$)] which employs a two-stage attached growth biological treatment
   process followed by sand filtration and disinfection has been put into
   operation successfully. The planned removal efficiencies of COD,
   turbidity, and total coliforms are achieved by this plant. Economic
   efficiency analysis conducted shows that the net gain of the project is
   248,000 yuans annually.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmid content of activated sludge was evaluated by two different and
   complementary approaches. The first one consisted in the isolation of
   colonies from activated sludge samples, then isolated colonies were
   grown in nutrient broth and the plasmids were extracted from these
   cultures. The plasmid extraction procedure used a commercialized kit and
   the corresponding protocol. By this first approach, 40\% of isolated
   colonies harboring plasmids were found. The second approach was an
   adaptation of the plasmid extraction kit directly on activated sludge
   samples. This direct application required several washing steps of
   sludges samples to avoid plasmid DNA digestion by DNases adsorbed within
   the sludge. This direct and rapid technique was validated in terms of
   reproducibility, specificity for plasmid DNA and losses. It allows the
   isolation of around 1 mu g of plasmid DNA per 10(11) cells in the
   sludge. The two approaches presented in this paper indicated that the
   plasmid content of activated sludge is important and its particular role
   within the wastewater epuration procedure should be investigated,}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to evaluate the role of contact time, pH, chlorine dose
   and temperature on the formation of THMs as result of prechlorination of
   raw river water. THM species and total THMs (TTHMs) concentrations
   progressively increased as the contact time was extended from 30 min up
   to 210 min. In presence of excess chlorine, THM formation proceeds as a
   pseudo first order reaction. Values of the rate constant (K) for CHCl3,
   CHCl2Br and TTHMs approached each other whereas the CHClBr2 attained a
   higher value. The reaction rate of THMs formation increased as the pH
   value of water was increased from 6 to 9. The increase in THMs was not
   directly proportional to the applied chlorine dose. Increase in water
   temperature showed a rather limited effect compared to that reported by
   other investigators.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of a lubricating oil saturated hydrocarbon feed stock, and

   non-toxic nature of the hydrocarbons was attributed to the low aqueous
   solubility. Oxidation resulted in the formation of products with a
   greater solubility, which were sufficiently hydrophobic to be narcotic
   toxicants. The rapid chemical oxidation method may thus provide a
   `'model'' for assessing the toxic potential of unresolved complex
   mixtures (UCMs) in the environment, since it produces compounds similar

Abstract = {{Utilization of chemically precipitated ferrites for water treatment has
   been studied. In acidic media ferrites act as adsorbents of impurities
   contained in untreated water and as desorbents in alkaline media. The
   parameters of sorption such as pH, mixing conditions, concentration and
   type of alkaline agent etc, have been stated. Detailed research has led
   to the technology of water cleaning, which is schematically described.
   The results of the treatment of samples from the river Vltava are
   discussed in comparison with conventional water clarification methods.}},
