Abstract = {{Microbial pathogens are one of the major health risks associated with
   water and wastewaters. Current methods for the detection of pathogenic
   viruses, bacteria, protozoa and helminths tend to be inaccurate, time
   consuming and expensive. As a result, indicator bacteria are commonly
   used to determine the relative risk of faecal contamination and the
   possible presence of pathogens in water and wastewaters. Indicator
   organisms, however, have several disadvantages that make them less than
   ideal for indicating the possible presence of microbial pathogens.
   Consequently methods to directly detect microbial pathogens in water and
   wastewaters are being investigated. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is
   one of the main alternative detection methods being trialed. PCR has
   been shown to be a rapid, highly sensitive and accurate method. It has
   already been used experimentally to detect pathogenic viruses, bacteria
   and protozoa in water and wastewaters. PCR, however, has a number of
   limitations. One such limitation is the generation of false positives
   through the detection of naked nucleic acids, non-viable microorganism,
   or through contamination in the laboratory. Other limitations include
   inhibition by environmental contaminants and difficulty in
   quantification. The potential of PCR for the direct detection of
   microbial pathogens in water and wastewater, as well as the current
   limitations are discussed below. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The chlorination of water containing bromide and natural organic matter
   (NOM) leads to the formation of brominated trihalomethanes (THMs). The
   extent of brominated THM formation depends, inter alin, on the
   bromide:chlorine concentration ratio ({[}Br-]:{[}chlorine]). A reaction
   scheme is proposed from which a simple kinetic model is developed that
   mathematically relates the extent of bromination, and the relative
   abundances of the four THMs, to the {[}Br-]:{[}chlorine] ratio. In the
   scheme, the trihalogenated precursors to THMs are formed by three steps
   each of which substitutes either bromine or chlorine into an activated
   carbon site in the NOM. This leads to six pairs of competing
   bromination:chlorination reactions, whose rate constant ratios
   (k(b):k(c),) have been estimated by using the model to fit THM data
   obtained from the chlorination of 17 waters from New Zealand. The
   individual k(b):k(c) ratios range from 4 to 15. From a plot of the ratio
   of total bromine to total chlorine present in the THMs as a function of
   the {[}Br-]:{[}chlorine] ratio, an apparent overall k(b):k(c) ratio of
   9.1 is obtained.
   Using USEPA cancer potency factors, the model is used to predict the
   relative cancer risk associated with THMs as a function of the
   {[}Br-]:{[}chlorine] ratio. This risk increases steeply to a peak at a
   {[}Br-]:{[}chlorine] ratio of approximately 0.15, then gradually
   decreases to the value associated with bromoform alone. The risk
   associated with THMs may vary considerably through changes in the
   {[}Br-]:{[}chlorine] ratio as the result of natural variation in the
   {[}Br-], or through poor control of chlorine dosing. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Although substantial research effort has been expended towards the
   modeling of nitrification process, optimization and control of
   nitrifying systems, especially using a sequencing batch reactor (SBR)

   using an on-line adaptive optimization algorithm. The algorithm is based
   on the on-line identification of the batch cycle duration and is used
   for the on-line determination of the fraction of switching period to be
   implemented. The performance of the algorithm was tested against a
   simplified nitrification model adopted from the activated sludge model
   No. 2 (ASM2). The convergence of the algorithm to the optimum fraction
   of switching period, as well as its ability to satisfactorily handle
   disturbances in the influent ammonium-nitrogen concentration, is
   demonstrated. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrations of indicator bacteria - faecal coliforms (FC) and faecal
   streptococci (FS) were monitored at stream and water inflow sampling
   sites over a 21 month period within a small upland catchment in north
   Derbyshire, England. Agricultural land-use within the catchment included
   rough, semi-improved and improved pastures for sheep grazing. During its
   passage through the catchment, the stream became significantly
   contaminated by faecal bacteria, suggesting the existence of a
   semi-permanent store of faecal bacteria in catchment soils, combined
   with hydrological transport mechanisms capable of moving bacteria from
   the land to the stream channel. Spatial changes in the bacterial quality
   of streamwater could be explained by the influence of a number of
   monitored water inflows to the stream, although a clear and consistent
   relationship between the bacterial quality of catchment waters and the
   intensity of adjacent agricultural land-use was not apparent. This is
   explained in terms of a trade-off between practices which allow land-use
   intensification and a consequent reduction in the potential for
   bacterial survival in soils and efficient hydrological transport via
   surface-water flows. A consistent seasonal pattern of bacterial
   concentration change was observed, with the highest concentrations
   occurring during summer months as stocking density increased and the
   bacterial land store recovered from high precipitation-related outputs
   during the winter. The extent of faecal bacterial contamination of the
   stream, particularly during summer months, may constitute a real health
   risk to recreational cavers using parts of the limestone karst system
   into which the stream drains. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Dispersed oil drops need to be reduced to very low concentrations before
   water can be discharged into the environment. Conventional equipment to
   achieve separation includes: settling tanks, hydrocyclones and
   centrifuges. However, these devices are not effective at removing oil
   drops with small diameters and filtration may have to be used. The
   rejection (retention by the filter) of oil drops dispersed in water by
   an asymmetric surface filter has been measured. The filter medium has
   conical pores that pass from the filtering side to the filtrate side
   with no internal tortuosity. The filter tube was cylindrical with a
   central rod supporting an annular helix of 14 mm pitch and the oil in
   water emulsion was pumped through the tube giving rise to a retentate
   (concentrated suspension of oil in water) and a permeate (filtrate
   almost clear of oil). The oil emulsion was stabilised by polyvinyl
   alcohol at a concentration of 0.2 g/l to give drops of between 1-40 mu m
   in diameter. This is the emulsion size associated with produced water
   from oil reservoirs. The percentage retention of the oil drops by the
   filter, at a given drop diameter, was determined using a Coulter
   Multisizer in conjunction with a metal tracer added to the oil. The
   filters were tested at a fixed rate of permeate flux and gave similar
   rejections whether the more open end or tighter end of the pores faced
   the challenge emulsion. The latter case required an increase in the
   transmembrane pressure from 0.18 to 0.2 bar, this pressure remained
   constant throughout the experiments. Thus, the microfiltrations were
   performed under conditions of constant flux and pressure. Using a feed
   of larger oil drops significantly changed the rejection: a coarse
   emulsion had a rejection of 80\% at 2 mu m whilst a finer emulsion gave
   a 50\% cut-off at 5 mu m. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The objective was to provide selection criteria for substrates that
   would enhance phosphate removal from waste water in a constructed
   wetland system (subsurface horizontal how). Measured properties of seven
   substrates (bauxite, shale, burnt oil shale, limestone, zeolite, light
   expanded clay aggregates (LECA) and fly ash) were: pH, cation exchange
   capacity (CEC), hydraulic conductivity, porosity, specific surface area,
   particle size distribution and phosphate (P) adsorption capacity. Fly
   ash and shale had the highest P adsorption values, followed by bauxite,
   limestone and LECA. Longer-term experiments in which synthetic waste
   water was passed over shale and bauxite gave maximum P uptake values of
   730 and 355 mg P kg(-1) respectively. X-ray fluorescence measurements
   showed that substantial precipitation of P had occurred on the shale
   surfaces. On the basis of these measurements it was concluded that, of
   the seven materials examined, shale had the best combination of
   properties as a substrate for constructed wetland systems (CWS). (C)

Abstract = {{Since water is the main contamination arrow in the underground, it is
   necessary to get good indicators to be able to detect pollution sources
   as old wastes dump. This is also useful for the monitoring of
   contaminated sites in time and space. The new analytical method high
   resolution-ICP-MS is an opportunity tb improve the characterization of
   water by analyzing mineral traces at very low level (<0.1 mu g/l).
   Numerous site descriptions (41 sites) and statistical approach of
   collected samples (223 samples), have shown that the use of the
   inorganic trace elements is helpful for the detection and/or the survey
   of contaminated sites. Another interesting result shows specific
   indicators for hazardous waste. This method can be used beside organic
   compound analyses, which are heavier and expensive in practice. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Ferron reagent and FTIR spectroscopy were used for the identification
   and characterization of the aluminum species formed during
   dephosphorization of simulated wastewater with and without organic
   matter. Evidence from FTIR spectroscopy showed the formation of aluminum
   hydroxyphosphate, hydroxy-Al-tannate and aluminum complexes containing
   both phosphorus and tannic acid. The surface reactivity of the solid
   products is proportional to the rate of reaction with ferron. The
   measured reactivities indicate that aluminum solid species with
   different surface properties were formed depending on solution
   components and method of precipitation. Tannic acid was found to inhibit
   phosphorus removal and the extent of inhibition increased with
   increasing concentration. When prehydrolyzed aluminum is exposed to
   tannic acid, the organic matter forms a coating on the surface of the
   inorganic solid during the aging process. Coprecipitation of aluminum,
   phosphate and tannic acid, which is synonymous with the addition of alum
   before or in the aerator, produces some soluble complex and some
   hydroxy-Al-phosphate-tannate complex, in the form of solid with very
   small particle size. This system gives high residual aluminum. The
   results suggest that it is advantageous to add at least a portion of the
   alum at the exit of the aerator. This enhances phosphorus removal by
   coprecipitation under conditions where the concentration of organic
   matter is relatively low and enhances removal of organic matter by
   postprecipitation onto the recycled sludge in the aerator. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Depth profiles of geosmin, of which a dissolved and particle-bound
   fraction was distinguished, were analyzed monthly in a seasonal study in
   a stratified mesotrophic prealpine lake (Lake Zurich). Remarkable
   seasonal and spatial differences in the total amounts and ratios between
   both fractions were observed. Equally low concentrations of dissolved
   and particle-bound geosmin were found in the winter season during
   turnover conditions (maximum total geosmin 3.1 ng l(-1)). In the
   clear-water period the dissolved fraction of geosmin increased
   dramatically (93\% of the total) whereas the particle-bound geosmin
   showed. only minor changes. In the autumn and first part of the winter
   surface films contributed essentially to the particle-bound fraction of
   geosmin exhibiting maximum concentrations of 21 ng l(-1). Possible
   producers of geosmin in Lake Zurich (Aphanizomenon, Oscillatoria,
   Planktothrix) were cultivated and their content of geosmin was
   determined. Feeding experiments with Daphnia and Simocephalus simulating
   the phenomenon of the clear-water period clearly demonstrated that
   grazing can be regarded as a major mechanism for the Liberation of
   geosmin from particles. The mean degradation rate in a microcosm
   experiment caused by pelagic bacteria was 3.1 ng l(-1) d(-1); this rate
   was high enough to explain the concentration differences between
   consecutive sampling dates. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Water supply networks are generally modelled for a day or longer time
   period. Under most circumstances, it is normal to omit the dispersive
   movement of chlorine and to assume that the convective transport
   dominates over dispersion. However, during night time operations the
   velocities are significantly decreased. This radical change in the
   velocity may therefore lead to the following question: can the available
   convection based quality models predict the chlorine concentrations
   accurately in time and space? An improved water quality model implies
   accurate estimation of concentrations at nodes in time and space at all
   levels of branching. To enhance the utility of water quality models
   dispersion may also be taken into account. In this paper, an effort that
   Led to the development of an unsteady 2-D convective-dispersive model is
   presented, and the model output is compared with the experimental
   results. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the results of an experimental investigation
   designed to analyze the interaction between near wall coherent
   structures (or burst) and bedload transport in an open channel flow.
   Laser doppler velocimetry (LDV) measurements of the instantaneous
   velocity near the wall were coupled with real time measurements of sand
   particle trajectories on the bottom of an hydraulic flume. We will first
   give a description of the bursting phenomenon and we will present the
   experimental design. Then, we will give some details about the specific
   signal processing techniques we used in this work to detect coherent
   structures on the velocity signal. The third part of this paper will
   present our results. We will show that the period between two
   consecutive displacements of a solid particle can be compared to the
   mean period between two consecutive ejections. This would suggest that
   these structures are involved in bedload transport. For small
   displacements, the time distribution between two consecutive movements
   shows two modes. One would be associated to particles whose mean deposit
   time corresponds to the ejection period, the second would be associated
   to particles whose mean deposit time is close to the sweep period. We
   made the assumption that there exist two transport modes at the wall:
   the dominant one was transport by ejections, but sweeps Mn be involved
   in the removal of particles whose friction coefficient with the wall is
   high. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An abiotic method for oxidative PCP degradation in soil under

   impact on PCP degradation in a soil contaminated with wood preserving
   chemicals. The results showed that heme and peroxide could efficiently
   degrade PCP and crystal violet in a short period of time in either
   liquid or unsaturated soil systems. In soil, three control runs showed
   little degradation of PCP, but treatments with heme and peroxide showed
   a maximum of 13\% mineralization of PCP. Heme and peroxide concentration
   were the two most important factors in improving degradation of PCP in
   soil. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous water and air backwashing has been established as the most
   effective cleaning regime for rapid gravity Biters. For certain air and
   water wash rates the bed can reach a state termed
   ``collapse-pulsing{''}. This has been identified as the optimum cleaning
   regime for simultaneous air and water backwashing. An empirical formula
   exists to predict collapse-pursing. this is given in terms of the water,
   air and minimum fluidising velocities. However, no suitable method
   exists to confirm that the collapse-pulsing condition has been achieved,
   other than by visually subjective observations of the bed. Visual
   observation is not always physically possible or practical on industrial
   size filters. This study examines pressure fluctuations, taken at
   various heights in the bed, and their associated frequency spectra as a
   means of identifying the collapse-pulsing condition. Preliminary results
   show that, particularly in the upper sections of the bed, distinct peaks
   occurs in the frequency spectrum at collapse-pulsing. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This work concerns mass transport in anaerobic biofilms, formed under
   upflow liquid velocities similar to the prevailing conditions in
   anaerobic reactors used for wastewater treatment. During biofilm
   formation under liquid velocities of 1.5 and 13.2 m/h, internal mass
   transfer coefficients were routinely measured. Mass transfer
   coefficients attained pseudo steady-state values between 2-4x10(-3) m/h,
   no dependence being observed between bulk flow and internal mass
   transport rates. However. a transient Variation in the liquid velocity
   from 1.5 up to 13.2 m/h, imposed after the biofilm had reached the
   steady-state, increased the internal mass transport by 20\% on average.
   This result suggests that periodic changes in the bulk fluid velocity
   can be used as a tool to increase the transport of soluble substrates
   inside already formed biofilms, although the effect seems to be limited.

Abstract = {{The principle of the Rotating Biological Contactor (RBC) was originated
   in the early part of the century and today there are many thousands of
   units operating world wide. However, the RBC has been plagued with
   mechanical deficiencies since its conception. This paper presents a
   brief insight into some of the major mechanical defects associated with
   RBCs. These findings have been accumulated over the past three years
   during a mechanical design audit, and encompass over two hundred and
   sixty RBC units visited operating on site. The reasons for mechanical
   failures are attributed to poor engineering design, low frequency
   corrosion fatigue and microbiologically influenced corrosion; evidence
   supporting these claims is presented. Having the benefit of a thorough
   understanding of the mechanisms and reasons for mechanical failure, a
   new approach to designing RBCs is encouraged. This has resulted in a new
   generation of RBC designs with a guaranteed operational life of twenty
   years. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Led. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Transport studies of Escherichia coli were performed in laboratory
   columns over a period of 15 months. The effects of the filter media
   properties, effective grain size, specific surface area, pH and cation
   exchange capacity were examined for loading rates of 25 mm and 50 mm/day
   applied as 8 doses per day. Distilled water and two solutions of ionic
   strength 0.00725 and 0.097 M were applied to the columns. Physical
   factors were found to be the most important for the removal of E. coli.
   Reduced grain size, hydraulic loading rate and increased specific
   surface area of the grains significantly reduced transport of E. coli.
   Chemical factors such as pH, cation exchange capacity and wastewater
   ionic strength showed less significant effects. The results indicate
   that the chemical factors in biological wastewater filters have a minor
   influence on the removal of E. coli after a stabilizing period of three
   months. Minimum hydraulic retention time (time required for 10\%
   breakthrough of a conservative tracer) was found to be the most relevant
   parameter for predicting bacterial removal in unsaturated filter
   systems. Correlation between observed data and a first order removal
   model, based on minimum retention time, was 0.70. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The process performance and metabolic rates of several samples of
   activated sludge which were dosed with micronutrient supplements have
   been compared in this study. Six trace metals and six vitamins were used
   as chemical additives dosed into the mixed liquor. It was confirmed
   experimentally that a wastewater stream from a chemicals manufacturing
   plant did not contain a sufficient supply of micronutrients for
   efficient biological treatment. This was concluded from the observation
   that control sludge batches (receiving no micronutrient supplements)
   attained an average chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate of 1.94 kg
   COD kg MLSS-1 d(-1). Dosing micronutrients into the mixed liquor
   produced COD removal rates of up to 2.24 kg COD kg MLSS-1 d(-1). Some of
   the supplements increased the metabolic rate of the sludge while some
   decreased it, indicating a range of stimulatory and inhibitory effects.
   Complex interactions between micronutrients that were dosed
   simultaneously were evident. Several positive effects led to the
   conclusion that micronutrient supplements have the potential to optimise
   the process performance of activated sludge plants treating industrial
   wastewater. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study is concerned with the changes in the rate of chloroform
   formation during the reactions of groundwater natural organic matter
   (NOM) and sodium hypochlorite caused by different drinking water
   treatments schemes: coagulation with FeCl3, Al-2(SO4)(3) and
   polyaluminum chloride (PACl), filtration of the raw water through
   granular activated carbon (GAC) and filtration through the columns
   filled with strong base macroporous ion-exchange resins (Purolite A501P
   and A500P) with and without pretreatment by coagulation process. It was
   found that the change of the concentration of chloroform, within 2 h and
   c(Cl-2) = 100 mg l(-1), can be described by a kinetic equation of the
   form {[}CHCl3] = a + bt(c). On the basis of this equation rates of the
   reaction were calculated. All processes applied decreased the rate of
   chloroform formation (process of coagulation moderately decreased the
   rate of reactions, while GAC adsorption caused dramatically drop of the
   rate). Also, it was found that the resins have had a higher affinity
   towards slow-reacting chloroform precursors.
   The value of the chloroform formation potential was conventionally
   determined after a 7-day reaction at pH 7. In addition, the same
   parameter was estimated with a satisfactory deviation for raw water and
   for treated water on the basis of the kinetic constant (k) or by
   determining the chloroform concentration after 2 h (ChFP(2)) under
   rigourous chlorination conditions at pH 8.4. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Biological denitrification was investigated in an attached growth
   reactor system using several growth media, denitrifying cultures and
   natural gas (95\% methane) as a carbon source. In order to establish a
   baseline of operation, initial experiments were conducted with a bed of
   2-3 mm sand and methanol as a carbon source using a methylotrophic
   denitrifying culture and then the system was compared with natural gas
   using various methane utilising cultures. Compared to methanol,
   performance with methane was considerably lower. In order to improve
   denitrification with methane a plastic medium (Etapak, surface area 200
   m(2)/m(3)) was placed above the sand bed (which increased the surface
   area for bacteria growth in the upper part of the bed), and a new
   methanotrophic mixed culture (NCIMB-code 11085) was introduced to the
   system. This combination resulted in a 27\% higher denitrification
   efficiency. Experiments were continued by systematically varying the
   operating conditions to obtain highest denitrification using methane gas
   and replacing the Etapak media with different plastic media of higher
   surface area, but keeping the NCIMB culture unchanged. Other media
   tested were Pall-rings (surface area 319 m(2)/m(3)), IF-spacers (surface
   area 500 m(2)/m(3)) and granular activated carbon (GAC-code: Norit PK
   1-3). Best results were obtained with IF-spacers which, surprisingly,
   are designed for use in the concrete industry rather than as a bacterial
   support medium. These produced nitrate removal efficiencies of up to
   93\% at 0.6 m/h or 55\% at 1.6 m/h water filtration rates. Run times of
   10 days or more to a limiting headless of about 1.0 m, were usually
   achieved before ``bumping{''} or back-washing to reduce headless.
   Effluent turbidities were generally below 1.0 NTU. Tests for bacteria
   present with GAC media and COD removal with IP spacers were also carried
   out. Results are discussed with operational conditions and
   denitrification efficiencies achieved. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{This research on PCB impact in stream sediments seeks to integrate
   ecological perspectives into the traditional physicochemical approach to
   hydrophobic organic chemical (HOC) study. This paper presents the design
   and use of a novel laboratory stream system with a natural sediment
   substrate to study the response of a periphytic biolayer to low level
   PCB exposure over a 2-month rime period. The results demonstrate that
   the laboratory stream system is a powerful tool to evaluate the
   biological impact and fate of PCBs. The results of biological monitoring
   demonstrated that the structure of the periphytic community changed with
   exposure to PCBs. The periphytic community shifted from one dominated
   solely by a diverse array of diatom taxa to one co-dominated by fewer
   types of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) and a single diatom taxon,
   This suggests that the structural changes in the community are a good
   early bioindicator of contamination, whereas periphyton biomass
   (chlorophyll a and biovolume), cell number or the presence/absence of
   particular species are not sensitive measures for assessing the
   ecological impact of pollutants. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{It has been proposed that the accumulation of PCBs by aquatic organisms
   is physicochemical process that is governed by the equilibrium
   partitioning of PCBs between the organisms and the ambient water. This
   approach focuses primarily on the hydrophobicity of PCBs, while
   neglecting the biological impacts of PCB accumulation and possible
   differences in species-specific response. Furthermore, it does not
   reflect the complex mechanistic aspects of PCB accumulation. Current
   modeling, while focusing on accumulation via contaminated Food, has been
   for large lake systems and is not appropriate for lower trophic organism
   interactions. The objective of this research was to evaluate the
   ecotoxicological fate of PCBs in a laboratory stream system and to
   determine if species-specific differences in the accumulation and toxic
   effects of PCBs existed. Bench scale experiments were conducted to
   determine kinetic and equilibrium parameters measuring algal uptake of
   PCB, and these results were used to explain the periphytic response to
   low level PCB exposure in the laboratory stream system. The results
   revealed that the accumulation rate, accumulation capacity and toxicity
   of PCBs differed for the species tested. The observation of PCB fate in
   the laboratory stream system indicated that PCB volatilization, sediment
   adsorption and periphyton bioaccumulation were the major pathways of PCB
   fate. The periphytic biolayer was the significant sink for PCB

   was one order of magnitude greater than that of sediments on a TOC

   illustrates that equilibrium partitioning models are not very accurate

Abstract = {{A study based on information from the scientific literature was carried
   out to identify the key processes which determine the initial
   radiocaesium activity concentration and its rate of removal in 16
   different European lakes after the Chernobyl accident. Analysis and
   modelling of these data showed that a simple model, incorporating only
   dilution, lake hushing and settling of suspended particles, can explain
   97\% of the variation in initial activity concentrations in lakewater
   and 79\% of the variation in Cs-137 removal rates. On the basis of
   currently available data, incorporating a simple model for removal of
   activity by diffusion across the sediment-water interface did not
   improve model predictive power. It is shown that direct diffusion was of
   less importance in determining radiocaesium removal rates than particle
   settling. The potassium concentration of the lakewater was found to have
   a significant, negative, covariance with Cs-137 removal rates. The
   relationship between {[}K+] and removal rate is shown to be
   quantitatively consistent with previous studies on the binding mechanism
   of Cs-137 to particulates. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Two tertiary lagoons at Holmwood Sewage Treatment Works in the United
   Kingdom were sampled over a 1 year period. Each lagoon is approximately
   39 x 28 m, receives domestic wastewater only, and serves approximately
   2000 people. The aim of the work is to gain a greater understanding of
   the performance of the lagoon with respect to a number of chemical,
   biological and physical parameters. Samples were analysed for E. coli,
   enterococci, total coliforms, BOD, COD, suspended solids, ammoniacal
   nitrogen, nitrite, nitrate, total oxidised nitrogen and soluble
   phosphate. Occasional samples were also analysed for Cryptosporidium,
   Giardia and enteroviruses. Cusum charts were used to analyse the
   cumulative variations that were seen for the parameters being
   investigated, and had the advantage of emphasising their distinct
   seasonal trends. Although good percentage removals were seen, there was
   a lack of consistency in performance for all parameters over the year.
   No ammonia or phosphorus removal was found, although limited
   nitrification does appear to occur. None of the bacterial criteria for
   the WHO guidelines on wastewater reuse or the EC directive on bathing
   water were reached. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring data over a year showed that the performance of a tertiary
   lagoon system in the United Kingdom was very variable. Distinct seasonal
   patterns were seen for all the determinands. Tracer studies and profile
   sampling of one of the lagoons were carried out in order to investigate
   the factors affecting performance. The tracer studies, using sodium
   fluoride, indicated that the hydraulic regime was dispersed plug Row.
   The mean retention time was found to be 26 h, but the peak in tracer
   concentration occurred after 12 h, showing significant short-circuiting.
   During the profile sampling, the pH, temperature, DO and conductivity
   were measured down through the lagoon at 16 positions and four depths.
   E. coli, enterococci and total coliform numbers were measured in samples
   taken from the surface and the base of the lagoon. The results showed
   temperature decreased down through the lagoon, but the other parameters
   increased with depth, indicating that the short-circuiting was caused by
   the cooler influent sinking to the base of the lagoon. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The bioavailability of sorbed naphthalene and 1-naphthol was determined
   for two sandy soils differing primarily in organic matter content.
   Different sorption conditions were maintained over a 2 d equilibration
   period to estimate the extent that oxidative coupling contributed to the
   strong binding of these compounds to the soils. Weakly sorbed test
   compounds were removed through 50 successive water extractions and the
   bioavailability of the remaining sorbed fraction was determined by the
   addition of aerobic, test compound-degrading bacteria to soil slurry
   reactors. Soils were then incubated under aerobic conditions for 90 d.
   Biodegradation rates were determined by monitoring (CO2)-C-14 evolution
   and the soil-associated non-mineralized residue was measured by
   combustion of the soil after the 90 d period. Successive water
   extractions removed 38.7-64.3\% of 1-naphthol and 62.4\% of naphthalene
   from the high NOM soil and 67.2-82.9\% of 1-naphthol and 72.3\% of
   naphthalene from the low NOM soil. Of the remaining material, 5.7-16.9\%
   of 1-naphthol and 73.3\% of naphthalene in the high NOM soil and
   3.7-6.0\% of 1-naphthol and 34.2\% of naphthalene in the low NOM soil
   was mineralized after 90 d. In contrast, > 85\% of both test compounds
   were mineralized in the absence of soil. Experimental evidence suggests
   that oxidative coupling reactions limited the bioavailability of
   1-naphthol in both soils. Naphthalene bioavailability was not greatly
   limited because it can not directly participate in strong binding
   reactions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{On April 25, 1998, a spill at the Los Frailes mine in southern Spain
   resulted in a very high input of metals (including: Ag, As, Cd, Cu, Fe,
   Pb, Tl and Zn) into the river Guadiamar. Calculations indicate that the
   discharges into the Guadiamar of Cu (5100 t), Pb (24,700 t), Zn (26,200
   t) and Ag (138 t, based on mud only) were higher than the annual
   production by the Los Frailes mine for Ag and Pb, and ca. two times less
   for Cu and Zn. For many metals, the increase in concentration in the
   affected river (Guadiamar), 2 days after the initial discharge, was by
   several orders of magnitude. However, 6 months after the incident, no
   evidence of the spill could be observed in the plume of the river
   (Guadalquivir) which discharged the mine waters into the coastal waters
   of the Gulf of Cadiz. This observation can possibly be explained by low
   rainfall, natural metal removal processes in the river and estuarine
   environments and by human interventions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{A fixed bed reactor filled with calcite particles (mean strokes
   diameter, 0.20 mm) was constructed and the reactor was used to treat
   synthetic wastewater containing HF, NaF, NH4F or Na2SiF6 under various
   conditions. Calcium ions (Ca2+) were found to exist in the treated
   effluent and the molar Ca2+ concentration ({[}Ca2+]) was related to the
   molar ratio of H+ to F- ({[}H+](0)/{[}F-](0)) in influent as
   log(10){[}Ca2+] = 0.020{[}H+](0)/{[}F-](0)-4.24. The effluent F-
   concentration was determined by the concentration of effluent Ca2+ as
   {[}F-](2){[}Ca2+](0.94) = 3.98 x 10(-10) under an SV of 1.0 to 5.0 h(-1)
   and 25 degrees C. This equation was similar with that of the solubility
   product of CaF2 and could be applied to wastewaters containing HF, NaF,
   NH4F or Na2SiF6 under an influent F- concentration ranging from 25 to
   3000 mg l(-1). The effluent F- was also found to be related to effluent
   pH as log(10){[}F-] = 0.51 pH-2.91. The effluent F- was about 6 mg l(-1)
   at an effluent Ca2+ of 80 mg l(-1) or effluent pH of 6.8 under the above
   conditions. The effluent F- increased from 6 to 12 mg l(-1) and
   effective calcite conversion rate decreased from ca. 60 to 40\% when SV
   was increased from 1.6 to 16.0 h(-1) at a {[}H+](0)/{[}F-](0) of 0.75.
   Significant increase of effluent F- as well as decrease of effective
   calcite conversion rate was observed when reaction temperature was
   decreased to 8.5 degrees C at an SV of 7 h(-1) and {[}H+](0)/{[}F-](0)
   of 0.75. The performance of the reactor was affected by the existence of
   SO42- to some extent and significantly inhibited by PO43-. A molar ratio
   of PO43- to F- higher than 0.05 stopped F- removal at a PO43- of 15 mg
   l(-1). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Precipitate-flotation of fluoride-containing wastewater from a
   semiconductor manufacturer was investigated. The process involves the
   addition of calcium chloride to generate precipitate and the subsequent
   removal of calcium fluoride (CaF2). Results from dispersed air flotation
   (DiAF) experiments indicate that through the adjustment of molar ratio
   of calcium and fluoride ({[}Ca2+]/{[}F-]) and pH values, the residual
   fluoride concentration of lower than 10 mg/L in the effluent could be
   obtained. The concentration of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
   significantly affected the removal efficiency of CaF2. Flotation
   reaction was not affected by pH. Flotation efficiency decreased with
   increasing ionic strength and in the presence of sulfate. However, the
   depressed flotation could be improved by increasing SDS concentration.

Abstract = {{The interaction between silicic acid (H4SiO4) and ferrihydrite involves
   both adsorption and polymerisation, and has a significant effect on the
   adsorption of anionic species such as the oxyanions of arsenic. Using
   the diffuse layer model (DLM), the adsorption constants for H4SiO4,
   As(V), and As(III) adsorption onto ferrihydrite have been determined
   from experimental adsorption data. Silicic acid could be considered to
   adsorb as a monomer when the total Si to Fe mole ratio (Si-(T)/Fe) was <
   0.1, and the inhibitory effect of H4SiO4 on As(III) and As(V) adsorption
   could be accurately modelled using the DLM. At higher Si-(T)/Fe ratios,
   H4SiO4 polymerisation on the ferrihydrite surface appeared to become
   increasingly important. However, even when Si-(T)/Fe = 1.8 and there
   would have been significant H4SiO4 polymerisation, the DLM continued to
   predict almost all of the observed effect of H4SiO4 on As(III) and As(V)
   adsorption while taking only H4SiO4 adsorption into account. This
   suggests that H4SiO4 adsorption inhibits Pls adsorption to a greater
   degree than H4SiO4 polymerisation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This article describes the process of determining the water quality
   index (WQI) for Dalmatian County waters as well as the results of the
   application of the index for water evaluation in Dalmatia (Southern
   Croatia) for a three year period (1995, 1996; 1997). WQI includes the
   following nine parameters: temperature, mineralization, corrosion
   coefficient, K = (Cl + SO4)/HCO3, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen
   demand, total nitrogen, protein N, total phosphorus and total coliform
   bacteria (MPN coli/100 ml) for which concentrations C-80 are calculated.
   After completing the nine parameters the results of C80 were recorded
   and transferred to the score table to obtain the q-value. The q-value
   used is an attempt to quantify environmental factors which would
   otherwise be qualitative. For each parameter the q-value was multiplied
   by a weighting factor based upon the relative significance of the
   parameter. The nine resulting Values were then added to arrive at an
   overall WQI.
   The WQI is obtained so that the water quality evaluation (WQE) can be
   divided by water quality evaluation (WQE)(MAC) which satisfies the
   maximum admissible concentration (MAC) of first class water. It includes
   both underground and surface water, which can be used in its natural
   state or after being disinfected for drinking water.
   Spring and river waters in Dalmatia which contain low sulphate and
   chloride concentrations are of high sanitary quality. This duality can
   be estimated by the WQI (quality index), which varies around 1.
   The increase of sulphate as well as chloride in springs, rivers and
   underground waters decreases the WQI value; in fact, it causes
   deterioration of the water quality according to the established standard
   for drinking water. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The sulfate reducing bacterium, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans can initiate
   uranium precipitation from solution via direct enzymatic reduction.
   Additionally, separation of heavy metals from solution can occur via
   indirect sulfide-mediated precipitation. This study was conducted to
   evaluate the influence of anions (sulfate, nitrate), heavy metals (zinc,
   nickel and copper) and organics (acetate, malonate, oxalate and citrate)
   on the enzymatic reduction of U(VI) by this bacterium. Furthermore,
   methods were evaluated to selectively precipitate uranium or heavy
   metals from test solutions. Selective precipitation can significantly
   lower disposal costs by reducing the volume of mixed-waste sludge
   produced during treatment. Results indicated that sulfate/nitrate
   concentrations up to 5000 mg/l did not appreciably interfere with U(VI)
   reduction, however, anion levels greater than 10,000 mg/l significantly
   slowed the rate of U(VI) reduction. U(VI) was readily reduced by the
   bacterium when 10 mg/l of Zn or Ni was present, but Cu inhibited uranium
   reduction. U(VI) was reduced rapidly in the presence of a monodentate
   organic ligand (acetate) whereas reduction was slower in the presence of
   multidentate ligands. Initial results from selective precipitation
   experiments indicated two potential treatment approaches for isolating
   either uranium or the test heavy metals using D. desulfuricans. The
   first method involved free energy differences for U(VI) and sulfate
   reduction, while the second method involved complexation of reduced
   uranium by a chelator during metal-sulfide precipitation. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{A previously derived metabolically structured model for the biological
   aerobic and anoxic phosphorus removal was combined with the ASM no. 1
   and tested in its capacity to describe a full scale biological nitrogen
   and phosphorus removal WWTP. The sensitivity of the effluent
   concentrations and the sludge production towards the stoichiometric and
   kinetic coefficients, the influent composition, the set-up of the
   hydraulic model and the flows of air, mixed liquor and return sludge was
   analysed. This showed that besides a limited number of model parameters
   (12\%) the influent characterisation influenced the model output
   significant. For calibration of the model only 3 out of the 60 default
   parameters together with the unknown air input needed to be changed
   approximately 40\% to describe the measurements of soluble components at
   different places in the full scale WWTP as a function of time. The
   choice of parameters to calibrate was done on the basis of process and
   model knowledge rather then on the sensitivity analysis. For the

Abstract = {{The present work describes the development and validation of an
   artificial neural network (ANN) for the purpose of estimating inorganic
   and total nitrogen concentrations. The ANN approach has been developed
   and tested using 927 nonpoint source watersheds studied for
   relationships between macro-drainage area characteristics and nutrient
   revels in streams. The ANN had eight independent input variables of
   watershed parameters (five on land use features, mean annual
   precipitation, animal unit density and mean stream how) and two
   dependent output Variables (total and inorganic nitrogen concentrations
   in the stream). The predictive quality of ANN models was judged with
   ``hold-out{''} validation procedures. After ANN learning with the
   training set of data, we obtained a correlation coefficient, of about
   0.85 in the testing set. Thus, ANNs are capable of learning the
   relationships between drainage area characteristics and nitrogen levels
   in streams, and show a high ability to predict from the new data set. On
   the basis of the sensitivity analyses we established the relationship
   between nitrogen concentration and the eight environmental variables.

Abstract = {{Spatial and temporal controls on major ion stream water chemistry are
   assessed using hydrochemical survey data for Wales and the West
   Midlands, and time-series data from the intensively studied Plynlimon
   catchment (mid-Wales). Spatial variations in stream water chemical
   composition are interpreted in relation to the environmental chemistry
   of the major ions and controls such as bedrock geology, land-use,
   anthropogenic activities and atmospheric inputs. Piper diagrams are used
   to illustrate compositional variation, allowing comparison to be made
   between samples of widely varying Total Dissolved Solids (TDS). Spatial
   and temporal data sets are overlaid on Piper plots to determine the
   relative importance of these two factors in controlling major ion
   chemistry. Bedrock geology, atmospheric input and land-use can
   satisfactorily explain compositional variation in the spatial data set.
   Combined analysis of the spatial and temporal data sets indicated that
   the variation in cation composition at the Plynlimon site is
   considerably more constrained than that on the corresponding anion
   diagram. Time-series data sets for sites of different bedrock geology
   and at a range of distances from sources of marine derived solute inputs
   are necessary for further investigation of the relative importance of
   temporal and spatial controls on major ion stream water chemistry. (C)

Abstract = {{Stream water chemical composition, which in many systems represents the
   integration of weathering throughout the catchment, has been used to
   predict the stability and degree of saturation with respect to a range
   of minerals, based on the assumption of a pure closed system, and in the
   case of alumino-silicates, the hydrolysis reaction of a primary mineral
   phase. The distributions of predicted mineral stability and saturation
   have been mapped for Wales, the Welsh borders and part of the West
   Midlands. The incorporation of monitoring data from a site-specific
   study (Plynlimon, mid-Wales) has been used to interpret the significance
   of factors such as seasonality and hydrological regime on mineral
   stability and solubility. The derived maps can be used to identify: (i)
   regions in which streams are most susceptible to freshwater
   acidification and (ii) local variations in bedrock geochemistry, such as
   calcite mineralisation, which cannot be identified by conventional field
   mapping. (C) 1999 NERC. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail rights

Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Raw sludge was pre-fermented in a pilot plant to examine the potential
   for short-chain fatty acids production in Swiss municipal waste-water
   treatment plants. The significance of both batch and continuous
   fermentation in sludge thickeners depends strongly on the efficiency of
   elutriating the Fermentation products. Elutriating the pre-fermented
   sludge with additional water means diluting the dissolved products. To
   describe the efficiency of elutriation, the settling property of
   pre-fermented sludge was therefore examined. Next to dissolved products
   such as short-chain fatty acids, NH4 and PO4 the elutriant contains
   suspended solids. Elutriation of non-sedimentable solids rapidly
   increases the thickening of the fermented sludge. This improved
   thickening of the sludge is thus an important advantage in addition to
   the first of all wished short-chain fatty acid production in a sludge
   thickener operated as a pre-fermenter for enhanced nutrient removal in
   the activated sludge system. The optimized operation of the sludge
   thickeners in the Zurich-Werdhoelzli WWTP is described as an example.
   The disserved fermentation products in common thickeners have the
   potential to denitrify an additional 2 g NO3-N m(-3), which represents

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Commercial dyes are not uniformly susceptible to microbial attack in
   conventional aerobic treatment because of their unique and stable
   chemical structures. Three synthetic dyes with typical chromophores
   (anthraquinone, azo and indigo) were decolorized by a white-rot fungus
   Trametes versicolor. The responsible enzyme for dye decomposition was
   laccase, an extracellular oxidase released by the fungus under the
   conditions of slow growth or in its stationary phase. The mechanism of
   laccase-catalyzed dye decomposition, however, was different depending on
   dye structures. Anthraquinone dye was an enzyme substrate that was
   directly oxidized by laccase while decolorization of azo and indigo dyes
   involved some small molecule (< 8 kDa) metabolites. It was demonstrated
   that azo and indigo dyes were not the substrates of laccase and the
   small molecule metabolites mediated the interaction between the dyes and
   the enzyme. The decolorization rate of the nonsubstrate dyes was
   actually limited by the concentration of mediating compounds rather than
   laccase activity in the solutions. Some synthetic compounds such as
   2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylthiazoline-6-sulfonate) or ABTS and anthraquinone
   dye could also mediate the decolorization of azo and indigo dyes. The
   mediating function of ABTS and anthraquinone dye was quantitatively
   compared in the decomposition of two nonsubstrate dyes. This fact
   implies that the laccase-substrate dyes in an industrial effluent can
   promote the decolorization of those nonsubstrate dyes. Effluent
   decolorization, therefore, may not be limited by the small molecule
   metabolites which are not produced in large amount by fungus in most
   industrial effluents. A laccase-catalyzed and mediator-involved dye
   degradation mechanism is proposed For further kinetic studies. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{In order to study the impact on the river Seine of the waste water
   effluents from the city of Paris and its suburbs, a detailed
   characterisation was made of both raw and treated effluents from the
   three main treatment plants in this area which differ both in size and
   type of treatment. The waste water samples were subjected to analyses of
   the following pools of carbon: dissolved organic carbon (DOC),
   particulate organic carbon (POC), biodegradable fractions of DOC (BDOC)
   and of POC (BPOC), the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Inorganic and
   organic forms of nitrogen and phosphorous, total bacterial biomass and
   nitrifying bacterial biomass were also investigated in parallel. On the
   basis of the results of the analysis performed, a specific load per
   inhabitant and per day (expressed in g inh(-1) d(-1)) for raw and the
   different types of treated waste water was calculated for each variable
   considered in this study. For raw water, the specific loads of TOC
   ranged between 26.4 and 28.3 g C inh(-1) d(-1) with particulate organic
   matter constituting the main part (70-76\%) and the biodegradable
   fraction representing between 60 and 75\%. Concerning micro-organisms,
   the average specific load of total bacteria was around 2 g C of biomass
   inh(-1) d(-1), the nitrifying biomass represented 0.3-2.5\% of the total
   bacterial biomass. Depending on the type of treatment, the specific load
   of TOC in treated water ranged between 3 and 10.8 g C inh(-1) d(-1), it
   corresponded to removal percentages in the range 59-89\%. Total
   bacterial biomass (0.05-0.33 g C inh(-1) d(-1)) was always lower in
   treated than in raw water. A significant correlation was observed
   between BTOC (sum of BDOC and BOPC) and BOD. BPOC represented 68\% of
   BTOC in raw water and 43\% in treated water. The total biomass of
   bacteria constituted 8\% of the BTOC. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A review concerning the characterisation, production, modelling,
   significance and implications of soluble microbial products (SMP) in
   wastewater treatment is presented. The precise definition of SMP is open
   to debate, but is currently regarded as ``the pool of organic compounds
   that are released into solution from substrate metabolism (usually with
   biomass growth) and biomass decay{''}, although for anaerobic systems
   volatile fatty acids are not included as SMP. Some of the SMP have been
   identified as humic and fulvic acids, polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic
   acids, organic acids, amino acids, antibiotics; steroids, exocellular
   enzymes, siderophores, structural components of cells and products of
   energy metabolism. Crucially, SMP have been found to comprise the
   majority of soluble organic material in the effluents from biological
   treatment processes and their presence is, therefore, of particular
   interest in terms of achieving discharge consent levels for BOD and GOD.
   SMP also exhibit several characteristics, such as toxicity and metal
   chelating properties, which effect the performance of the treatment
   system, and their presence has also been shown to adversely affect the
   kinetic activity and the flocculating and settling properties of sludge.
   This review outlines some important discoveries with regard to the MW
   distribution, biodegradability;and treatability of SMP and also the
   effect of process parameters on their production. It also summarises the
   attempts at incorporating SMP formation into the modelling of wastewater
   treatment. However, it concludes that the knowledge regarding SMP is far
   from complete and that much work is still required to fully understand
   their contribution to the treatment process; some of these future
   research areas are then outlined. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Urban environments significantly alter the nature of recharge to
   underlying aquifers. Direct precipitation is reduced, but additional
   recharge may result from storm water runoff, mains supply leakage and
   sewer leakage. If urban aquifers are to be effectively and sustainably
   managed, it is vital that these recharge sources should be identified
   and quantified. A sound theoretical approach is the use of marker
   species for identifying the three principal sources of urban recharge
   (precipitation, mains and sewers). The ideal marker species should be
   unique to a particular recharge source (irrespective of geographic
   location), and easily identifiable in the groundwater system, enabling
   quantification of that source. A review of potential markers and a
   detailed study of the aquifer beneath the city of Nottingham, UK, was
   unable to find suitable markers for precipitation and mains leakage.
   Trihalomethanes, which are chlorination by-products, and so a potential
   marker of mains water, were hardly detected in either mains or
   groundwater. More potential markers are available for sewage, including
   d-limonene, which is a new ingredient in some detergents. For shallow
   groundwater, the most effective means of identifying sewage recharge was
   a combination of stable nitrogen isotopes;Ind microbiological
   indicators; effectively a sewage ``fingerprint{''}. This study confirms
   the need for a multi-component approach rather than using individual
   marker species. Additionally it demonstrates that the impact of sewer
   leakage on groundwater quality beneath Nottingham is generally not high.

Abstract = {{Commonly measured fecal bacteria concentrations in water and rainfall
   data were utilized as inputs for training a neural network model to
   distinguish between urban and agricultural fecal contamination present
   in inputs to a drinking water reservoir. Seven sites were selected that
   represented differing degrees of fecal contamination arising from
   agricultural, urban, or a blend of both land use activities. The absence
   of human sewage at the inlet sites to the reservoir was determined by
   analysis for coprostannol and serotyping of male-specific coliphage.
   Analyses for fecal coliform (FC), fecal streptococci (FS), total
   coliform (TC) and coliphage were conducted over 2 years from weekly
   samples collected from these sites during dry and rainy times during
   warm seasons. The average concentrations of microorganisms measured were
   highly variable and analysis of FC/FS ratios was not able to
   differentiate between urban or agriculturally impacted sites. A neural
   network model was written that used bacterial and weather data to
   differentiate between three site classifications: urban, agricultural
   and a mixture of these. The validity of the source identification,
   neural network model was verified through case study. (C) 1999 Elsevier

   polypropylene and Tygon (vinyl chloride-vinylidene chloride co-polymer).
   The materials were soaked in water, autoclaved and added to sterile
   liquid growth medium. 3 to 7 days after inoculating, the bacteria
   concentrations in the liquid and on the PTM were measured. There was no
   distinction in total growth between those tubes with and those without

Abstract = {{The results of the study of the HAAs formation in Water Works in Warsaw,
   Poland are presented. Water taken from Zegrzynskie Lake is characterized
   by elevated content of humic substances and algae bloom in hot seasons.
   The water is ozonated and chlorinated. The study was performed from
   October 1995 to November 1996. The water was analyzed on various stages
   of treatment and the following parameters were determined: HAAs, THMs,
   DOG, GOD, humic substances, UV absorbance, color and temperature. The
   big increase of HAAs concentrations occurred after water chlorination,
   up to 120 mu g/l. In 44\% it was DCAA and in 40\% TCAA. The highest
   concentration of HAAs was noticed in May and June, when water
   temperature was the highest and concentration of organic matter the
   biggest. The changes of HAAs concentrations with time were similar to
   those in THMs concentrations.
   The laboratory experiments on the water ozonation and chlorination
   indicated that ozonation has small influence on the HAAs formation.
   The study of the HAAs volatization during water boiling showed that
   removal of HAAs is rather small. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Effects of temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) on kinetics of
   microbial transformation processes of suspended sewer sediment
   particles, suspended wastewater particles and wastewater were
   investigated. Microbial activity was estimated by the oxygen uptake
   rate. The effects were studied under conditions where biomass had not
   acclimated to changed temperature or DO conditions. Hydrolysis processes
   limited the availability of organic substrates for the aerobic microbial
   growth. The effects of temperature were interpreted applying an
   Arrhenius relationship. The average Arrhenius constants found for sewer
   sediment particles and wastewater particles differed significantly from
   the average Arrhenius constant found for wastewater. The effects of
   dissolved oxygen concentration were interpreted applying a saturation
   type relationship. No differences between sewer sediment particles,
   wastewater particles and wastewater were found for the oxygen saturation
   coefficients. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biotransformation of wastewater particles with different settling
   velocities has been investigated based on analysis of long term oxygen
   uptake rate (OUR) measurements and a conceptual model describing aerobic
   transformations of organic matter has been used for interpretation. No
   significant changes in the biodegradability of wastewater particles with
   different settling velocities were found. In this respect wastewater
   particles differed from earlier findings for sewer sediments. Methods
   for determination of model parameters describing aerobic heterotrophic
   biomass growth and wastewater substrate transformations have been
   derived and values estimated by adding readily biodegradable substrate
   to wastewater particles and sewer sediments. The validity of modeling
   results was subsequently tested. The model was capable of predicting
   biomass growth for long term measurements correctly and to simulate the
   OUR satisfactorily, however, peaks in OUR were difficult to simulate,
   probably because of a simplified description of hydrolysis used in the
   concept. Generally, it can be recommended to use OUR measurements,
   interpreted by a conceptual model describing aerobic transformations df
   organic matter, as a valuable methodology for characterization of
   wastewater particles as well as suspended sewer sediments in terms of
   GOD-fractions and related biotransformations. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{An automated instrument is described which measures the oxygen demand of
   the organic content of a fluid based on oxidation by hydrogen peroxide
   with UV light. Residual hydrogen peroxide remaining after oxidation of
   the organic compounds is determined by gas liberated From H2O2
   decomposition by catalase, measured by a low flow gas meter. Oxygen
   produced by the internal chain reaction of H2O2 with hydroxyl free
   radicals is also measured and since the amount of peroxide added is
   known, the amount of peroxide used to oxidise the organic compounds can
   be calculated. A linear relationship between organic strength (measured
   as COD or BOD) and the output of the instrument was obtained for
   dilutions of raw sewage (25-150 mg l(-1) COD and undetectable to 54 mg
   l(-1) BOD), a synthetic sewage (100-1400 mg l(-1) COD and 68-952 mg
   l(-1) BOD) and effluents from a creamery (50-600 mg l(-1) COD) and
   potato processing factory (50-350 mg l(-1) GOD). The instrument is fully
   automated in the present version giving one sample measurement every 55
   min and could be used on-line as the basis of a control strategy for
   wastewater treatment plants. The instrument is robust, with relatively
   low capital cost and cost of ownership. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The recently proposed IAWQ activated sludge model No. 3 (ASM3) was
   evaluated for it's capacity in describing heterotrophic aerobic COD
   conversions. Hereto model simulations were compared to observed
   conversions in a laboratory sequencing batch reactor (SBR) with acetate
   as the sole substrate in the influent; no nitrification occurred. ASM3
   was simplified to take only those processes which were important in the
   reactor studied into account. In general it was possible to describe the
   overall conversions including oxygen uptake rates. However the
   difference in growth rate between feast and famine phase could not be
   described accurately. This was due to the fact that ASM3 allows growth
   on storage polymers only. Therefore a new model structure was proposed
   in which growth on external substrate is allowed. This model structure
   was further compared to experimental results at different temperatures.
   Since the polymer formation seemed to be strongly reduced at higher
   temperatures it was needed to describe this process with a negative
   temperature coefficient. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The paper evaluates the reactor performance, load potential and
   temperature response of a 70 degrees C, VFAs-fed UASB reactor, seeded
   with mesophilic granular sludge. Batch experiments were, in addition,
   conducted to assess the effect of temperature on the achievable residual
   VFAs in the 70 degrees C effluent. The performance of similarly-fed and
   seeded 35 and 55 degrees C UASB reactors was also tested. At a short HRT
   (2-3 h) and a moderate VLR of 12-20 g COD l(-1) d(-1), the 70 degrees C
   UASB achieved 66-74\% VFAs removal (acetate and butyrate 84-90\%,
   propionate < 20\%), while the 35 and 55 degrees C UASB reactors removed
   98-99\% of VFAs at a VLR of 34-35 g COD l(-1) d(-1) and an HRT of about
   1.1 h. The doubling of the OLR, by halving the sludge beds of the 35, 55
   and 70 degrees C UASB reactors, to about 3.68, 3.54 and 2.6 g COD g
   VS(-1), respectively, had no significant effect on the overall VFAs
   removal in these reactors. Temperature shifts (70-->55-->70 degrees C)
   in the 70 degrees C UASB led to a higher VFAs removal at 55 degrees C
   (mainly propionate, 46\%). In the batch experiments, 92-94 of the 70
   degrees C effluent residual VFAs were removed at 35 and 55 degrees C and
   72\% of acetate and < 7\% of VFAs were removed at 70 and 80 degrees C,
   respectively. The 70 degrees C UASB reactor survived starvation at 20
   degrees C for ca. a month and recovered fast after temperature was reset
   to 70 degrees C. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A simple point-source water quality model was constructed to explore
   hypothetical scenarios of linear alkylbenzene sulphonate (LAS) load
   variability, chemical degradation kinetics, river discharge and river
   velocities within the context of planned water quality monitoring in the
   river Lambro, northern Italy. LAS is an anionic surfactant and a
   commonly used ingredient of household detergents. Input loads were
   derived from flow and concentration measurements at sewage treatment
   works (STW). River travel times are approximated using hydraulic
   geometry concepts based on existing records of stage, discharge and
   velocity measurements. The,model proved to be especially useful in
   predicting the impact of overflows from an undersized STW near the top
   of the catchment on diurnal variations in water quality downstream.
   Probability density functions (pdfs) of LAS concentrations for a number
   of points on the river were approximated by running the model
   stochastically (using a Monte Carlo procedure) over independent
   frequency distributions of discharge, temperature and input load. The
   predicted concentration pdfs were then used to estimate the number of
   random grab and 24 h composite samples, which would be required in order
   to estimate mean concentrations with confidence. This is especially
   important in situations where the analysis is expensive and the sample
   budget is limited. The model results showed that grab sampling was not a
   viable strategy in the Lambro largely due to the very strong diurnal
   variability in concentrations induced by the STW overflow. This
   conclusion was corroborated by field data. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Two UASB reactors were in parallel operated over two years, the one
   receiving a sulfate-rich wastewater (2000 mg COD l(-1) Versus 1000 mg
   SO42--l(-1)), and the other receiving a sulfate-poor wastewater (2000 mg
   COD l(-1) versus 33 mg SO42--S l(-1)), in order to compare the process
   behaviors with each other. Vial activity tests revealed that
   undissociated hydrogen sulfide caused an inhibitory effect more
   seriously on methane producing bacteria, rather than on sulfate reducing
   bacteria. In order to alleviate sulfide inhibition, a sulfide-stripping
   device was incorporated in the sulfate-rich UASB reactor. As a result,
   the sulfate-rich UASB accommodated successfully a sulfate loading of 1.3
   kg SO42- -S m(-3) d(-1) with 90\% COD removal. The COD elimination
   carried out in the sulfate-rich UASB was associated with no
   methanogenesis, but was thoroughly performed by sulfate reducing
   bacteria solely. Hydrogen-utilizing methanogens were completely excluded
   from the sulfate-rich sludge consortium by proliferation of
   hydrogen-utilizing sulfate reducers. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In a previous study {[}Muscillo, M., Carducci;A., La Rosa, G., Cantiani,
   L., Marianelli, C. (1997a) Enteric virus detection in adriatic seawater
   by cell culture, polymerase chain reaction and polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis. Water Res. 31, 1980-1984] enterovirus strains were
   isolated from Adriatic seawater and estuarine water from the Foglia
   River, by infecting susceptible cells with ultrafiltrated water samples.
   In the present work we have studied three: of those samples, in which
   routine reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and
   sequencing analysis had identified the presence of poliovirus type 3
   (P3). In order to better estimate the risk to human health of such
   occurrence in bathing water (having bacteriological standards in line
   with the EEC directive 76/160), we set up a protocol to distinguish wild
   from Sabin P3 strains. Three sets of RT-PCR primers were engineered and
   their predicted products were: 593 nucleotides (nt) in the 5' noncoding
   (5'NC) region (11-603), 350 nt at the Vp3-Vp1 junction (2438-2787) of
   the capside protein genes, and 420 nt in the 2C (4309-4628) region,
   which is regarded as the hotspot of recombinant polioviruses. Eight
   reference ATCC strains, whose sequences were known, were also tested
   under the same experimental conditions in order to verify the accuracy
   of the RT-PCR reactions. The amplicons were directly sequenced by
   Big-dye(TM) terminator sequencing using a capillary automatic sequencer.
   The latter two regions found the same viral species Polio 3 in all the
   sample strains, with no meaningful distinction between P3/Leon/37 and
   P3/ Leon/12alb, the vaccine strain. The analyses in the 5'NC region were
   more useful, where genetic relationships and the predicted secondary
   structure suggested that the viruses were of vaccinal sources. Molecular
   data were confirmed by in vitro phenotypic marker tests rct/40, where
   all the examined samples displayed a temperature sensitive phanotype
   rct/40(-). Our results suggest that the 472(U-->C) transition alone, is
   not a predictive marker of reversion to neurovirulence. Finally, we
   conclude that the 220(U) constantly found in the consensus sequences of
   the samples can serve as a good predictor of rct/ 40(-) phenotype. (C)

Abstract = {{The presence of phenols in a stream is undesired because of their strong
   action, their toxicity to fish and unpleasant tastes and odours produced
   when water containing phenols is chlorinated.
   The phenolic compounds in the water environment may have a natural,
   industrial, domestic or agricultural origin.
   The purpose of this paper is to determine the nature, origin and trend
   of phenolic compounds in the river Po whose water is utilized to produce
   drinking water, during a 3 year period (1994-1996) at 15 day intervals.
   The Directive EEC 75/440 and the Italian DPR 515/82 impose a maximum
   admissable concentration for ``total phenols{''} by determination with
   4-aminoantipyrine. This method gives problems on the nature and
   detection of each compound. Therefore in this study GC-MS system was
   used in total ion and in selected ion monitoring after SPE extraction,
   for determinatibn of some chloro-, nitro- and alkyl-phenols. The
   obtained results show a considerable presence in the Spring-Summer
   period of alkylphenols utilized mainly as antioxidants and surfactants,
   deriving from industrial and domestic wastes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Anaerobic treatability of municipal landfill leachate was evaluated
   using lab-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (ASBR) at 35 degrees
   C. Experimental studies were conducted at wide-range of volumetric
   (0.4-9.4 g COD l(-1) d(-1)) and specific (0.2-1.9 g COD g(-1) VSS d(-1))
   loading rates by varying hydraulic retention times (HRT) (10-1.5 days)
   and influent wastewater COD's (3800-15900 mg l(-1)). The COD removal
   efficiencies were in the range of 64-85\% depending on volumetric and
   specific loading rates applied. The net daily biomass conversion yields
   were about 0.1 g volatile suspended solids (VSS) per g of COD removed.
   Bacterial decay rate constant was 0.01 d(-1). The maximum volumetric
   methane production rate (VMPR) of 1.85 I CH4 l(-1) d(-1) was achieved at
   the volumetric loading rate of 9.4 g COD l(-1) d(-1). The specific
   methane production rates in terms of COD were about 1.06 g CH4-COD g
   VSS-1 d(-1) in the reactor. The results have shown that about 83\% of
   COD removed during the treatment was converted to methane. The average
   biomass yield was determined as 0.12 g VSS per gram of COD removed. (C)

Abstract = {{The ability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) From landfill
   leachate-polluted groundwater to form complexes with copper (Cu) and
   lead (Pb) was investigated using an equilibrium method based on cation
   exchange. The DOC was studied in the original matrix with a minimum of
   manipulation. In two leachate-polluted groundwater samples (S1 and S2)
   containing 180 and 80 mg C l(-1), respectively, more than 95\% (in S1)
   and 90\% (in S2) of Cu and Pb in solution were bound in DOC complexes.
   Even at relatively low DOC concentrations (40 mg C l(-1)) in a
   leachate-polluted environment more than 85\% of the total Cu and Pb
   content in the solution were bound in DOC complexes. These data were
   used for evaluation of two speciation models and their default database
   (WHAM and MINTEQA2).
   The WHAM model overestimated the complexation of Cu and Pb in the
   groundwater samples, particularly at high degrees of complexation, where
   the predicted free metal ion activity was an order of magnitude lower
   than that observed in experiments. Much better agreement was obtained,
   however, by adjusting the default metal binding constants for fulvic
   acids in the WHAM model for Cu and Pb to 1.3. The MINTEQA2 model and its
   default database provided excellent prediction of Cu in sample S2 and Pb
   in sample S1 compared to the experimental results. For Cu in sample S1
   and Pb in sample SZ, however, the MINTEQA2 predictions deviated from the
   experimental results by amounts corresponding to a difference in the
   free metal ion activity of up to a factor of 2. Overall. the WHAM model
   with an adjusted database and the MINTEQ2 model with a default database
   offer very useful predictions on the extent of Cu and Pb complexation by
   dissolved organic carbon in leachate-polluted groundwater. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{A new ipn chromatographic method has been developed for the simultaneous
   analysis of the major matrix anions (chloride, nitrate, phosphate,
   sulfate, etc.), lower concentrated bromide, oxyhalides (iodate,
   chlorite, bromate) and nitrite in fresh waters and sea water. The method
   is based on an anion exchange chromatographic separation followed by a
   sequential analysis through conductivity and subsequent postcolumn
   reaction with UV detection: Whereas the matrix anions are quantified by
   conductivity, the oxyhalides and nitrite are measured by the oxidation
   product I; which they generate from iodide in the postcolumn reaction.
   The detection limits as determined for bromide, bromate and nitrite are
   3, 0.1 and 0.5 mu g l(-1), respectively. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{For the past decades, it has been observed that the organic contents of
   sewage sludge produced in Japan has been increasing. As a result,
   difficulties have been experienced with thickening and dewatering
   operations. Furthermore in Japan, where space is limited. space saving
   has been an urgent necessity for the sludge thickening-dewatering
   process. A new ultra-compact sludge treatment system has been developed
   to solve these problems.
   In this system, primary and excess activated sludge is directed to a
   sludge conditioning tank, where it is dosed with an inorganic coagulant
   and mixed to neutralize the surface charge of the sludge particles. This
   conditioned-sludge is then sent to a pelletizing/thickening tank, where
   an amphoteric polymer is added to pelletize the sludge. This results in
   pellets having a diameter of 1-2 cm. Using the same tank, water can then
   be removed with a special built-in device. resulting in a sludge with an
   increased concentration of solids. The sludge pellets produced have a
   high mechanical strength with a very low moisture content. The retention
   time of the sludge in the system (conditioning plus
   pelletizing/thickening) is only 10 to 20 min, as compared to about 12 h
   when conventional thickeners are used.
   Pilot plant scale studies in the laboratory and full scale
   investigations at treatment plants have demonstrated that this new
   system can eliminate conventional thickeners, enabling ``direct{''}
   sludge dewatering. Compared with conventional thickening, the new system
   produces a sludge cake with 3-5\%-less moisture content and at a rate
   greater than 200 kg-ds/m/h using a belt press filter. Further, the
   soluble phosphorus in the sludge can be converted to an insoluble form
   through the addition of an inorganic coagulant, Also, because of the
   short retention time of the sludge in the system, there is less
   opportunity for the sludge to become septic and to release phosphorus
   into the supernatant which normally is returned to the wastewater flow.

Abstract = {{Cyanobacteria can produce toxins, tastes and odors which significantly
   impair water quality. Removal of intact cyanobacterial cells with their

   the concentration of taste, odor and toxic cell metabolites present in
   the treated water. In this study, the effect of conventional water
   treatment processes using aluminum sulphate (alum) on the integrity of
   cells of toxic Microcystis aeruginosa was evaluated using both jar tests
   and pilot plant studies. Removal of M. aeruginosa cells by alum
   flocculation using a jar test apparatus indicated all cells were removed
   without damage to membrane integrity. Thus the chemical treatment and
   mechanical action did not damage the cultured M. aeruginosa cells and,
   more importantly, did not result in additional release of cell
   metabolites above background concentrations. For pilot plant
   experiments, which consisted of
   coagulation/flocculation-sedimentation-filtration, most of the cells
   were removed intact and no additional microcystin was found in the
   finished water. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The change in microbial diversity in a submerged aerobic biofilter, into
   which a persistent chemical of dimethylformamide was fed, were analyzed
   based on the quinone profiles using a new diversity index of the
   respiratory quinones (DQ) and an index of equitability of the
   distribution of quinone species (EQ) originally proposed in this study:
   D xQ = (Sigma f(k)(1.2))(2), EQ = DQ/n. Where, f(k) is the mole fraction
   of quinone species k and n is the number of quinone species,
   respectively. The DQ value increases with an increase in the number and
   the equitability of the distribution of quinone species. In the case
   where the mole fractions of all quinone species are equal. the value of
   DQ becomes equal to the number of quinone species and the EQ value
   becomes 1. A simulation analyses shows that DQ has a higher sensitivity
   to the change in number of quinone species than Shannon's index, i.e;
   one of the most widely used diversity indices. The relative sensitivity
   of DQ to the change in mole fraction of quinone species is higher than
   that of Shannon's diversity index for natural ecosystems in which many
   kinds of quinone species exist and occupy smaller fractions.
   The quinone profiles of the biofilm significantly changed and the values
   of DQ and EQ increased during the acclimation of the biofilm to
   dimethylformamide in the biofilter. The plot,of the mole fraction of
   dominant quinone species to the DQ values showed higher sensitivity to
   the change in the microbial community, These results indicated that DQ
   and EQ are useful indices for the evaluation of the changes;in the
   microbial community in response to environmental conditions. (C) 1999

   with increasing concentration of the humic substances. Maximum removal
   of the humic substances was found to occur in the pH range from 5.0 to.
   7.0, due to the adsorption of humic substances on the surface of
   Al(OH)(3(s)) crystal. Sequential extraction of the humic substances
   adsorbed on Al(OH)(3(s)) using the Soxhlet technique with different

Abstract = {{The anaerobic hydrolysis and acidification of wastewaters rich in
   organic suspended solids and protein was studied in continuous stirred
   reactors. The effluents employed in this study were obtained from a fish
   meal factory (30-120 g COD/1, 5-40 g VSS/1, 10-30 g protein/1). The
   effect of stirring on the anaerobic biodegradability was initially
   determined and, on the basis of these results, the
   hydrolysis-acidification step was optimised in terms of temperature and
   HRT. Thermophilic (55 degrees C) and mesophilic (37 degrees C) reactors
   were operated at HRT ranging from 6 to 48 h. No nutrients were added,
   and pH remained in the range 7.2-7.7 due to the high alkalinity.
   Extremely high organic loading rates (OLR) were applied (up to 400 kg
   COD/m(3). d) with no significant methane production, obtaining maxi mum
   efficiencies of 44\% for acidification, 58\% for VSS removal and 80\%
   for protein removal at 55 degrees C and 24 h of HRT. However,
   acidification (2 kg COD-VFA/m(3) h) and VSS removal rates (0.4 kg VSSr/
   m(3) h) were maximum at HRT of 12-24 h, operating at the same
   temperature. Most of protein was converted into VFA and ammonia, even
   when working at the lowest HRT. As a consequence. the content of total
   ammonia in these reactors reached extremely high values in both cases
   (15-17 g N-TA/l), which implies high concentrations of free ammonia (up
   to 0.66 g N-FA. 1 at 37 degrees C and 1.64 g N-FA/l at 55 degrees C),
   these differences bring due to the effect of temperature on the
   dissociation equilibrium. Although a more efficient operation was
   achieved at 55 degrees C, mesophilic operation is recommended if a
   two-phase system was considered for the overall treatment of these
   effluents, since toxic effects from free ammonia would impede a stable
   operation in tee methanogenic reactor at thermophilic conditions. (C)

Abstract = {{The capital of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh is supplied with drinking water from
   both treated groundwater and desalinated sea water. Groundwater
   contributes about 35\% to the total water supply and is treated in six
   treatment plants containing cooling, softening, filtration, reverse
   osmosis and posttreatment processes; An extensive two and a half years
   study aimed at the evaluation of Riyadh water treatment plants
   performance and the investigation of chemical treatment alternatives has
   been undertaken. The work involved an evaluation of the plants chemical
   treatment in which the effectiveness of softening chemicals was
   investigated by conducting jar test, pilot plant and full-scale
   implementation experiments. The results indicate that by optimizing the
   currently used chemicals it is possible to save 19\% in chemicals cost
   or approximately million SR 3.71 a year. Caustic soda can be a
   competitive alternative in four plants replacing lime, soda ash and
   sodium aluminate. Moreover, there is a great potential of saving million
   SR 7.04 a year at the largest plant by simple pH-adjustment using
   sulfuric acid for the purpose of water stabilization. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A biofilm for simultaneous removal of N and P was developed using a
   continuous lab-scale setup alternating between anaerobic and anoxic
   conditions. BIOSTYR was used as carrier material. Result, showed an
   exponential increase in initial anaerobic P-release rate for the first
   month and subsequently a constant rate. The theory of 1/2 and 0 order of
   reaction in the bulk watts depending on penetration depth into the film
   was verified for anaerobic P-release using batch tests. Stoichiometric
   coefficients were for anaerobic P-release to COD-uptake 0.25 g P/g COD
   and for anoxic P-uptake to nitrate removal 0.06 mol P/mol e(-). Both
   values are low compared to the literature for enriched denitrifying
   cultures which is taken as an indication of the presence of competing
   bacteria with the capacity of storing GOD. Since the values did not
   change during the build up period it appears that the competing bacteria
   survive well with the continuous alternating mode of operation. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Denitrification under high nitrate concentration was studied in a
   fed-batch mode. Methanol, sodium acetate and effluent from anaerobic
   digesters (AD) were compared as the carbon sources. An alternating
   oxy-anoxy regime (10 min aeration over a period of 110 min) seems to
   promote the establishment of denitrifying bio-flocks of good settling
   characteristics. The bio-flocks produced in an anoxic reactor were of
   inferior settling characteristics. Bio-flocks at concentrations of 4 to
   5 g VSS/l denitrify efficiently on all three carbon sources tested. A
   maximum nitrate removal rate was found to be 0.486 g NO3--N/(g VSS day).
   Nitrite accumulated initially but its concentration decreased with time
   and eventually reached zero when acetate or AD effluent were used as the
   carbon source. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fouling of quartz jackets around mercury are lamps represents a
   performance limitation in photochemical reactors used in treatment of
   aqueous streams, such as those used in disinfection. photocatalysis and
   UV-based advanced oxidation processes. These fouling materials are
   generally comprised of inorganic constituents, though little is known
   about their specific chemistry. The goal of this paper is to
   characterize inorganic fouling bn quartz surfaces in photoreactors by
   evaluation of the composition of fouling materials and chemical analysis
   of corresponding waters. Results showed that the fouling materials were
   predominantly amorphous inorganics. Fouling material composition was
   found to be site-specific. Cation composition in the fouling materials
   was found to be highly complex, with many metals being common to ail
   samples: in all cases. iron,aluminum and calcium were found to represent
   the majority of the metals present. Predominant anions included
   carbonate. sulfate, hydroxide, chloride and phosphate. In the absence of
   UV radiation and heat from UV lamps, the extent of inorganic fouling was
   substantially diminished. Thermally-induced precipitation of inorganic
   species and impaction of preexisting colloidal particles were
   hypothesized to be the primary mechanisms responsible for inorganic
   fouling; accumulation of materials due to direct ion exchange reactions
   with the quartz surfaces was shown to be of negligible importance. (C)

Abstract = {{The second paper of this series has been developed to present the
   results of a study of the temporal and spatial distributions of fouling
   materials at quartz-water interfaces in UV photoreactors. Fouling
   processes were monitored using in situ UV intensity measurements to
   determine the decrease in optical transmission through quartz jackets
   during the experiments; chemical analysis of fouling materials and
   effluents was used to characterize the temporal/spatial distributions of
   fouling materials. Temporal analyses of fouling materials indicated that
   fouling was a zero-order process following an induction period. Fouling
   reactions were found to be capable of causing substantial (ca. 50\%)
   reductions in local UV intensity within the irradiated zone over a
   period of 1-28 days, depending on site-specific water characteristics
   and operating conditions. Increasing accumulation of fouling materials
   in the longitudinal direction and the observation of zero-order fouling
   kinetics supported the hypothesis that thermally-induced
   (co)precipitation plays an important role in the accumulation of fouling
   materials. A second mechanism, impaction of preexisting particles and
   quartz surfaces, resulted in heterogeneity in spatial accumulation
   around quartz jackets. Time-course UV intensity measurements indicated
   that iron and aluminum-based treatments (e.g, for phosphorous removal)
   accelerated fouling processes substantially. Fluid shear also played a
   role in inorganic fouling in that it influenced the agglomeration of
   colloidal particles. In the absence of radiation from the lamps, lamp
   jackets were found to foul quickly with organic materials. As compared
   with inorganic fouling materials, the organic constituents were found to
   be loosely held to the quartz surface. Illumination of UV lamps was
   found to rapidly diminish organic accumulation and promote inorganic
   fouling. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd, All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of the third paper in this series is to present a mathematical
   model of inorganic fouling of quartz surfaces in ultraviolet (UV)
   photochemical reactors and to further our understanding of fouling
   processes. The mathematical model was developed to account for mass.
   energy and momentum transport in the immediate vicinity of the
   quartz-water interface. The effects of operating conditions and water
   composition on fouling were studied by conducting numerical simulations
   within the range of relevant approach velocities and dissolved
   constituent concentrations. The numerical simulations showed that
   fouling processes were governed by the thermal output of the lamps,
   hydrodynamics and inorganic composition in effluents. The model predicts
   accumulation of materials with inverse solubilities that will increase
   in the direction of flow due to the effects of the lamps on the
   temperature field. Model results indicated that approach velocities of
   less than approximately 10 cm/s represent an important threshold from
   the standpoint of the temperature field; systems that are characterized
   by water chemistry that is conducive to fouling (i.e, near saturation
   with respect to precipitation reactions) are likely to experience severe
   precipitation fouling under these conditions. The model also
   demonstrated that accelerated fouling processes, which have been
   observed following the addition of iron and aluminum-based chemicals at
   wastewater treatment facilities, could result in local pH effects upon
   precipitate formation. The mathematical model was found to be capable of
   explaining fouling behavior observed in field experiments (longitudinal
   and radial heterogeneity) and providing insights into fouling
   mechanisms. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional vertically averaged flow model was applied to study
   the circulation patterns in Lake Belau (Northern Germany). The lake is
   north-south oriented, with a maximum extension of 2.2 km and is situated
   in a dead ice hole with steep slopes on the east and west coasts. A parr
   of the coastal area is covered with forest, creating a strong shelter
   from prevailing south-westerly winds. The system of shallow water
   equations is discretized with the modified Utnes (1990) scheme which is
   characterized by a semi-decoupling algorithm. The continuity equation is
   rearranged to Helmholtz equation form. The upwinding Tabata (1977)
   method is used to approximate convective terms. Extensive wind (more
   than 60 observations) and current measurements (5 points) conducted all
   over the lake enabled us to verify the simulation results with
   observations. Under spatially homogeneous wind conditions the model
   predicts a two cell circulation system, that covers most part of the
   lake. Taking the spatial variation of wind speed due to shelter into
   account, the flow field changes drastically. The two cell system is
   replaced by one large cell, with a strong reverse jet along the western

Abstract = {{Protonated, non-living biomass of the brown alga Sargassum fluitans
   effectively sequestered uranyl ions from aqueous solution, with the
   maximum uranium sorption capacity exceeding 560 mg/g, 330 mg/g and 150
   mg/g at pH 4.0, 3.2 and 2.6, respectively. At various pH levels, batch
   sorption equilibrium was reached within 3 h and the sorption isotherms
   were interpreted in terms of the Langmuir model. The sorption system pH
   profoundly affected uranium sorption capacities and sorption mechanisms
   through the hydrolysis of uranyl ions in aqueous solution. While only
   UO22+ ions existing at pH 2.6 were exchanging with protons on the
   biomass, the high uranium sorption at pH 4.0 was attributed to the
   existence of hydrolysed uranyl ions, UO2OH+, (UO2)(3)(OH)(5)(+) and
   (UO2)(2)(OH)(2)(2+). Each mole of uranium binding to the biomass was
   accompanied by the consumption of approximately 2 mol of LiOH for
   maintenance of the desired constant pH. The uranium could be easily
   recovered from the metal-loaded biomass by elution with 0.1 N HCl. The
   desorption was complete and the damage to the biomass was slight. These
   findings indicate an enormous potential of biosorption in uranium
   removal from aqueous solutions. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Roadside gully Dots form a common and important part of many surface
   water drainage networks. Their primary Function is to retain larger

   with sediment deposition in downstream drainage structures and receiving
   waters. Typical processes occurring in pots during wet weather are
   dilution, dispersion, sedimentation, sediment bed build-up and erosion,
   washout of suspended and dissolved pollutants From the pot liquor and
   reaeration of the pot liquor. A dynamic water quality model has been
   developed to simulate these processes. To study the pollutant washout
   patterns and sludge bed erosion, simulated wet weather tests were
   carried out on pots draining six different types of roads. Results
   corroborated earlier findings and were used to successfully calibrate
   and verify the model. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{3373-3378}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A new method for the extraction of the active coagulation component from
   Moringa oleifera seeds was developed and compared with the ordinary
   wafer extraction method (MOC-DW). In the new method, 1.0 mol l(-1)
   solution of sodium chloride (MOC-SC) and other sails were used for
   extraction of the active coagulation component. Batch coagulation
   experiments were conducted using 500 mi of low turbid water (50 NTU).
   Coagulation efficiencies were evaluated based on the dosage required to
   remove kaolinite turbidity in water. MOC-SC showed better coagulation
   activity-with dosages 7.4 times lower than that using MOC-DW for the
   removal of kaolinite turbidity. MOC-SC could effectively coagulate more
   than 95\% of the 50 NTU initial kaolin turbidity using only 4 ml l(-1),
   while 32 ml l(-1) of MOC-DW could only remove about 78\% of the same
   kaolin turbidity. The improvement of coagulation efficiency by NaCl is
   apparently due to the salting-in mechanism in proteins wherein a salt
   increases protein-protein dissociations, leading to increasing protein
   solubility as the salt ionic strength increases. There was no difference
   in the coagulation efficiency observed for extracts using any of four
   1:1 salts (NaCl, KNO3, KCl and NaNO3) in our study. Purification and
   isolation of the active component confirmed that the active component of
   MOC-SC was mainly protein. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In 1995 and 1996 laboratory tests and pilot scale tests have indicated
   that backwash water from sand filters can be recovered by dead-end
   membrane filtration treatment. These test results showed that the
   heavily contaminated water, containing suspended solids from 100-1,000
   mg/l consisting of mainly iron hydroxides and manganese oxides, can be
   purified into drinking water in one treatment step. In order to prove
   that this technology is also suitable for the recovery of backwash water
   on practical scale, a full-scale dead-end membrane filtration
   installation has been designed and built at the Eindhoven production
   plant of the Water Utility Company East Brabant dagger in The
   Netherlands (operational since January 1997). The design was based on a
   flux of 170 J/m(2) h bar and a maximum capacity of 120 m(3)/h. Although
   for the time being the installation has not been operated at maximum
   capacity: investigation into its performance during a longer period
   shows that the used method proved beyond any doubt to be very
   appropriate in terms of purification performance, energy and chemical
   consumption, productivity, recovery and costs. After more than one year,
   the full-scale plant still operates at a flux of 160 l/m(2) h bar. The
   energy consumption turned out to be even lower than expected and amounts
   to 0.15 kWh/m(3). The recovery was found to be 93\%. The exploitation
   costs amounts to 0.43 NLG/m(3) (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study on the kinetics of chemical and biological
   oxygen uptakes within tidal river sediment and thereby modelled the
   oxygen uptake by the sediment. Sediment cores were taken from a major
   tidal river, the Shing-Mun River in Hong Kong. Characterization of the
   core found that the sediment contained high concentrations df iron and
   organic matter. The kinetics within the sediment were investigated with
   a set of batch tests using dispersed subsamples taken from different
   depths of the core. The results showed that the chemical oxygen uptake
   followed zero-order kinetics with respect to sediment quantity, and its
   uptake rate coefficient varied less with the depth. The mean value of
   the coefficient was found to be 8.25 x 10(-4) day(-1). The batch tests
   also confirmed that the biological oxygen uptake rate in the sediment
   can be described by a Monod function of dissolved oxygen (DO). It was
   also found that potential bioactivity of the sediment was kept constant
   in its 10-cm thick upper layer. Based upon these results, the concept of
   a hybrid benthic biofilm was introduced to develop a model of the
   sediment oxygen uptake (SOU). To verify the proposed SOU model,
   comparisons of experimental data with model predictions were Conducted,
   which showed that the proposed SOU model perfectly Fitted the
   experimental results at different water temperatures ranging From 11 to
   27 degrees C. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In rivers and shallow lakes, the traditional cylindrical sediment trap
   often overestimates particle Aux towards the bottom. Factors up to 5
   were found in different environments. In order to overcome the lack of
   reliable sedimentation rates for organic and inorganic matter in moving
   waters, a round plate trap has been developed and rested. Its basic
   principle of operation is the dependence of particle settling on water
   flow. Experiments in the River Spree showed that trapping on a plate
   decreased nonlinearly with increasing approach velocity (bottom shear
   stress), whereas trapping in a cylinder demonstrated no systematic
   variation with velocity.
   The loss of collected material during surfacing is the major technical
   problem of such a plate sediment trap. A solution was found by lowering
   the plate hydraulically into the trap body after collection. Tests in
   the flume at approach velocities up td 15 cm s(-1) showed that all
   peripheral compartments do not disturb the settling process on the
   plate, that a ``run-up margin{''} of 10 cm width and an undercut bevel,
   with a slope only on the lower side of the plate are sufficient to avoid
   interference from the streamed edge, and that inclinations of the plate
   up to 12 degrees do not play an important role for particle collection.
   In the flume, trapping rates are found on the plates, which are very
   similar to those found) at the bottom.
   Field tests in the River Spree has been shown that a trap with a
   diameter of 35 cm, together with suspension equipment and a hydraulic
   closure system works well. Trapping rates were found which were
   systematically lower than those for cylindrical traps. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The measurement of the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of an aqueous
   solution using a thermally-killed Bacillus subtilis BOD biosensor was
   unaffected by the presence of 5 mM of Al(3+) Cd(2+), Co(2+), Cr(3+),
   Fe(2+), Fe(3+), Ni(2+) and Pb(2+) in the sample. In the presence of 5 mM
   of Zn(2+) Mn(2+) and Sn(2+), the sensor over-estimated the BOD(5) of the
   test samples by 12-68\% compared with 13\% under-estimation at the same
   concentration of Cu(2+). The sensor completely and irreversibly Lost its
   BOD sensing ability in the presence of 0.5 mM of Ag(+) or Hg(2+).
   Similar effect was observed with a living B. subtilis BOD biosensor. The
   interference of copper, manganese, stannous and zinc ions was
   effectively eliminated by dosing the substrate with 6.2 mM of ethylene
   diamine tetra-acetate (EDTA) or 5.8 mM of sodium diethyl dithiocarbamate
   (DDTC). The total concentration of mercury of the solution at which the
   sensor completely and irreversibly lost its BOD sensing characteristics
   was raised from 0.5 to 4.7 mM when the solution was dosed with 31.8 mM
   of NH(4)Cl; to 6 mM with 6.2 mM EDTA and to 3 mM with 5.8 mM DDTC. The
   total concentration of silver which would incapacitate the sensor was
   correspondingly raised to 9.7, 5 and 5.5 mM for the respective dosages
   and complexing agents. The sensor showed no response towards NH(4)Cl up
   to about 0.5 M and up to about 50 mM of EDTA and DDTC. (C) Published by

   strength: 0.1 M). Spectrophotometric analyses showed that the addition
   of H2O2 into a solution of Fe-III immediately led to the formation of
   species absorbing in the region 300-600 nm. Calculations made from the
   spectral data gave evidence of the formation of two ferric hydroperoxy

Abstract = {{Groundwater was treated with chlorine and chloramine to study the
   incorporation and survival of Escherichia coli in developing biofilms in
   laboratory-scale units. Membrane filter and standard spread plate
   procedure were used to enumerate coliform and heterotrophic plate count
   bacteria respectively. Within 96 h the adhesion of heterotrophic plate
   count bacteria on stainless steel coupons was obvious in all systems,
   with a higher number of organisms (4 log cfu cm(-2)) noted for the
   non-disinfected water. Attachment of E. coli added 24 h after the
   formation of young biofilms was obvious on stainless steel coupons
   exposed to the non-disinfected water (9 cfu cm(-2)) and chlorinated
   water (2 cfu cm(-2)). A significant difference between E. coli counts in
   the non-disinfected water and chloraminated water, and the chlorinated
   and chloraminated water, was found. However. the ANOVA test indicated no
   significant difference in E. coli counts for the non-disinfected water
   and chlorinated water. This investigation revealed the effectiveness of
   chloramine in preventing the attachment of E, coli in developing
   biofilm. (C), 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Urban stormwater runoff is considered to be a major input source of
   heavy metals to surface waterways. In this study. lead runoff from
   painted structures in an urban setting was assessed. In many cases, high
   lead concentrations were found. Lead concentrations (100 ml over 1600
   cm(2)) from 169 different structures followed the order (geometric mean,
   median. Q10-Q90): wood (40, 49, 2.6-380 mu g/ 1)> brick (22, 16, 3.3-240
   mu g/l) > block (9.7, 8.0, <2-110 mu g/l). Lead concentration depended
   strongly on paint age and condition. Lead levels from washes of older
   paints were much higher than from freshly painted surfaces, which were
   demonstrated quantitatively as: paint age {[}> 10 y] (77, 88, 6.9-590 mu
   g/l) much greater than {[}5-10 y] (22, 16, < 2-240 mu g/l)> {[}0-5 y]
   (8.4, 8.1, < 2-64 mu g/l). Lead from surface washes was found to be 70\%
   or greater in particulate lead form, suggesting the release of lead
   pigments From weathered paints. High intensity washes were found to
   liberate more particulate lead than lower intensities. ties. Old surface
   paints can contribute high masses of lead into a watershed, targeting
   these structures for source preventive actions to curtail future lead
   input into the environment: (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study investigated the feasibility of using granular activated
   carbon (GAC) to remove bromate ion (BrO3-) from drinking water through a
   rapid small-scale column test (RSSCT) method and a pilot-scale study.
   Results from RSSCT tests indicated that the GAC capacity for BrO3-
   removal was carbon-specific and dependent on the source water quality
   and empty bed contact time (EBCT). The presence of dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) and anions, Such as bromide, nitrate, and sulfate, resulted
   in poor BrO3- reduction. On the other hand, BrO3- removal was improved
   by increasing EBCT. The reduction capacity of spent GAC could be
   completely recovered by thermal regeneration. Under RSSCT conditions,
   the results showed that preloading with natural water significantly
   decreased the capacity of GAC for BrO3- removal whereas in the pilot
   plant study, a GAC column (operating with 20-min EBCT) preloaded for 110
   days achieved a BrO3- removal ranging from 57 to 92\% for at least 98
   days, and the BrO3- amount removed was found to be proportional to the
   influent BrO3- concentration. These limited data suggest that if
   suitable GAC is used, GAC performed in the biological mode may achieve a
   longer bedlife for BrO3- removal. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The abundances and grazing impact on bacteria of ciliated protozoa and
   heterotrophic nanoflagellates in a lagoon series and grass filter sewage
   treatment system, at the Melbourne Water Treatment. Plant at Werribee in
   Australia. were investigated between April and July 1995. Bacterial
   concentrations decreased along the lagoon series and the grass
   filtration systems, but were twice as high in the latter. Heterotrophic
   nanoflagellates (HNAN) followed the same trend in distribution as their
   bacterial food supply, but were 10 times higher in the grass filter.
   Ciliates, however, showed a much more variable distribution in both
   systems and similar densities.
   Calculated grazing rates indicated that HNAN were responsible for
   removing the highest proportion of bacterial biomass in both systems. In
   the grass filter ciliate grazing was usually below 11\% that of the HNAN
   and in the lagoons ciliates never exceeded 11\% of the HNAN grazing
   levels. HNAN were important in these two treatment systems as the major
   consumers of bacteria and contributed to the production of good quality
   effluents. This contrasts with other types of sewage treatment where
   ciliates have been shown to be the major grazers of bacteria. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Simultaneous sorption of nonionic surfactant (alkylmonoethers ALM-10)
   and heavy metal cations (lead, nickel) by Purolite C 106 carboxylic
   acrylcationic exchanger has been investigated. Sorption isotherms and
   kinetic curves were measured using spectrophotometric determination for
   nonionic surfactant and complexometric titration for heavy metals. The
   sorption of metal cations, surfactant molecules and products of their
   interaction takes place simultaneously. In the absence of surfactant the
   sorption of metal cations determined experimentally corresponds to that
   calculated from the change in the equilibrium solution pH, assuming that
   two hydrogen cations are replaced by one metal cation. In the presence
   of surfactant the change in pH is lower than that without surfactant:
   the total sorption of metal determined experimentally is higher than
   that calculated From the change in pH. It is because the sorption of
   metal takes place in the form of not only free cations but also cations
   bonded to the surfactant. The sorption of metal bonded to the surfactant
   can be evaluated from both the total metal adsorbed which was determined
   experimentally and the sorption of the free cations. The total sorption
   of lead(II) is higher than that of nickel(II) (transition metal).
   Subsequently the action of lead(II) results in the decrease of the
   equilibrium sorption of surfactant while the action of nickel(II) on the
   equilibrium sorption of surfactant is insignificant. The sorption of
   metal cations decreases in the presence of surfactant. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The adsorption capacity of biofilm coated activated carbon from a
   biological fluidized bed reactor which treated toluene contaminated
   water was determined systematically over an extended period of
   operation. The adsorption capacity of biocoated carbon remained at
   greater than 70\% of initial levels during the first two months. After
   six months of operation, the remaining capacity was still approximately
   40, 52 and 57\% of the initial value for equilibrium toluene
   concentrations of 0.1, 3 and 10 mg/L, respectively. If the adsorption
   removal mechanism is used to provide a buffer during the transient
   conditions, this remaining capacity may be sufficient without carbon
   replacement. There was no direct relation between the amount of biomass
   or the thickness of the biofilm on the carbon and the remaining
   adsorptive capacity. The loss of adsorption capacity over an extended
   period of operation appears to result directly from bioactivity, rather
   than from toluene loading. Bioregeneration of this long-term capacity
   loss. was not observed with continued operation for 100 days after the
   toluene feed was stopped and the nutrient and oxygen supplies continued.

Abstract = {{In this study desiccant silica gel (DSG was compared with chromatography
   silica gel (CSG) for its ability to remove metal ions including Pb2+,
   Cu2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cd2+ and UO22+ from solution.
   The equilibration lime was shorter for UO22+ (less than 1 h) than for
   the heavy metal ions (2-3 h) and adsorption by DSG look longer to reach
   equilibrium compared with CSG, probably due to the smaller mean diameter
   of its pores. The adsorption process showed first order kinetics for all
   the metals studied. The mass transfer coefficients and overall rate
   constants were determined for each of the metals. The adsorption rates
   of the metal ions, in order of decreasing magnitude, were UO22+ > Pb2+
   >- Cu2+ > Zn2+ >Ni2+ > Cd2+ for both DSG and CSG.
   Metal uptake was found to increase rapidly within a two pH unit range
   characteristic for each metal. The adsorption of the metal ions obeyed
   the Langmuir isotherm and followed the preferential order UO22+ > Pb2+ >
   Cu2+ > Ni2+ >Zn2+ >Cd2+. Similarity of the isotherms for the individual
   metals was observed for both DSG and CSG, indicating a comparable
   removal capacity of DSG and its possible use as an alternative to CSG in
   adsorption applications.
   Adsorption from lead(II)-uranium(VI) solutions showed that the uptake of
   each metal was considerably reduced with an increasing concentration of
   the other, the adsorption of lead(II) being more strongly influenced by
   uranium(VI) than vice versa due to the higher affinity of silica gel for
   the latter. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption of uranium(VI) and lead(II) on fixed beds of
   chromatography silica gel (CSG) and desiccant silica gel (DSG) was
   investigated at initial pH 5.15 and an initial concentration of 0.5 and
   0.1 mM for uranium(Vi) and lead(Il), respectively, and exhibited a
   constant pattern of breakthrough curves at various bed heights and flow
   rates. The experimental data gave a good fit to the bed depth-service
   time (BDST) model at 50\% breakthrough with the bed capacity close to
   the value predicted from batch study results. The adsorption performance
   of the silica gel columns could be well described by the Clark model at
   the ratios of concentration of effluent to influent (C/C-0) up to 0.3
   for uranium(VI) and 0.5 for lead(II). Above these levels, the model was
   approximately valid for uranium(VI), while a large deviation occurred
   with lead(IT) adsorption. Application of the Wolborska model to the data
   at C/C-0 ratios lower than 0.5 enabled the determination of the kinetic
   coefficients for mass transfer in these systems. Furthermore, it was
   found that uranium(VI) could be effectively separated from lead(II) by
   using a column packed either with CSG or DSG at pH 3.50.
   Complete removal of uranium(VI) adsorbed to a packed bed of silica gel
   was obtained by employing 4.5 M HNO3 as eluant. Six and seven bed
   volumes of 4.5 M HNO3 were required for the elution of uranium(VI) from
   CSG and DSC, respectively. For lead(II), complete desorption From the
   column required 3.0 and 3.5 bed volumes of 1.5 M HNO3 solution for CSG
   and DSG, respectively.
   For both uranium(VI) and lead(II) it was found that the DSG-packed
   column exhibited better performance than CSG in terms of service time
   and volume of solution treated, and gave similar value of the adsorbent
   usage rate, suggesting that DSG can be used instead of CSG in column
   applications. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted to investigate the efficiency of using
   soybean peroxidase (SBP) to remove several different phenolic compounds
   from unbuffered synthetic wastewater. The phenol derivatives studied
   included parent phenol, chlorinated phenols, cresols, 2,4-dichlorophenol
   and 4,4'-isopropylidenediphenol (commonly known as bisphenol A). Optimum
   conditions to achieve at least 95\% removal of these compounds were
   determined for the following parameters: pn, SEP dose in the absence and
   presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG), hydrogen peroxide to substrate
   ratio, and PEG dose, Experimental results showed that SEP efficiently
   removed aromatic compounds from synthetic wastewater in the presence of
   hydrogen peroxide. An increase in the hydrogen peroxide to substrate
   ratio beyond the optimum resulted in enzyme inactivation in all cases
   except for bisphenol A. The optimum pH for different phenolic compounds
   ranged from 5.5 to 8. For each substrate. the optimum enzyme dose in the
   presence of PEG varied significantly. The studies showed that PEG only
   slightly reduced the amount of SEP required For 95\% removal of the
   substrate. For most of the substrates, an increase in PEG dose beyond
   the optimum dose did not significantly change the removal efficiency.

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this study, alum sludge was recycled using a chemical precipitation
   process to promote the removal of lead metal in wastewater. To make the
   process more cost-effective, two different pH ranges were suggested for
   daily operation, depending on the involvement or otherwise of an
   aluminum regeneration process at a later stage. If aluminum regeneration
   was expected, an elevated pH (11.6) was suggested to optimize both the
   aluminum regeneration and lead removal. Lead hydroxide coprecipitated
   with alum sludge in alkaline conditions, where the high pH would also
   facilitate the alkaline regeneration of alum at a later stage. With the
   use of recycled alum sludge (RAS) in the coagulation process, lead
   removal rates increased from 79\% to 96-98\% with 100-180 mg/l of RAS,
   while the required fresh alum dosage was reduced from 175 mg/l to
   50-12.5 mg/l only, If no fresh alum is added to the system, the RAS can
   still remove up to 94\% of lead at low recycling doses (75-100 mg/l),
   which suggests that the sweep-flee mechanism is crucial to the sludge
   reuse process. However, if the regeneration of aluminum is not required,
   a lower initial pH (10.5) should be used to decrease chemical costs. (C)

Abstract = {{Activated sludge ballasting by calcium carbonate, apatite and a blend of
   talc and chlorite was investigated in a continuous
   denitrification-nitrification pilot plant. The sludge mineral material
   interaction was studied by analyzing the surface characteristics of the
   mineral materials, activated sludge and the fate of the mineral material
   in the treatment process. The blend of talc and chlorite had the highest
   positive surface charge and hydrophobicity. It was also the only mineral
   material to import metal ions for the flocculation mechanism. The blend
   of talc and chlorite: improved both settleability and filterability,
   while calcium carbonate only improved settleability. Assuming that the
   same amount of mineral material in sludge gave the same sludge volume
   index (SVI), only about 50\% of the added calcium carbonate interacted
   with sludge. Apatite had no positive effect at all. A one-time dose of
   1.2 g of the blend of talc and chlorite per 1 g of mixed liquor volatile
   suspended solids (MLVSS) immediately improved the SVI from 800 ml/g to
   less than 200 ml/g. Thereafter, a daily dose of 0.1 g per 1 g of MLVSS
   maintained the low SVI. This indicates a lower dosage compared to batch
   tests, Mineral materials did not affect alkalinity, treatment
   efficiency, hoc size distribution or the amount of filamentous
   microorganisms. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microcosms were developed to determine the ability of microorganisms to
   degrade munition compounds such as TNT, dinitrotoluenes. nitrotoluenes
   and RDX from production wastewater. The largest percentage decrease of
   the nitroaromatic munition compounds was TNT with 76\% removed (8196 to
   1997 mu g/L) within the 45-day incubation period. A decrease in
   concentration from 10,629 to 679 mu g/L (94\%) was achieved for RDX in
   the same time period. The greater stability of the munition compounds in
   the sterile control microcosms indicated that the majority of munition
   compound loss was due to biological activity. The results suggest that
   the munition degrading microorganisms would at least be able to be used
   in a remediation strategy, should failure of the existing treatment
   systems occur. Further work would be required to determine the efficacy
   of replacing the existing treatment methods with a biological system.

Abstract = {{Olive mill waste-waters (OMWW) are a by-product of olive-oil production
   and a major environmental problem in the Mediterranean area. The use of
   a polyphenol-oxidase from olive husk is proposed for the enzymatic
   removal of low-molecular phenolics in OMWW. For comparison purposes, a
   purified microbial polyphenol-oxidase (Trametes versicolor laccase) was
   also employed. Though both enzymatic systems show relevant activity
   towards phenol polymerization, olive husk is much more appealing in view
   of possible applications because of its availability and extremely low
   cost, associated with excellent enzymatic activity and specificity. (C)

Abstract = {{Ultrafiltration is frequently used as a technique for size distribution
   measurement of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in natural waters,
   Concentrations of DOC in low molecular weight size classes may be
   underestimated if membrane rejection is neglected. A model was developed
   to improve the accuracy of size distribution measurements using an
   ultrafiltration technique. This model can be used for a large volume
   water sample, which is often required for trace element analysis in
   environmental samples. The model was applied to the size distribution
   analysis of DOC in water samples from the Florida Everglades and the
   results were in good agreement with that obtained using the model
   previously reported by Logan and Jiang. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Ozone inactivation rates for Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) oocysts
   were determined with an in vitro excystation method based on excysted
   sporozoite counts. Results were consistent with published animal
   infectivity data for the same C. parvum strain. The inactivation
   kinetics for C. parvum were characterized by a lag phase followed by
   pseudo-first order kinetics. Both the magnitudes of the lag phase and
   the pseudo-first order rate constant were found to be different for C.
   parvum oocysts from two different sources, and to obey Arrhenius law for
   the experimental temperature range of 5-30 degrees C. CT requirements
   for C. parvum inactivation were found to increase by an average Factor

Abstract = {{Samples of freeze-dried surface-lake brownwater (HO original), derived
   fulvic (FA) and humic acids (HA) and ultrafiltrate (K) which represent
   reference materials of a priority program of the German Research Council
   on ``Refractory Organic Substances in Waters{''} were investigated using
   py rolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS), Curie-point
   pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and, for the
   first time, Curie-pyrolysis-gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio
   mass spectrometry (Py-GC-C-IRMS). Py-FIMS of dissolved organic matter
   (DOM), FA, and HA gave highly reliable fingerprint mass spectra,
   thermograms describing the thermal properties and qualitative and
   quantitative data of 10 classes of characteristic molecular building
   blocks. Carbohydrates, phenols and lignin monomers; lignin dimers,
   lipids, alkylaromatics, aromatic nitrogen compounds, sterols, peptides,
   suberins and loosely bound fatty acids were determined. Complementary
   molecular structure information was obtained by Py-GC/MS which allowed
   the identification of a wide range of humic building blocks as main
   pyrolysis products. Our first results using the novel method of combined
   Py-GC/MS and Py-GC-C-IRMS indicate that the delta(13)C-values of the
   pyrolysis products are in agreement with generally accepted data for
   carbohydrates, lignin and benzenes from biological sources. This implies
   that the pyrolytical step does not have an isotopic effect. In contrast,
   some of the thermal products, e.g. 5-methyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde and
   benzenemethyl, had stronger depletions in C-13 in comparison to the mean
   delta(13)C-values of furans and benzenes, respectively. This result
   contradicts the enrichment of C-13 due to trophic effects and therefore
   suggests the incorporation of light carbon sources, such as respiratory
   CO2, methane, or anthropogenic pollution by fossil fuels, in the
   humification processes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Characterisation of soluble residual chemical oxygen demand (COD) in
   anaerobic wastewater treatment effluents}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Anaerobic wastewater treatment processes cannot usually achieve
   discharge levels of COD without some form of post-treatment due to the
   high levels of soluble residual COD in the effluent. However, there is
   very little information in the literature on the nature of this
   material, and hence the aim of this work was to characterise effluents
   from several different anaerobic processes by their: molecular weight
   (MW) distributions (using the techniques of ultrafiltration and size
   exclusion chromatography); biodegradability (both aerobic and anaerobic)
   and activated carbon adsorption characteristics. The MW distribution
   data indicated that the majority (up to 89\% w/w) of the material
   present in the effluents was in the low MW range (i.e. MW < 1 kDa),
   although there was a significant amount (up to 22\% w/w) in the high MW
   range (i.e. MW > 300 kDa). Differences in the distributions were
   observed according to reactor type, with effluents From anaerobic
   baffled reactors (ABRs) containing a higher proportion of high MW
   material than effluents From other reactor types. Aerobic degradation of
   the effluents was significantly more successful than anaerobic, despite
   the fact that the low MW material was found to be the most difficult to
   degrade aerobically. Activated carbon adsorption revealed that the low
   MW material was more difficult to adsorb than the high MW compounds. The
   data was fitted to Freundlich, Langmuir and BET isotherms and it was
   concluded that the Freundlich model was the most accurate for predicting
   removal efficiencies especially with regard to scale up. Some generic
   patterns emerged with respect to the characterisation of the effluents
   and these will assist in decisions regarding post-treatment.
   Nevertheless, in order for these generic patterns to be confirmed more
   work is needed on characterising effluent samples from anaerobic
   treatments. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A test of inhibition of microbial growth of activated sludge in a
   synthetic textile wastewater under the influence of various oxidants
   applied in the advanced oxidation process (AOP) pretreatment has been
   proposed. The inhibitory action of single constituents of the textile
   wastewater was determined in terms of effective concentration, EC50. for
   a dyestuff and two detergents employed. The most inhibiting component of
   the textile wastewater (EC50 = 28 mg dm(-3)) appeared to be
   anthraquinone dyestuff, while the surfactants seemed to be partly
   biodegradable (EC50 = 128 mg dm(-3) for the softening agent Tetrapol CLB
   and EC50 = 1700 mg dm(-3) for the anionic detergent Avivage KG
   concentrate). The application of AOPs prior to biodegradation showed
   that the most advisable AOP is the ozonation combined with UV radiation
   or the combination of O-3/UV/H2O2. The inhibitory effect of the AOPs on
   microbial growth during subsequent biodegradation of textile wastewater
   accounts for only 10\%, while untreated wastewater exhibits 47\% of
   inhibitory action. The applied biotest is one of the simplest methods of
   process optimisation of oxidant or radiation dose for the integrated
   chemical and biological oxidation of industrial wastewater. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Two source waters containing natural organic matter;(NOM) with different
   physical and chemical characteristics were crossflow-filtered using four
   types of membranes having different material and geometric properties.
   Transport measurements of NOM rejection and Aux decline were made. A
   resistances-in-series model was used to represent and quantitatively
   compare membrane flux decline and recovery. As anticipated, the
   resistance due to specific adsorption depended on the concentration at
   the membrane interface. For the two membranes showing evidence of NOM
   adsorption, reducing the initial flux (which we infer to also reduce the
   interfacial NOM concentration) also lowered the measured resistance
   assigned to adsorption in our protocol. Relative molecular mass (RMM)
   distribution measurements (by size exclusion chromatography) were used
   to calculate the average RMM of the NOM and persuasively illustrated
   that the nominal relative molecular mass cut-off(MWCO) of a membrane is
   not the unique predictor of rejection characteristics for NOM compounds.
   Size exclusion, electrostatic repulsion, and NOM aromaticity all
   influenced the NOM rejection. For a given wafer composition (including
   pH and ionic strength), membrane characteristics (such as the surface
   charge, hydrophobicity and nominal MWCO) can be combined with the NOM
   properties (such as total dissolved organic carbon, specific UV
   absorbance at 254 nm and humic content) to provide a consistent
   qualitative rationale for the transport results. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The solid/liquid separation in activated sludge plants is traditionally
   achieved by gravity sedimentation in secondary settling tanks (SST).
   Thickening data, used for the design of SST's is usually recorded by
   observing the descent of the sludge/supernatant interface vs batch
   settling lime, revealing the sludge sedimentation curve. To get
   information about the clarification process an experimental device to
   record the evolution of supernatant transparency during batch settling
   was set up. The curves gotten, revealed that different activated
   sludges, showing the same kind of sedimentation curve, can produce
   supernatant very different in suspended solids concentration. Two
   distinct types of separation behaviour exist, which are different in the
   way the supernatant clarification process is effected. For the first
   type the clarification of the supernatant is only due to a dilution of
   the supernatant by the expelled water which is filtered by flowing
   through the thickening biomass during batch settling. This behaviour is
   called ``cross-linked separation{''} because it only happens when the
   Aocs are linked to each other in an immobile structure. The other type
   of supernatant clarification is due to sedimentation of supernatant
   suspended solids. This behaviour is called ``disperse{''} separation
   because the Aocs are suspended as mobile individuals, thus they are
   disperse.
   Furthermore a more transparent layer, located directly above the
   solid/liquid interface was found and is explained. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Petroleum refinery wastewater containing polynuclear aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) are typically treated by biological processes in the
   United States. PAHs are recalcitrant, hydrophobic compounds and sorption
   to biological solids may be a significant mechanism for the removal of
   PAHs from refinery wastewater. The goal of this research was to
   investigate PAH sorption by bacterial biomass and examine the
   relationship between PAH biosorption and biodegradation. In this study,
   phenanthrene was used as a model PAH for biosorption studies and pyrene
   and fluoranthene were used as model compounds in biodegradation studies.
   It was found that phenanthrene biosorption varied with bacterial genus
   and species. Bacteria with the highest sorption capacity (K-P) belong to
   the Nocardioforms, organisms that often cause solids separation problems
   in activated sludge plants. Consequently, blooms of these difficult to
   settle organisms in refinery treatment plants could exasperate PAH
   releases to the environment. The measured sorption capacities were
   reproducible and appeared to represent surface sorption, based on the
   apparent competition between naphthalene and phenanthrene for sorption
   sites. Based on a comparison of K-P values, pure bacterial cultures can
   serve as valid models of biosorption by activated sludge MLSS. Finally
   it was found that PAH sequestration by high K-P, non-degraders has a
   significant impact on PAH biodegradation. The results of this study
   suggest that although biosorption can decrease the rate of PAH
   biodegradation in the short term, it can also result in the removal of
   PAHs from the wastewater and PAH retention in the treatment system where
   it may be ultimately biodegraded. This research improves our
   understanding of processes contributing to PAH degradation in petroleum
   refinery wastewater treatment plants. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In batch-experiments (in lab-scale fluidized bed reactors) the
   inhibition of acetate- and propionate-degradation by propionate
   (substrate inhibition) and the inhibition of propionate degradation by
   acetate (product inhibition) was studied. Various models were compared
   by fitting them to the experimental data. The importance of independent
   variation of the acid concentrations and the pH for the experimental
   design is discussed.
   The substrate inhibition was best described by a model of inhibition by
   undissociated acid with an additional independent pH influence. The
   inhibition by propionic acid was only slight in the practically relevant
   range of concentrations. However, the propionate degrading bacteria were
   sensitive against low pH.
   The product inhibition was best described with the model of competitive
   inhibition. The inhibition already occurred from an
   acetate/propionate-ratio of 1 upwards. A complete standstill of the
   propionate degradation at high acetate/propionate-ratios, as expected
   because of the proximity to the thermodynamic equilibrium, was not
   observed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to determine the influence of some chemical
   functional groups (COOH, phenolic-OH and organic nitrogen) and bulk
   parameters (UV 260 and DOC) on the trihalomethane formation potential
   (THMFP) of various treated industrial wastewaters. The samples were
   analyzed for UV 260, DOC, and THMFP. They were further fractionated into
   hydrophobic (humic) and hydrophilic (nonhumic) fractions using the XAD-8
   resin, then bulk and specific chemical functional groups were determined
   on both fractions. Regression analyses were carried out among the
   parameters analyzed with THMFP as the dependent variable.
   The hydrophilic fractions contained higher DOC and had larger
   contribution to the bulk THMFP compared to the hydrophobic fractions.
   Simple regression analysis showed that although UV 260 and DOC
   correlated better with THMFP, the correlation values obtained were not
   statistically significant. Correlations using bulk parameters as well as
   chemical functional groups taken one at a time could not predict THMFP.
   The parameters that influenced the formation of THMs based on a stepwise
   and multiple regression analyses were UV 260, organic nitrogen, and
   phenolic-OH in the nonhumic fractions (hydrophilic) and UV 260 and
   organic nitrogen in the humic fractions (hydrophobic). The estimated
   THMFP obtained from the equation derived from the statistical analyses
   correlated significantly with the observed values at 99\% level of
   confidence. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of Fenton's reagent pretreatment on the
   biodegradability of selected nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs) ethylene
   oxide/propylene oxide (EO/PO) block copolymers and a nonsurfactant
   compound polypropylene glycol (PPG) was examined. Chemical oxidation
   kinetic studies were conducted that showed that the Fenton reaction was
   rapid at the base conditions used (approx. 1000 mg/L COD 1000 mg/L H2O2,
   H2O2,/Fe-II molar ratio of unity) based on dissolved organic carbon,
   chemical oxygen demand, H2O2 and Fe-II removals. Batch aerobic bioassays
   were conducted to assess both the rate and the extent of
   biodegradability of the chemically preoxidized and unoxidized samples. A
   12-L sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was operated aerobically to provide
   acclimated biomass for use in the bioassays. EO/PO block copolymers,
   PPGs and (to a lesser degree) NPEs were found to be biorecalcitrant,
   that is, resistant to biomineralization. Advanced oxidation pretreatment
   using Fenton's reagent was highly effective at enhancing the
   biodegradability of EO/PO block copolymers and PPG. The biodegradability
   of NPEs, however; decreased with low oxidant dosages and increased with
   higher oxidant dosages. Economic estimates showed that chemical costs
   would comprise more than 90\% of the overall treatment costs for an
   integrated Fenton/activated sludge treatment system. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{The suitability of three filter materials (polycarbonate, cellulose
   acetate and glass fibre) for trace organic acids analysis (acetic,
   butyric, B-hydroxy-butyric, formic, lactic, maleic, methyl-succinic,
   malonic, oxalic, succinic and valeric) was tested by determining leached
   components and sorption/desorption properties. Analysis of the organic
   acids was made with capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE).
   Polycarbonate membranes were easily cleaned by leaching with Milli-Q
   water and showed limited adsorption of the acids. Cellulose acetate
   filters required a more elaborate washing before use and had a higher
   retention capacity. Glassfibre filters are not recommended due to severe
   contamination of organic compounds and release of colloids.
   Preservation of natural water samples (eutrophic, dystrophic) by
   addition of chloroform, sterile filtration and freezing (-20 degrees C)
   were quantitatively evaluated, after spiking with the organic acids (500
   mu g/1 each) and storing for 11 weeks.
   Freezing was the only treatment where the added acids were
   quantitatively recovered after 4 weeks. Sterile filtration in
   combination with storing of the samples in the dark at 4 degrees C can
   be suitable for short time preservation (less than 30 days). However,
   these conditions resulted in a high variation of recovered amounts among
   the replicates. Storing of untreated samples at room temperature or in a
   refrigerator, as well as addition of chloroform should be avoided. (C)

Abstract = {{Organic municipal solid waste (OFMSW) and two seed microorganisms,
   namely heat-pretreated digested sludge and hydrogen-producing bacteria
   enriched from soybean-meal silo, were varied according to a full
   factorial central composite experimental design with the aim of
   assessing the feasibility of hydrogen production from OFMSW. A simple
   model developed from the Gompertz equation was suitable for estimating
   the hydrogen production potential and rate. Through response surface
   methodology, empirical equations for specific hydrogen production
   potential and rate were fitted and plotted as contour diagrams in order
   to facilitate examination of experimental results. The contour plots
   showed that high hydrogen production potentials of 140 and 180 ml H-2.g
   TVS-1 occurred when the pretreated digested sludge and the
   hydrogen-producing bacteria consumed OFMSW, respectively. A high
   hydrogenic activity for the pretreated digested sludge (45 ml.g
   VSS-1.h(-1)) was obtained at a high food-ro-microorganism (F/M) ratio;
   however, that for the hydrogen-producing bacteria(36 ml.g VSS-1.h(-1))
   was found at a low F/M ratio. The experimental results showed that the
   hydrogen composition of the biogas was greater than 60\% except For
   initial incubation and no significant methane was found throughout this
   study. Further experiments confirmed that the results of this study were
   highly reliable and the OFMSW had a considerable potential on biological
   hydrogen production. Metabolic responses confirmed that characteristics
   of the heat-pretreated digested sludge converting the OFMSW into
   hydrogen were similar to that of anaerobic spore-forming bacteria of the
   genus Clostridium. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The AOC (assimilable organic carbon) method was used in this study to
   evaluate the biological stability of potable water. The potable water
   was drawn from a waterworks located in a petrochemical industrial area
   in China. Infrared spectra analysis was adopted in this study to examine
   the relationship between treatment process and organic compounds in
   water. By monitoring the AOC concentration in groundwater, potable water
   and the effluent of each treatment process (biological pretreatment,
   ozonation, GAC adsorption), the following were noted: (1) a considerable
   AOC concentration could still be detected in potable water after
   advanced treatment processes, such as ozonation and activated carbon
   adsorption. Relatively poor biological stability was also noted in the
   potable water; (2) GAC was the most effective process with a total AOC
   removal efficiency of more than 80\%. The corresponding biotreatment
   removal efficiency was only 45\%. However, ozonation yielded a negative
   overall removal efficiency of -119\%; (3) while biological pre-treatment
   and GAC adsorption contributed towards a biologically stable water,
   ozonation yielded oxidation products which were biologically unstable.
   Ozonation, if used, should therefore be combined with the GAC or
   biological processes. Treatment processes (like ozonation) which
   increased the amount of organics in carbonyl group would likely lead to
   poor product water biological stability. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this paper a study is made of the biodegradability of a non-ionic
   surfactant, a nonylphenol polyethoxylate, in river water by means of
   monitoring the residual surfactant matter and the metabolites that may
   be generated. The influence of temperature on the extent of primary and
   ultimate biodegradation, and the kinetics of degradation are also
   determined.
   The method used was the river die-away test, and the biodegradation
   process was monitored by normal and reversed phase high-performance
   liquid chromatography (HPLC). These results are supported by other
   indirect measurements and indicators of the existence of microbial
   degradation process, as well as the parameters for the control of the
   process.
   The results obtained indicate that temperature has a strong influence on
   the period of acclimation of the microorganisms and on the rate of
   biodegradation. The percentages of primary biodegradation vary from 68\%
   at 7 degrees C to 96\% at 25 degrees C, and at all the temperatures
   studied, metabolites are generated during the biodegradation process
   which do not totally disappear at the end of the assay. The percentages
   of mineralization reached in the various assays, ranging from 30\% at 7
   degrees C to 70\% at 25 degrees C, also show the great influence of
   temperature.
   Finally, a kinetic study of the biodegradation process has been carried
   out, with excellent fit of the experimental data to the kinetic model of
   Quiroga and Sales. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Some experimental results have already reported on a biological
   activated carbon (BAC) process to show its effectiveness of the
   treatment of a kind of wastewater collected from plating industries, in
   which refractory organic pollutants and small amounts of heavy metal
   ions existed after physical-chemical treatment. However, the removal
   behavior of the organic pollutants in the BAC treatment under the
   existence of inhibitors, such as heavy metal ions, was not made clear,
   Therefore, some laboratory-scale experiments were performed using some
   types of model wastewater. The organic substances chosen as the target
   pollutants were typical commercial reagents used in plating industries.
   The influence of some inhibitory factors. such as concentrations of
   heavy metal ions, pH and salt concentrations on the removal of organic
   substances in the BAC treatment was examined. As a result, it was found
   that the activated carbon adsorption decreased the inhibition of
   coexisting heavy metal ions, while the ratio of the inhibition was not
   reduced by use of activated carbon when salt concentrations or pH values
   were varied, In addition, different levels of inhibition ratio appeared
   as different organic substances were treated and it was Found thar less
   biodegradable organic substances tended to be affected by heavy metal
   ions acting as inhibitors. A proposed index, (BOD/COD)/(q/q(0)), could
   express some relationships with the magnitude of inhibition and with the
   removal efficiency of the organic pollutants under the conditions that
   the heavy metal ions coexist. Also, the possibility of this approach for
   examinations to evaluate various kinds of treatments was suggested. (C)

Abstract = {{Models of transport and pollutant dispersion are routinely used to
   define risks posed by contaminants present in aquatic environments.
   Modelers frequently utilize a simple parameter, known as a partition
   coefficient, to apportion contaminant concentrations between dissolved
   and particulate phases. But the inherent uncertainty in the master
   variables for partition coefficients (distribution coefficient (Kd);
   particulate matter concentration) is also a source of uncertainty in
   model results. We demonstrate an approach that can be used to quantify
   this source of uncertainty and apply it to an investigation of the
   transport of radionuclides away from a radioactive waste site in a
   shallow Arctic Bay. Our investigation considers the radionuclides,
   americium, plutonium, europium, ruthenium, cobalt, cesium, and strontium
   which exhibit a broad range of affinities for marine particles.
   Probability distribution functions were constructed for radionuclide
   distribution coefficients (K-d) and particulate matter concentrations
   using Beta-Pert functions. Simulations using Latin Hypercube sampling
   were performed on the Functions of Kd and particulate matter to define
   probability functions of partition coefficients for each radionuclide.
   These distributions were used in a hydrodynamic model of Abrosimov Bay
   to predict ranges of radionuclide concentrations for different
   atmospheric forcing events. From this investigation, partition
   coefficients values (PC,) exhibit the highest uncertainty for
   radionuclides having mid-range Kd values (K-d = 1-30 m(3)/kg). When
   applied to model simulations of radionuclide transport, concentrations
   of less particle-reactive radionuclides, strontium (K-d = 0.01 m(3)/kg)
   and cesium (K-d = 0.3 m(3)/kg), are most sensitive to variations in wind
   direction and hence to water exchange rates. Whereas europium (K-d = 100
   m(3)/kg), ruthenium (K-d = 30 m(3)/kg) and cobalt (K-d = 1 m(3)/kg)
   concentrations exhibit large variations in response to different
   combinations of partition coefficient values and wind events. Even high
   Kd radionuclides such as americium (K-d = 1000 m(3)/kg) exhibit large
   uncertainties in dissolved concentration when simulating low sediment
   concentrations for the bay. Generalizing these findings, the uncertainty
   in the master variables used to calculate partition coefficients is
   significant for all but the most soluble contaminants. The method
   described in this paper can be a useful tool in radionuclide transport
   modeling for quantifying this uncertainty. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{As the second phase of a large-scale Tulane University Mississippi River
   water-qualify database project, nutrient data on the lower Mississippi
   River have been examined for potential differences among sampling
   agencies, geographic locations and chemically similar nitrogen
   parameters. These data represent the most comprehensive source of
   information on nutrients in the Mississippi River available as a single
   database. Monthly means, grouped by parameter, sampling location and
   agency, were calculated and compared as paired sets, excluding months
   where data were not available for both sets. Evaluations using ANOVA
   indicated few differences among agencies providing nitrogen-compound
   data, although differences were observed in phosphorus-compound data
   from different sources. Unfiltered and filtered fractions of
   nitrate-nitrite were found to be comparable throughout the study area.
   Spatial examination of the nutrient data indicated few differences in
   inorganic nitrogen concentrations throughout the study area, but
   significant variability in total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN). Orthophosphate
   and total phosphorus concentrations increased through the study area
   from Arkansas {[}river miles (RM) 500-810] downstream to St.
   Francisville (RM 231-315), bur with little or no change from Baton Rouge
   (RM 111-230) to the Gulf of Mexico. Results provide a combined data set
   From which preliminary calculations of daily nutrient loads in the
   Mississippi River between 1960 and 1997 were conducted. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The apparent chemical and inactivation reactions taking place during the
   disinfection of Escherichia coli with ozone in the presence of humic
   acid were investigated with continuous-flow tubular reactors. The
   apparent decomposition of dissolved ozone in the presence of humic acid
   and E. coli cells was modeled successfully with mixed second-order rate
   expressions within a time scale relevant to E. coli inactivation with
   ozone. The rate for the ozone inactivation of E. coli in the presence of
   humic acid was slower than that in the absence of natural organic matter
   due to the faster decomposition of dissolved ozone and thus the lower
   exposure of E. coli cells to the disinfectant in the former case.
   However, the second-order inactivation rate constant was approximately
   the same in the presence and absence of humic acid confirming that
   molecular ozone rather than radicals was the species generally
   responsible for inactivation. The overall rate of reaction between ozone
   and organic matter associated with E. coli cells was slower that the
   rate of E. coli inactivation by ozone. Only 25\% of the initial
   relatively fast ozone demand were satisfied by the time that practically
   all micro-organisms present in solution were inactivated. TEM
   micrographs revealed that noticeable changes in the interior of E. coli
   cells did not take place until most of the cells present in the sample
   were non-viable. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anaerobic leachate polluted groundwater samples were collected
   downgradient of a Danish landfill. The groundwater samples were spiked
   with heavy metals at concentrations within the range of metal
   concentrations found in landfill leachates (100 mu g Cd l(-1) 500 mu g
   Ni l(-1), 1000 mu g Zn l(-1), 1000 mu g Cu l(-1) and 1000 mu g Pb l(-1))
   and divided under anaerobic conditions: into colloidal
   (screen-filtration and cross-flow ultrafiltration), organic
   (anion-exchange) and dissolved inorganic species of the heavy metals.
   The distribution of the heavy metals between the different size-fl
   actions showed that a substantial, but highly varying part of the heavy
   metals was associated with the colloidal fractions (Cd: 38-45\%, Ni:
   27-56\%, Zn: 24-45\%, Cu: 86-95\%, Pb: 96-99\%). These colloidal bound
   metals were furthermore associated primarily with the organic fraction,
   except for Zn, which was associated mainly with the inorganic fractions
   Dissolved Cd, Cu and Pb were mainly associated with dissolved organic
   carbon, while Ni was also present as carbonate complexes and Zn as
   carbonate complexes and free divalent Zn. Most of the metals present in
   the colloidal fractions would have been sampled as dissolved if the
   commonly used filter size of 0.45 mu m had been used, since very little
   metal was found in colloids larger than 0.40 mu m (Pb < 15\%, Cd < 10\%,
   Zn < 5\%, Ni and Cu < 1\%). The results indicate that heavy metals in
   leachate-polluted groundwater are strongly associated with Small-size
   colloidal matter and organic molecules. The behavior of heavy metals in
   the environment is thus expected to differ from that of truly dissolved
   heavy metals. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd, All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simulation study with the scope to optimise the
   plant design and operation strategy of 2-reactors alternating activated
   sludge processes with only flow schedule and aeration on/off as control
   inputs. The methodology is to simulate the application of receding
   horizon optimal control (RHOC) to a range of different plant designs
   within this class of systems and select the combination of design and
   operation strategy with the best performance. Subsequently a simple
   feedback controller is designed that closely imitates the optimal
   operation strategy. Starting-point is the plant layout with maximal
   degree of freedom within the above-mentioned class (Fig. 1), which is
   commercially available under the name BIODENITRO(TM). The simulation
   results indicate that in the optimal combination of plant design and
   operation strategy the performance in terms of nitrogen removal improves
   significantly as compared to current practice, especially if a shorter
   cycle length is used. In the optimal process design the two reactors are
   placed in series, the first reactor is about four times as large as the
   second one. The possibilities of feeding influent to reactor 2 and
   withdrawing effluent from reactor 1 are redundant. A conceptually simple
   feedback controller (OSCAR, operating a series connection of two
   alternating reactors) is presented that straightforwardly implements the
   improved operation strategy. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Subsampling of the concentrated sample pellet resulting from the
   information collection rule (ICR) method for detection of
   Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts is often required to
   facilitate the terminal microscopy step. Variability in counts of
   (oo)cysts in subsamples suggests that sampling error may occur as a
   consequence of subsampling and subsequent partial analysis of this
   pellet. Variability is modeled hers as a Poisson distribution and is
   incorporated into a model that accounts for other uncertainties in the
   detection procedure. The result is to greatly expand confidence
   intervals (CI) around reported concentrations. For example, the 90\% CI
   around the concentration reported based on detection of one (oo)cyst in
   a pellet subsample is increased nearly threefold when sampling error
   arising from partial sample analysis is added to other potential sources
   of variability. Consideration of a distribution in which (oo)cysts are
   clumped, such as a negative binomial distribution, further increases
   uncertainty, producing confidence intervals ranging over several orders
   of magnitude. The relevance of the uncertainty arising from partial
   sample analysis to risk assessment is demonstrated. For example, to
   produce water with an acceptable 1 in 10,000 risk of infection, the
   level of water treatment prescribed may increase from 3- to 4.5- for
   greater log removal of(oo)cysts. Implications of this additional
   uncertainty in the ICR method on reported (oo)cyst concentrations argue
   for expanded reporting procedures to include an indication of the
   uncertainties associated with reported concentrations and/or
   improvements in the detection method. (C)! 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Electron-beam (EB) radiation technology was applied to the Kimpo coastal
   landfill leachate to treat the biologically refractory substances
   remaining after an activated sludge process. Kimpo landfill leachates
   were analyzed in terms of molecular weight distribution (MWD) and
   aquatic humic substances (AHS) before and after the activated sludge
   process and EB radiation. When the raw leachate with an initial BOD of
   1370 mg/l was treated by the activated sludge process, about 98\% of BOD
   was successfully removed during the 72-h batch test. However, the
   biodegradability of leachate, defined as BOD/DOC, decreased from 1.3 to
   0.1 due to the presence of biologically refractory organic matter.
   Fractionation of organic matter using an ultrafiltration apparatus
   revealed that large organics. above MW 30,000, were the most refractory
   component. However, this high organic component was sharply reduced
   after EB radiation. The AHS of the raw leachate and the effluent from
   activated sludge process (AS(eff)) were estimated to be 57.7 and 64.1\%
   of DOG, respectively. When the AS(eff) was subjected to EB radiation at
   a dose of 30 kGy and pH 3, DOC concentration decreased from 324 to 215
   mg/l and AHS content also fell from 68.6 to 52.9\%. The efficiency of EB
   radiation was affected by pH condition and dose. In the case of
   AS,(eff), pH condition was the most important parameter affecting the
   efficiency of EB radiation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Toxic effects of organic pollutants and their fate in anaerobic
   acidogenic systems have not been studied extensively despite the
   potential of acidogenic treatment to be an efficient and economical
   pretreatment process. The objective of this paper was to study the
   toxicity and fate of pentachlorophenol (PCP) in an acidogenic,
   glucose-degrading anaerobic enrichment system. Chemostat cultures
   (1.5-day SRT) were acclimated to 21-59 mu M (6-17 mg/l) PCP for 159-261
   days. Up to 121 mu M (35 mg/l) PCP allowed greater than 99.5\% influent
   glucose removal in chemostats. but serum bottle experiments showed that
   these PCP concentrations partially inhibited glucose degradation In
   contrast to the control, the test chemostats with PCP showed Formation
   of lactate and ethanol with lower acetate concentrations.
   Hydrogen-utilizing methanogens were inhibited by 21-121 mu M (6-35mg/l)
   PCP. No biodegradation of PCP was observed even in acclimated cultures.
   Even with significant removal of PCP in both and serum bottles,
   chlorophenol intermediates were not found, and batch experiments showed
   that such chlorophenol intermediates, if formed, would have undergone
   little degradation. Extraction of PCP in serum bottles showed sorption
   to biomass was the dominant mechanism for PCP removal in acidogenic
   cultures. Hence, contrary to expectations, the usefulness of anaerobic
   acidogenic cultures for degradation of PCP could not be substantiated.
   Further research on factors stimulating PCP degradation by
   nonmethanogenic anaerobes is necessary. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Along with conventional chemical analyses, biological assessment is
   useful for monitoring water quality. Biochemical markers are early
   warning systems of the exposure of aquatic organisms to pollutants.
   Among them, the measurement of fish EROD induction is used as an
   appropriate tool in numerous field studies. Yet, in a large scale
   biomonitoring perspective, it is necessary to rank results from field
   sites.
   Cyprinids were thus sampled in the Rhone river watershed (France) in
   relatively clean acid polluted areas. Reference baseline EROD activities
   were calculated for two species: chub and gudgeon. The data from the
   polluted sites were related to contamination and female sexual maturity.
   With all results, a classification of the EROD levels was proposed
   through statistical analysis of the characteristics of the EROD
   distribution. The decision rule was based on type I (false positive)and
   type II (false negative) error rates.
   Both measurement and interpretation of the EROD biomarker are then
   advanced enough to begin a normalisation procedure in biomonitoring and

Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2690-2700}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of the present study is to investigate the
   bioaccumulation of trace metals (Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr, Pb, Ni) in the
   polycultured fish. A series of eight ponds (Au Tau pond system) were
   constructed at Au Tau Fisheries Officer Hong Kong Agriculture and
   Fisheries Department. Polluted river water was pre-treated in the first
   four. ponds by providing sedimentation (S1, S2) and aeration (Al, A2),
   the effluent from A2 was introduced into the remaining four ponds
   (C1-C4) for fish culture. Fries of six species of freshwater fish
   including silver carp, big head, grass carp, tilapia, common carp and
   black bass were stocked in the ponds (C1-C4) during 11/93-2/94 and 1/4
   of normal fish food (peanut cake) was used in the fish ponds. Bimonthly
   sampling of fish was conducted from 3/94-1/95 and trace metal
   concentrations in fish flesh and viscera were examined. In addition, the
   distribution of trace metals in different components of the fish pond
   ecosystem was also investigated.
   The results showed that bioaccumulation of trace metals occurred in the
   organisms at the lower levels of the foodweb and no biomagnification was
   detected at the upper levels, except for Cu concentrations in mosquito
   fish. The results revealed that metals in viscera were allometric,
   negatively correlating with body length (p < 0.05) (excluding Zn in the
   viscera of common carp), which suggested that metal metabolism in fish
   played an important role in metal accumulation in fish viscera.
   Comparisons of trace metal concentrations in the viscera of the fish
   were therefore conducted by Student's t-test with body size as the
   covariant and the results suggested that higher metal contents in the
   food led to higher metal accumulation in the viscera. Zn accumulation in
   common carp was different from that in other species, with the highest
   Zn accumulation in viscera and in flesh. More than 60\% of variations of
   Zn concentrations in fish flesh could be explained by Zn concentrations
   in fish viscera and fish body length according to the regression
   analysis (p < 0.001) (common carp excluded) but no such relationships
   were detected for other metals (Cu, Cd, Cr). Significantly higher
   concentrations of trace metals were obtained in the viscera of the
   polycultured fish than those in the flesh, which suggested that viscera
   played an important role in storing trace metals in fish. When compared
   with trace metal contents reported in other studies, the present study
   demonstrated similar values and the fish (flesh) cultivated in the
   treated wastewater seemed to be safe for human consumption, in terms of
   trace metal concentrations. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Giardia and Cryptosporidium are important waterborne parasites. Thirteen
   water samples and 32 fecal specimens were collected from the Kau-Ping
   River and its watershed to test for Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium
   oocysts. The detection methods are immunofluorescence assay and
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for water samples and fecal specimens,
   respectively. Seven out of eight samples collected from raw water
   samples showed the presence of cysts, while six out of eight raw water
   samples contained oocysts. Cryptosporidium was present in 40\% of the
   treated water, while Giardia occurred in all of them. Four out of 32
   fecal specimens, collected from the hog farming region, tested positive
   for Giardia, and seven specimens tested positive for Cryptosporidium.
   Giardia was related only to Cryptosporidium but not to the others. (C)

Abstract = {{A modified version of IAWQ activated sludge model 2 (ASM 2) was
   developed to address the long-term dynamic behavior of nutrients in a
   sequencing batch reactor (SBR) activated sludge process. Experimental
   data was obtained from a long-term experimental work carried out in a
   100-1 bench scale SBR. Changes in TOC, NH4-N, NO3-N, NO2-N and PO4-P
   could be reliably predicted after the model parameters were adapted to
   the SBR conditions. Better phosphorus dynamics were achieved by
   considering the sub-model of denitrification by phosphorus accumulating
   organisms (PAO). Long-term simulations were carried out with the
   calibrated model to investigate the behavior of N and PO4-P under
   disturbed loading conditions. After attaining sufficient biological
   phosphorus removal activities in the sludge, influent TOC concentration
   was stepwise decreased and increased for 5 weeks, nle decrease in
   organic loading caused the deterioration of biological phosphorus
   removal with simultaneous increase in effluent NO3-N concentration
   Subsequently increasing the organic loading restored the original
   effluent conditions. The model simulation predictions well match with
   the experimental results under disturbed organic loading conditions. The
   simulated results implied that the deteriorating phenomena of phosphorus
   removal can be explained by two mechanisms: poor P-uptake by PAO and
   washout of PAO itself. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Polyhalogenated compounds are known to resist aerobic degradation but
   are subject to anaerobic reductive dehalogenation. The anaerobic
   biotransformation often result in the accumulation of toxic and
   carcinogenic compounds. An example is the production of
   trichloroethylene (TCE), cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (cDCE),
   trans-1,2-dichloroethylene (tDCE), 1,1-dichloroethylene (1,1-DCE) and
   vinyl chloride (VC), from anaerobic dechlorination of
   tetrachloroethylene (PCE). However, the anaerobic dehalogenation
   products are known to be susceptible to aerobic methanotrophic oxidative
   mineralization. Therefore, the treatment of polyhalogenated compounds
   and field remediation of sites contaminated by these compounds involve
   anaerobic biotransformation followed by aerobic mineralization;, As
   opposed to two stage treatment and remediation which involve anaerobic
   environment followed by an aerobic environment in two separate systems
   or environments, recent focus on the detoxification of polyhalogenated
   compounds involve the development of engineering systems which can
   accomplish anaerobic biotransformation and aerobic oxidative
   mineralization in a single reaction environment. Periodic aerated
   anaerobic batch systems, including systems far ex-situ and in-situ
   biodetoxification of polyhalogenated compounds are being developed at
   San Jose State University under the direction of Dr Udeme J. Ndon. These
   systems and results of preliminary studies are presented in this report.
   Results of the preliminary experiments showed minimum accumulation of
   PCE biotransformation products in comparison to strict anaerobic
   conditions. Results also show that PCE degradation may have occurred
   during the transition between anaerobiosis and aerobiosis. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Samples of stormwater runoff from three sawmills on Vancouver Island BC,
   were tested for acute toxicity with juvenile rainbow trout. All except
   one of the 27 samples tested exhibited toxicity. Causes of toxicity were
   investigated using toxicity identification evaluation techniques;
   specifically, treatment with the chelating agent EDTA. Toxicity was
   attributed to divalent cations, particularly zinc, in 24 of these
   samples. The very low hardness associated with most of the samples
   increased the potential for metals toxicity. Zinc toxicity showed a
   strong dependence on hardness, with a range of LC(50)s of 72-272 mu g/L
   between hardnesses of 9-100 mg/L. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Distribution of trivalent iron has been measured in riverine materials
   from a tropical hydrosystem (Nyong basin, South Cameroon, central
   Africa). The speciation and the respective amounts of the iron species
   have been determined using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy
   on freeze-dried samples separated by ultrafiltration. Trivalent iron
   occurred mainly in two forms, linked to organic matter (Fe-OM) and as
   iron oxides. Ln the Nyong, Fe occurred mainly as oxides (82\%), while in
   the Mengong, a minor river, it was mainly linked to organic matter
   (64\%). This indicates that iron in suspended matter results from
   mechanical erosion in the main Fiver and from chemical erosion in the
   minor river. Moreover, the similar size distribution of Fe-OM in both
   rivers suggests a conservative inheritance of organics-mediated
   transport of iron in the hydrographical network. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the effects which temperature and the initial
   chlorine concentration have on the chlorine decay in different water
   samples. It also reports the derivation of empirical formulae which
   describe these effects. The data show that chlorine decays more rapidly
   in fresh samples than in those which had been re-chlorinated with sodium
   hypochlorite to give a concentration of about 0.5 mg/1. The decay
   constants were found to be inversely proportional to the initial
   chlorine concentration in the former case and to the concentration added
   in the latter case. A combined first and second-order model is described
   which describes the decay more precisely than the conventional
   first-order model. Specifically, it shows that the chlorine decay is
   influenced by its initial concentration and explains why chlorine decays
   more rapidly in the initial stages. It also explains why the decay
   constant in the first-order model varies with the initial chlorine
   concentration. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2747-2756}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Five species of freshwater fish including black bass (Micropterus
   salmoides), tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus), big head (Aristichthys
   nobilis), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and grass carp
   (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) cultured in a wastewater system were used to
   study the bioaccumulation of DDTs, HCHs and PCBs. The wastewater system
   comprised of eight ponds. After sedimentation (ponds S1-S2) and aeration
   (ponds A1-A2), the treated wastewater was used for fish culture (ponds
   C1-C4).
   p, p'-DDT and HCHs were undetectable in all the samples. When comparing
   the levels of DDTs and PCBs in the sediments of the inlet (S1) and
   outlet (C4) of the system, about 58\% of DDTs and 85\% of PCBs were
   removed (based on the concentration of DDTs and PCBs in S1 as 100\%)
   after sedimentation and aeration. Black bass contained the highest (p <
   0.05) levels (lipid based) of both DDTs (0.76 mu g/g) and PCBs (3.4 mu
   g/g), followed by tilapia (DDTs: 0.090 mu g/g and PCBs: 3.1 mu g/g),
   grass carp (DDTs: 0.087 mu g/g and PCBs: 2.1 mu g/g), silver carp (DDTs:
   0.038 mu g/g and PCBs: 1.6 mu g/g) and big head (DDTs: 0.040 mu g/g and
   PCBs: 0.87 mu g/g). The homologue pattern of PCBs varied between fish
   species. There were marked differences in average chlorine numbers
   between fish species with different feeding habits, and the average
   chlorine numbers observed in fish muscle were 3.5 for grass carp, 4.5
   for big head, 4.8 for silver carp, 5.0 for black bass and 5.2 for
   tilapia. These results indicated that feeding habits intervened in the
   PCBs accumulation process. Higher contents of PCBs and chlorine number
   were found in black bass which located in the highest trophic level. (C)

Abstract = {{A dynamic mathematical model of prefermentation is presented.
   Prefermentation is becoming an increasingly popular unit operation in
   biological nutrient removal wastewater treatment plants. The aim of the
   prefermenter model is to provide a tool for optimisation of prefermenter
   design and operation. Model assumptions. equations and parameters are
   detailed. The major specification for the prefermenter model is that it
   is relatively simple, but can still describe the effects of the main
   design and operating parameters on volatile fatty acid (VFA) production
   in prefermenters. The model is verified by comparing its prediction with
   experimental data presented in the literature. Predicted and measured
   steady-state effluent VFA, soluble COD and ammonia-N concentrations are
   compared for varying hydraulic and solids residence times. The
   correspondence between experimental data and model prediction is good.

Abstract = {{Laboratory-scale batch experiments were conducted for a purr culture of
   Acinetobacter sp. aiming to develop a kinetic model for the aerobic
   growth of the bacterium under phosphate and carbon-limited conditions.
   The ability of the bacterium to take up more phosphorus than is normally
   needed for cell growth and store it intracellularly as polyphosphate was
   verified. A sufficiently accurate kinetic model, describing the
   behaviour of the bacterium under polyphosphate- and carbon-limited
   anaerobic conditions, was then developed. The transient characteristics
   of batch cultivation systems with Acinetobacter sp, cells to changes
   from anaerobic to aerobic conditions and vice-versa wore studied in the
   sequel and an appropriate integrated kinetic model was developed. The
   model describes adequately the dynamic behaviour of the poly-P bacterium
   under strictly anaerobic, strictly aerobic and transient conditions.
   Model predictions were validated with batch experiments conducted under
   transient aerobic/anaerobic conditions. Acinetobacter sp. cells
   presented a rapid adaptation ability to either aerobic or anaerobic
   conditions during shifting from one environment to the other. Batch
   experimentally observed profiles of biomass growth. acetate consumption
   and phosphorus uptake and release were found to be in excellent
   agreement with the predicted ones by the overall kinetic model. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The capability of the simple carbohydrate, glucose, to stimulate aerobic
   biodegradation of cis-dichloroethylene (cis-DCE) was tested using a
   river sediment. Greater reductions in cis-DCE were observed in aerobic
   microcosms incubated with glucose than in either killed controls,
   bottles incubated with oxygen and no glucose, or bottles containing
   glucose and no oxygen. Two aquifer sediments from different geographic
   locations also showed similar trends in dichloroethylene reduction. A
   sediment-foe transfer culture from the original river sediment was
   further tested for cis-DCE degradation. Results indicate that cis-DCE
   losses coincide with an increase in chloride.ion concentration. The
   increase was equivalent to the amount of chloride that would be expected
   from the measured reduction in dichloroethylene and the release of two
   chlorides per cis-DCE. The possibility that methanotrophic or
   ammonia-oxidizing bacteria mediated dichloroethylene destruction was
   eliminated, because the sediment-free suspension culture showed no
   evidence of either activity. Hence, it appears that a new type of
   activity mediated the observed dichloroethylene transformation. The
   implications of these results on ill situ bioremediation of
   chloroethylenes are discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Bromate removal by activated carbon after ozonation in a subject of
   concern, since bromate is commonly found in the ozonation of
   bromide-containing water. Though new GAC (granular activated carbon)
   shows the capacity to reduce bromate to bromide, n the long-term use of
   GAC following ozonation, its bromate removal rate apparently decreases
   during transition from new GAC to BAC (biological activated carbon)
   after 3 months. Batch bromate reduction experiments using new GAC and
   BAC confirmed new GAC's ability and BAC's inability to reduce bromate to
   bromide. Our experiment also indicated that ion exchangeable bromate
   adsorption on new GAC was very limited. Based on the results of our
   long-term experiment, the bromate removal rate during the transition
   from new GAC to BAC was calculated: 1.5 mg BrO3/g carbon when bromate
   concentration was 50 mu g/l. BAC's inability to reduce bromate makes it
   necessary to optimize ozonation conditions to minimize the formation of
   bromate and other by-products while maintaining target levels trf
   organic matter decomposition. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study examined the mechanism and kinetics of surface catalyzed
   hydrogen peroxide decomposition and degradation of contaminants in the
   presence of land collected from an aquifer and a riverbed. Batch
   experiments were conducted using variable sand concentrations (0.2 to
   1.0 g-sand/ml solution) and phenol and quinoline as model contaminants.
   Inhibition and probe studies were conducted to ascertain the role of
   several oxygen radicals (e.g.(OH)-O-., (HO2)-H-./O-2(-)) on contaminant
   degradation. Phenol degradation products were consistent with reaction
   with hydroxyl radical. Concordant with this, phenol degradation was
   greatly inhibited in the presence of the widely accepted hydroxyl
   radical scavenger butanol. Additional inhibition studies with superoxide
   dismutase (SOD) support the conclusion that superoxide anion
   participates in the formation of hydroxyl radical. It is postulated that
   the relatively long-lived superoxide anion is capable of leaving the
   vicinity of the sand surface into bulk solution, where it may react with
   hydrogen peroxide to form hydroxyl radical and contribute to contaminant
   degradation. A mechanism is formulated and evaluated which accounts for
   these observations, as well as hydrogen peroxide decomposition kinetics
   and the complex decay behavior of phenol and quinoline in the presence
   of sand. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{When cupric and zinc ions existed at relatively high concentrations (100
   ppm each) in the aqueous media, a Na-alginate solution can be directly
   dispensed into the aqueous media (initial pH: 2.6-5.4) circulating in a
   loop fluidized-bed reactor to produce spherical alginate gels in situ
   that contain both Cu and Zn. An extended Langmuir model for two
   adsorbates competing for the same type of binding sites was tested
   against batch absorption data obtained with these gels. Conditional
   binding stability constants for Cu-alginate and Zn-alginate and binding
   capacity of the alginate were obtained from the proposed model for each
   initial pH. Selectivity calculated as the ratio of the stability
   constant of Cu-alginate to that of Zn-alginate was found to be about 10.

   2.6-5.4. Binding group density and binding stability constants of
   alginic acid, cupric alginate and zinc alginate were obtained
   simultaneously by fitting data to the proposed model developed in this

Abstract = {{Irgarol 1051,
   (2-methylthio-4-tert-butylamino-6-cyclopropylamino-s-triazine), is a
   newly developed herbicidal additive for use in copper-based antifouling
   paints. It is intended as replacement for the highly toxic antifouling
   agent tributyltin, which has been regulated internationally. Currently,
   there is no information in the open literature on its environmental
   occurrence outside Europe. A two-year survey was conducted in 1996-1997
   to investigate the occurrence of Irgarol 1051 in Canadian and Japanese
   aquatic environments. Six large trade ports (Vancouver, Toronto,
   Montreal, Halifax, Mizushima and Kobe), 73 marinas and 13 fishery
   harbors were surveyed. Irgarol 1051 was not detected in the Canadian
   aquatic environment, but was positively identified in the enclosed
   coastal waters of the Sere Inland Sea in Japan. Among the six trade
   ports surveyed, only the Mizushima Port had low levels of Irgarol 1051,
   up to 19.5 ng/L. Approximately 27\% of the marinas surveyed in the Seto
   Inland Sea were found to have been contaminated by Irgarol 1051, ranging
   in concentration between 12.5 and 264.2 ng/ L. Irgarol 1051 was found
   more frequently in fishery harbors than in marinas, indicating that
   besides marinas and trade ports, fishery harbors can also be a
   significant source of contamination for the aquatic environment. Survey
   for Irgarol 1051 in the fishery harbors has not been reported before,
   and it is suggested that fishery harbors, in addition to ports and
   marinas, should be included in the survey list during the Irgarol 1051
   monitoring study. Irgarol 1051 has been reported to be highly toxic to
   nontarget marine algae with the observable growth inhibition at a
   concentration as low as 50 ng/L, which is well within the ambient
   concentration levels found in some localities of the Seto Inland Sea.

Abstract = {{This paper investigates several potential applications of a recently
   developed dynamic mathematical prefermenter model. Three case studies
   are presented. In the first case study, the model is used to analyse and
   optimise the performance of a prefermenter. The full-scale complete-mix
   prefermenter in Penrith. Australia. is used as an example. The model
   call predict the optimal residence time with respect to maximal mass of
   volatile fatty acids and soluble COD produced per day.
   The second study focuses on the effect of different feed types on
   prefermenter performance under different operating conditions. Four
   different feed types are defined for this case study, the main
   difference being their total COD concentrations. According to the
   simulation results, in-line prefermenters should generally be operated
   at a longer solids residence time than side-stream prefermenters for
   maximal rates of volatile fatty acids production. Optimal hydraulic
   retention limes predicted by the model are considerably lower than what
   is currently used in practice for side-stream prefermenters.
   In the third case study the model is used to predict the dynamic
   behaviour of a prefermenter after a sudden disturbance. Experimental
   results from a pilot-scale activated primary tank undergoing dynamic
   transients and the corresponding simulation results are shown. The
   disturbances were initiated by adding glucose to the feed and by a step
   change in hydraulic residence lime. The three case studies illustrate
   that the prefermenter model is a versatile tool for optimising the
   design and operation of prefermenters. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title = {{Effects of oxygenation and upflow liquid velocity on a coupled
   anaerobic/aerobic reactor system}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2855-2863}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{By supplying a small amount of oxygen to a UASB (upflow anaerobic sludge
   bed) reactor and thereby supporting aerobic metabolism in an otherwise
   anaerobic environment, a coupled reactor system was evaluated at a
   laboratory scale. In order to determine the optimal delivery of oxygen
   to the coupled reactor systems, two principal operating variables were
   investigated: the oxygenation rate and the liquid recycle rate. Two UASB
   and four coupled reactor systems, each 1 litre and operated continuously
   at a one day hydraulic residence time (HRT) at 35 degrees C, we .e
   employed in order to meet these objectives.
   The oxygenation rate increased the dissolved oxygen concentration to a
   maximum of 2.9 mg/L and the redox potential up to -9 mV (E-h). Methane
   was formed even under these conditions, indicating that the aerobic and
   facultative microorganisms limited the O-2 penetration and maintained a
   reduced microenvironment which was necessary for the methanogens to
   function. Oxygenation substantially decreased the methane yield and the
   ratio of methane:carbon diol;ide in the biogas. Oxygenation also led to
   a decrease in the mean particle size of the biomass and lower volatile
   suspended solid (VSS) levels retained in the reactors. Liquid
   recirculation aided in maintaining a low redox potential. In spite of
   the effects of the increased upflow velocity removing the smaller
   diameter biomass particles from the reactors, more biomass was retained
   in the reactors at these higher liquid flow rates.
   No significant impact of oxygenation could be observed on the specific
   anaerobic activities of the granules, up to the oxygenation mid-range.
   High oxygenation levels, obtained by combining both high aeration
   (highest flow of pure O-2) and higher liquid recycling rates are
   necessary to substantially impair the methanogenic activity. Crown

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to evaluate several multivariable model-based
   control algorithms for controlling nitrogen removal in activated sludge
   processes, We contend that the control of nutrient removal in activated
   sludge systems is a multivariable control problem, rather than a
   multiloop problem. The work is a simulation study of a
   predenitrification activated sludge plant. Several model-based
   controllers are evaluated and compared against a base-case and multiloop
   controller. We introduce a quantitative measure to aid in controller
   evaluation. Model based control algorithms are shown to be able to
   provide tight control of N removal, thereby offering significant
   benefits in terms of deferred capital expenditure. This is in return for
   increased operating costs. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study examined practical performance of a submerged membrane

   Treated water was filtered through flat microfiltration membrane modules
   (polyethylene; pore size 0.4 mu m) by the pressure head of bulk
   solution. A combined aerobic/anaerobic (single-sludge) system was used
   to enhance nitrogen removal. Operation was continued for 491 days. From
   the 267th to the 324th day of operation, seasonal inflow fluctuation was
   simulated by increasing inflow by 1.5- to 3-fold. The obtained results
   were summarized in the following four points. (1) Membrane filtration
   was able to be continued for the first 371 days without membrane washing
   and was still stable after the washing. (2) Average removal ratios of
   BOD, TOC, SS, total nitrogen, total phosphorsus and coliform bacteria
   were 99, 93, 100, 79, 74\% and 6-log units, respectively. (3)
   Experiments on simulated inflow fluctuation showed that the system could
   cope with a short-term fluctuation of inflow (up to threefold) without
   deteriorating filtration performances significantly. (4) Average power

   for guidelines}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2201-2217}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In Mediterranean environments, uneven distribution of precipitation and
   runoff spacially and temporarily. requires the construction of costly
   water storages and higher levels of wastewater treatment. Also, uneven
   occupation of the territory leads to a significant stress in coastal
   areas and requires the diversion of significant volumes of water. In
   most Mediterranean countries, the main problem may not be scarcity of
   water in terms of average per capita. but the high cost of making water
   available at the right place, at the right time with the required
   quality. In these countries, more than anywhere else, an integrated
   approach for water resources management including wastewater reclamation
   and reuse locally is required. As a result, and following a general
   increase in wastewater treatment, wastewater reclamation and reuse is
   expected to increase sharply in the Mediterranean basin over the next
   decade and become an important aspect of integrated water resources
   management. Important projects are being developed and wastewater
   reclamation and reuse facilities have been built. These projects have
   followed local or national guidelines where available such as for
   example in Israel. France, Tunisia or Cyprus. Regulations on wastewater
   reclamation and reuse are essential, They help protect public health,
   increase water availability, prevent coastal pollution and enhance water
   resources and nature conservation policies. Unifying wastewater
   reclamation and reuse regulations around the Mediterranean basin would
   also contribute to secure economic and touristic exchanges in the
   region. However, there is still a controversy between the defenders of
   strict water quality standards for an absolute protection of public
   health and the defenders of a pragmatic stance recognizing existing
   wastewater reuse practices and promoting non-potable water uses with
   less restrictive water quality standards. Despite the high potential for
   wastewater reclamation and reuse in the Mediterranean countries, only a
   few have systematically exploited this resource. This paper presents the
   status of wastewater reclamation and reuse around the Mediterranean
   basin and discusses existing guidelines and regulations. The possibility
   of developing uniform wastewater reuse standards is also presented, (C)

Abstract = {{The atypical mycobacteria or nontuberculous mycobacteria differ from
   tuberculous mycobacteria (M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. africanum)
   because most of them are ubiquitous and saprophytic. A few are
   considered potential human pathogens: M. avium, M. intracellulare, M.
   chelonae, M. kansasii, M. marinum, M. fortuituma and M. ulcerans. The
   immunological status of a person determines the advance of disease.
   disseminated or localizated (lung disease, lymphadenitis. skin or soft
   tissue involve ment). Over the last decades the incidence of
   mycobacteriosis has increased in account of Sida. M. avium-M.
   intracellulare complex (MAC) are predominant species. In contrast to M.
   tuberculosis per son-to-person transmission does not occur with
   nontuberculous mycobacteria. These bacteria are ubiquitous and may be
   found in the environment especially in water. It is difficult to isolate
   mycobacteria from nature thus published results certainly under estimate
   reality. Several studies indicated that the fluctuation in the
   occurrence of environmental mycobacteria was in relation to chemical and
   physical characteristics of the water: pH. ions concentration,
   temperature, organic matter.
   Among water species, scotochromogen M. gordonae or M. flavescens are the
   most common. Rapidly growing species M. fortuitum or M. chelonae are
   also common water contaminants. On account of their resistance to
   decontaminating agents they cause abscesses or postsurgical infections.
   M. marinum, isolated from aquariums or swimming pools, is the agent of
   inflammatory cutaneous nodules. M. kansasii, M. xenopi are especially
   found in drinking water distribution, they are responsible for pulmonary
   diseases. The majority of human mycobacteriosis are due to species of
   the complex MAC which are isolated more frequently in warm water.
   Epidemiologic studies suggest that natural or drinking water are the
   principal source of human contamination. Recently results obtained using
   molecular biology techniques as pulsed field gel electrophoresis
   demonstrated a relation beta een environmental and human species. The
   eradication of nontuberculous in water is not possible so preventive
   measure could be a good strategy to limit mycobacteria. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{An unconfined floodplain aquifer near Missoula, MT, was instrumented
   with 89 monitoring wells and 20 four-port multilevel samplers. Bromide,
   bacteriophages MS2. PRD1 and null setX174 and the attenuated
   enterovirus, polio virus (type-1 CHAT strain), were seeded into the
   aquifer as slug injections. Bromide transport rates ranged between 22-29
   mid. Input concentrations of the tracers and the placement of monitoring
   wells limited detection of bromide and polio virus to 19.4 m and the
   detection of three bacteriophage to 40.5 m downgradient from the
   injection point. After 7.5 m of transport, the calculated relative
   attenuations {[}Harvey R. W and Garabedian S. P. (1991) Env. Sci. Tech.
   25, 178-185] for MS2, PRD-1, null setX174 and attenuated polio virus
   were 49. 71, 65 and 99\%, respectively. During the 72-h experiment,
   die-off was negligible (less than 1\%) and attachment of virus to
   sediment surfaces resulted in the overall differences in bromide and
   virus behavior. Although relative attenuations at downgradient
   monitoring wells indicated that the virus tracers were attaching to
   aquifer material along the flowpath, virus peaks arrived at observation
   wells at rates similar to the bromide peak. The high collision
   efficiency of the attenuated polio virus resulted in breakthrough curve
   truncation. Natural attenuation of slug input virus over a ``typical{''}
   sourer-supply set-back distance of 30.5 m would most likely not reduce
   virus concentrations to proposed acceptable risk levels in this or a
   similar cold-water high-velocity groundwater system. (C) 1999 Published

Abstract = {{An alum water treatment residual ({''}sludge{''}) was conditioned by
   freezing at ultra-rapid rates. Ultra-rapid rates were obtained by
   freezing on liquid nitrogen. The purpose of the experiments was to
   determine the conditions necessary for such rapid freezing to improve
   dewaterability. Contrary to results reported in the literature,
   ultra-rapid freezing worked extremely well. Although the conditioned
   flocs ({''}zots{''}) were not as dense or granular as obtained at slower
   freezing rates, dewaterability was still greatly improved.
   Dewaterability, as measured by cake solids content (CSC), capillary
   suction time (CST), filterability coefficient (chi) and aggregate volume
   index (AVI), was best for samples with an initially high solids content
   and for samples that had been cured or stored at sub-freezing
   temperatures, for long times. Zot size analyses showed that tots
   decreased in size following ultra-rapid freezing. The results are
   explained using a proposed conceptual model of the residuals freezing
   process. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hazardous organic compounds have previously been identified in landfill
   leachates. The emissions of the organic compounds with leachates from
   landfills are dependent, among other processes, on the water transport
   through the landfill and the sorption of the compounds to the waste. The
   purpose of this study was to examine the transport of organic compounds
   with percolating water through a pilot scale landfill. The pilot-scale
   landfill was constructed at an actual landfill site and contained 540
   m(3) of ordinary household waste. Leachate collecting devices were
   placed at three levels. Lithium was used as a water tracer and was
   applied, together with specific organic compounds, at the top of the
   landfill, The waste was then irrigated with 10 mm of water per day, and
   leachate samples were collected and analyzed weekly. It was concluded
   that significant amounts of the water were percolating with preferential
   Row paths through the landfill, together with fractions of the organic
   compounds. II was also Found that organic compounds transported in
   preferential flow paths were retained by sorption, but that the sorption
   did not reach equilibrium. It was suggested that preferential flow paths
   and organic compound sorption non-equilibrium should be taken into
   account when, for example, modelling landfill emissions. The results are
   applicable to the estimation of environmental risks From landfill
   leachates and for the evaluation of landfills as a treatment method for
   waste. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The variable nature of wet weather flow events has made it difficult to
   assess the toxicity of these events with conventional toxicity testing
   methods. This paper proposes a test protocol that includes an
   event-focused toxicity test method, a corresponding test metric that
   more accurately represents the toxicity of brief exposures, and an
   event-based index that describes the acute toxicity of wet weather
   events. This testing protocol is designed to quantify toxic response
   produced by brief contaminant exposures (<24 h), as well as time-varying
   contaminant exposures, which are typical of wet weather events. The
   protocol describes the use of an event-focused toxicity test to
   determine a PELET50 (post-exposure lethal exposure time for 50\% of the
   population) metric for individual event samples. The PE-LET50 is a new
   metric that represents the exposure duration to a sample necessary to
   produce a 50\% response during a post-exposure observation period. The
   protocol then describes the development of an index that integrates the
   toxicity of event samples (PE-LET50s) into a measure of total event
   toxicity. This index is the event toxicity unit (ETU). The development
   and use of the test protocol is described and results are provided from
   single and multiple sequential exposures to reference toxicants and from
   two wet weather discharge events. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Oxidation reaction rate parameters for molecular ozone (O-3) and
   hydroxyl (HO) radicals with a variety of hydrophobic organic acids
   (HOAs) isolated from different geographic locations were determined from
   batch ozonation studies. Rate parameter values, obtained under
   equivalent dissolved organic carbon concentrations in both the presence
   and absence of non-NOM HO radical scavengers, varied as a function of
   NOM structure. First-order rate constants for O-3 consumption (k(O3))
   averaged 8.8 x 10(-3) s(-1). ranging from 3.9 x 10(-3) s(-1) for a
   groundwater HOA to > 16 x 10(-3) s(-1) for river HOAs with large
   terrestrial carbon inputs. The average second-order rate constant
   (k(HO.DOC)) between HO radicals and NOM was 3.6 x 10(8) l(mol C)(-1)
   s(-1); a mass of 12 g C per mole C was used in all calculations.
   Specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) at 254 or 280 nm of the HOAs
   correlated well (r > 0.9) with O-3 consumption rate parameters, implying
   that organic pi-electrons strongly and selectively influence oxidative
   reactivity. HO radical reactions with NOM were less selective, although
   correlation between k(HO.DOC) and SUVA existed. other physical-chemical
   properties of NOM. such as aromatic and aliphatic carbon content from
   C-13-NMR spectroscopy, proved less sensitive for predicting oxidation
   reactivity. than SUVA. The implication of this study is that the
   structural nature of NOM varies temporally and spatially in a water
   source, and both the nature and amount of NOM will influence oxidation
   rates. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The potential for microbial growth in drinking waters is considered to
   be associated with the content of easily assimilable organic carbon
   (AOC). The bacterial test for the determination of the AOC concentration
   presumes that microbial growth in the test is limited by the
   availability of organic carbon. However, in the northern latitudes
   inorganic nutrients, particularly phosphorus, may limit the microbial
   growth in drinking waters. In our studies, addition of an inorganic
   nutrient mixture (N, P, K. S. Ca. Mg) to soft, humus-rich drinking
   waters increased the AOC yield in most of the drinking waters. The
   assimilable organic carbon determined with the addition of nutrients
   describes that pool of organic carbon potentially available for
   microbial growth (AOC(potential)). The AOC yield when there is no
   without addition of inorganic nutrients describes that part of organic
   carbon (AOC(native)) which bacteria can utilize in the prevailing
   conditions and it is composed of the availability of both organic
   substrates and inorganic nutrients. We found that the bacterial strains,
   Pseudomonas fluorescens P 17 and Aquaspirillum NOX, used in the
   standard, AOC method, can also be applied in humus-rich drinking waters.

Abstract = {{In a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) granules of aerobic heterotrophic
   microorganisms were cultured. The effect of different operational
   conditions on the formation of these aerobic granules were studied. The
   time allowed for settling was the main parameter to select for growth of
   bacteria in well settling granules. Both a short HRT and a relative high
   shear were found favorable for granulation. A substrate loading rate of
   7.5 kg COD/(m(3) day) was applied. This Ted to formation of granules
   with an average diameter of 3.3 mm and a biomass density of 11.9
   gVSS/l(granule). Based on microscopic observations a hypothesis for the
   granulation process was formulated. The reactor was started up without
   any carrier material present. At the beginning filamentous fungal
   pallets dominated the reactor. These pellets functioned as an
   immobilization matrix in which bacteria could grow out to colonies.
   After a certain rime the fungal pellets fell apart due to lysis in the
   inner parr of the pellets, the bacterial colonies could now remain in
   the reactor because they were large enough to settle sufficiently Fast.
   These colonies further grew out to granules. This paper shows that
   granule formation in aerobic reactors is feasible and can be exploited
   to increase the volumetric conversion capacity of such reactors. (C)

Abstract = {{Nitrate utilisation rate (NUR) batch tests with wastewater and acetate
   as carbon sources were carried out. A pulse dosage of wastewater to
   activated sludge in anoxic conditions enables to distinguish the
   denitrification rates on subsequent wastewater fractions and to
   determine the concentrations of readily (Ss) and slowly biodegradable
   COD (Xs). The anoxic substrate utilisation rates of Ss and X-S under
   anoxic conditions can be calculated. Using mentioned parameters the
   overall denitrification rate can be modelled as a function of the anoxic
   sludge loading rare in the predenitrification volume. The
   denitrification potential of the wastewater, defined as the amount of
   nitrate which can be reduced with the biodegradable GOD-fractions in the
   influent and endogenous denitrification potential allow to calculate the
   denitrification potential of the treatment plant and to predict the
   nitrate effluent quality. If the denitrification potential of the plant
   is not sufficient the addition of an external carbon sourer has to be
   considered to enhance the denitrification. In this study, batch NUR
   tests with acetate were carried out to extract process kinetics, The
   relation between the obtainable denitrification rate and the anoxic
   sludge loading rate san be used to design the rate of dosage of acetate
   and can be a base for developing control strategies. In ail
   denitrification NUR batch tests a precaution should be taken concerning
   accumulation of nitrite and biological phosphorus removal activity. The
   possible transfer of the results to full-scale treatment plants is
   discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The sensitivity and the reliability of two bt viro genotoxicity tests
   were compared: the Jaylet test (or the newt micronucleus test) and the
   micronucleus test in xenopus. The Jaylet test is now a French standard
   method for testing genotoxicity in water, whereas the micronucleus test
   in xenopus was set up much more recently. Xenopus does, however, have
   certain practical advantages over the pleurodele.
   The study involved two phases, in the first we assessed the ability to
   detect the genotoxicity of five pure substances (selected for their
   environmental interest) added to the rearing water, and in the second we
   used the tests to evaluate genotoxicity of five effluents of urban and
   industrial origin.
   Three of the five tested substances (carbendazim, potassium chromate and
   cadmium chloride) were positive in the micronucleus test in xenopus but
   negative in the Jaylet test. One of these substances was positive with
   the Jaylet test but not with the micronucleus test in xenopus (pyrene).
   One substance (bis(tributyltin)oxide) gave negative results in both
   micronucleus tests.
   Only two of the five wastewaters were genotoxic with the Jaylet test:
   wastewater from a built-up area and effluent from a cokery. The effluent
   From a chemical plant was positive prior to the treatment stage. These
   two effluents give a positive response with the micronucleus test in
   xenopus. Wastewaters from the steel factory and the chemical plant were
   negative with the Jaylet test, but genotoxic to xenopus tadpoles. (C)

Abstract = {{A dynamic kinetic model for the advanced oxidation process (AOP) using
   hydrogen per oxide and ultraviolet irradiation (H2O2/UV) in a completely
   mixed batch reactor (CMBR) is developed. The model includes the known
   elementary chemical and photochemical reactions, and literature reported
   photochemical parameters and chemical reaction rate constants are used
   in this model to predict organic contaminant destruction. Unlike most
   other kinetic models of H2O2/UV oxidation process, the model does not
   assume that the net formation rare of free radical species is zero
   (pssudo-steady state assumption). In addition, the model considers the
   solution pH decrease during the process as mineral acids and carbon
   dioxide are formed. The model is tested by predictine the destruction of
   a probe compound, 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP) in distilled water
   with the addition of inorganic carbon. The new model developed in this
   work gives better predictions of the destruction of the target organic
   compound than the model based on the pseudo-steady state assumption. The
   model provides a comprehensive understanding of the impact of design and
   operational variables on process performance, Accordingly the ability of
   the model to select optimum process variables, such as hydrogen peroxide
   dosage, is illustrated. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Influence of factors affecting the removal of chlorine and chlorination

Abstract = {{The addition of an ozonation step followed by a second stage biological
   activated carbon (BAC) filtration to a conventional treatment
   (coagulation-flocculation, settling and sand-anthracite filtration) has
   been identified as a good mean for controlling chlorination by-product
   precursors. Lately, the addition of an ozonation step before filtration
   and the replacement of sand-anthracite filtration by sand-BAG filtration
   has been proposed as an economical solution when retrofitting treatment
   plants. The accumulation of flocs and particulate matter in first stage
   sand-BAG filters may cause nevertheless some problems of substrate or
   oxygen diffusion to the biomass fixed on the BAG.
   The main objectives of this study were to verify the impact of
   flocs/particle accumulation in first stage sand-BAC filters by: (1)
   studying the effects of filter backwash on the removal of chlorination
   byproduct precursors; (2) comparing the efficiency of sand-BAG
   filtration with that of first stage sand-anthracite filtration and
   second stage BAC filtration.
   Figure 1 shows the flow; chart of the pilot facilities used for this
   study. The raw water, from the Mille-Iles River, was settled in the St.
   Rose filtration plant (nominal capacity of 110,000 m(3)/d). This settled
   water was then pumped to the pilot plant (nominal capacity of 48 m(3)/d)
   where it was ozonated in two sequential ozone reactors. The ozonated
   water stream was then split by open weirs to three filtration trains.
   Four pilot filters were used: two replicate first stages and-BAC filters
   (filtres sable-CAB \#1 and sable-CAB \#2), one first stage
   sand-anthracite filter (filtre SA) followed by one second stage BAC
   filter (filtre CAB). Table 1 shows the design and the operational
   parameters of the filters. Properties of filter media are described in
   Table 2. Table 3 shows additional sampling information.
   Analytical monitoring included chlorine demand, dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC), ammonia, hexane extractable disinfection by-product precursors
   (HEDBPp) and haloacetic acid precursors (HAAp). Table 5 indicates the
   HEDBPp and the HAAp measured. All these parameters were measured on
   water samples taken at different filter depths according to empty bed
   contact time (EBCT).
   Results showed that floc and particle accumulation in first stage
   sand-BAG filters impaired the removal of some chlorination by-product
   precursors, such as HAAp which are considered to be easily
   biodegradable. Fortunately, biter backwash restored these removals.
   Chloropicrin precursors were also identified as being easily removed in
   biological filters when compared to the biodegradation kinetics of
   dissolved organic carbon. Chloroform and trichloropropanone precursors
   were found to be removed as the global pool of dissolved organic carbon.
   The replacement of first stage sand-anthracite filter by sand-BAG filter
   and the addition of an interozonation step could improve the quality of
   the water produced by the treatment plant. In fact, this study showed
   that sand-anthracite filtration was not suitable for the removal of
   chlorine demand, chloroform precursors, chloropicrin precursors and
   trichloropropanone precursors. Furthermore, the water quality of the
   effluent of first stage sand-BAG filtration and of BAG filtration was
   shown to be very similar. However, the coagulation-floculation step must
   be enhanced in a manner to prevent the accumulation of Aocs and
   particulate matter in first stage sand-BAG filters. Results also
   suggested that the potential of removal of biodegradable precursors of
   chlorination by-products is limited and should be part of a global
   strategy including the optimisation of natural organic matter removal by
   other treatment processes (coagulation, settling, membranes). (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Tritium routinely released as low-activity liquid radioactive waste by
   the Asco nuclear power plant (Tarragona, Spain) was used as a
   radiotracer to study the hydrodynamics of the Ebro river (north-eastern
   Spain) lower course. In coordination with the plant, a field experiment
   was carried out in which, after a tritium release, water was sampled
   downstream from nine locations along the river at periodic intervals.
   Tritium was measured with a low-background liquid scintillation system
   and the concentration time evolution for each location was obtained. In
   order to study the river hydrodynamics, the one-dimensional
   advection-diffusion equation was used to determine the longitudinal
   dispersion coefficient and mean velocity of Ebro river waters.
   Experimental data were fitted using an analytical, a box-type and a
   numerical model to solve the equation. For the studied river discharge,
   namely 220 m(3) s(-1), the longitudinal dispersion coefficient ranged
   from 67 +/- 20 to 294 +/- 36 m(2) s(-1) and the mean water velocity
   ranged from 0.575 +/- 0.002 to 0.710 +/- 0.014 m s(-1), depending on the
   sampling point. From the analysis of the longitudinal dispersion
   coefficient it was observed that this river section shows three zones
   with different hydrodynamics which largely depends on the river
   morphology. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-flow ultra-filtration from the Rio Negro basin (Amazon) samples
   was undertaken with tangential flow equipment producing concentrated
   fractions on which UV-fluorescence produced information about the
   individual characteristics of the organic matter in different size

   fluorescence were both linearly (r>0.95) correlated with total organic
   carbon (TOC) determined at each individual station. The physico-chemical
   characteristics (fluorescent sensitivity and electro-mobility) of the
   organic carbon seem to be constant within each size fraction
   (particulate, colloidal and dissolved). The complexing capacity of
   copper was found to be elevated, with as consequence that more than 80\%
   of the metal transport occurred in the dissolved phase. By comparing
   these various results, we have deduced that the functional groups
   responsible for complexation are not the same as those responsible for
   fluorescence and conductance. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   strongly depended on temperature. The role of substrate storage for
   microbial population dynamics and resulting SVI is discussed. The SVI
   strongly increased with an increased temperature. The results are
   discussed in the context of the kinetic selection theory of Chudoba et
   al. {[}Chudoba, J., Grau, P. and Ottava, V. (1973) Control of activated
   sludge filamentous bulking. II. Selection of microorganism by means of a
   selector. Water Res. 7, 1389-1406.]. From this it becomes evident that
   the formation of storage polymers should be considered as equally
   important as the direct competition for substrate based on affinity
   constants. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A protocol was developed to rapidly assess the efficiency of chemical
   washing for the removal of excess biomass from biotrickling filters for
   waste air treatment. Although the experiment was performed on a small
   scale, conditions were chosen to simulate application in full-scale
   biotrickling filters. From 18 treatments with different combinations and
   concentrations of chemicals, only washing with 0.4\% (w/v) NaOH, 0.26
   and 1.31\% (w/v) NaClO and 11.3\% (w/v) H2O2 resulted in a biomass
   removal significantly higher than treatment with pure water with wet
   biomass removal efficiencies of 50.2, 49.2, 77.0 and 69.0\%,
   respectively. Biomass removal by H2O2 and NaClO was accompanied by
   complete loss of activity of unremoved biomass, whereas after treatment
   with NaOH low residual biological activity was observed. However,
   treatment with NaOH resulted in generation of relatively large amounts
   of suspended solids (22.3\% of dry biomass removed) and dissolved carbon
   (65.3\% of C-biomass removed). NaClO was found to be the most promising
   reagent for biomass control in biotrickling fillers because of its
   ability to remove large amounts of biomass and its low cost. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The effects of changing wastewater composition and SRT on an anaerobic
   mixed population were modelled and compared with the results from
   continuous degradation studies of a lactic, butyric, propionic and
   acetic acid containing wastewater. Particular attention was paid to the
   population dynamics in the membrane-coupled anaerobic pilot-scale
   reactor, with population data provided by in situ hybridization
   techniques. The microbial community structure was characterized using
   fluorescent, ribosomal RNA targeted oligonucleotide probes specific for
   Bacteria, Archaea and phylogenetically defined groups of methanogens and
   sulfate-reducing bacteria. Specific cell counts were determined by a
   combination of in situ hybridization and epifluorescence microscopy. The
   anaerobic population was dominated by Archaea belonging to the genus
   Methanosaeta, whereas sulfate-reducing bacteria were monitored to a less
   extent.
   The mathematical model was successful in simulating organic substrate
   degradation, pH in the reactor, liquid-gas transport of gaseous products
   and the long-term development of the anaerobic consortia. In the model
   the microbial population was grouped into substrate-specific organisms
   and compared to the measured amounts of acetogenic and methanogenic
   cells. At high SRT the hybridization data underestimated the actual
   number of active cells in the system. With the new technique of in situ
   hybridization and mathematical simulation promising tools were combined
   which help to understand the complex interactions in anaerobic mixed
   populations and the influence of reactor operational modes. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The adsorption ability of Cu(II) using chitosan from simulated rinse
   solutions containing chelating agents was studied. Four chelating agents
   including ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), citric acid, tartaric
   acid and sodium gluconate were selected. It was shown that the
   concentration ratio of chelating agent to Cu(II) as well as the NaOH
   concentration significantly affected the adsorption capacity.
   Competition between coordination of Cu(II) with unprotonated chitosan
   and electrostatic interaction of Cu(II) chelates with protonated
   chitosan played an important role in this adsorption system. The maximum
   adsorption capacity was found within each optimal pH range. This work
   provided a simple criteria for adsorption removal of Cu(II) from such
   industrial rinse solutions (0.3-5.0 mol/m(3)) using chitosan. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{We analysed the benthic macroinvertebrate species composition, taxonomic
   richness (as expected richness for 100 individuals), total abundance and
   biomass at 117 stream sites in the province of Dalarna. Partial least
   squares regression models were constructed from observations on
   undisturbed sites and used to predict these community parameters at
   sites exposed to elevated levels of copper, zinc, lead and cadmium
   resulting from leakage from old mine deposits. Species richness at
   undisturbed sites was positively related to the size of the catchment,
   pH, channel width. calcium concentration and the proportion of deciduous
   trees in the riparian zone. In streams with elevated metal
   concentrations, we found reductions in taxonomic richness for total
   macroinvertebrates, mayflies, stoneflies and combined EPT
   (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera). but not fur that of
   Trichoptera nor total abundance or biomass. Copper and zinc were those
   metals showing strongest negative associations with richness. Some
   ta,va, common at undisturbed sites, were missing at metal-polluted
   sites, These taxa were the mayflies Ameletus inopinatus, Ephemerella
   aurivilli and Heptagenia dalecarlica, the stonefly Protonemura meyeri
   and the caddisfly Apatania sp. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The sediment/water (K-d) and octanol/water (K-ow) equilibrium
   partitioning coefficients have been investigated for volatile
   chlorinated and monocylic aromatic hydrocarbons in the 2 to 25 degrees C
   temperature range. The equilibrium partitioning in closed systems
   (EPICS) method has been optimized to measure both equilibrium
   partitioning coefficients. Sediment/water equilibrium partitioning for a
   riverine sediment (organic carbon fraction 4.12\%) proved to increase
   with increasing temperature, showing changes in enthalpy between 2.5 and
   12.8 kJ.mol(-1) A statistical approach showed that for 5 our of 12
   compounds investigated this temperature dependence is significant at
   alpha = 0.05.
   Next, the temperature dependence of the octanol/water equilibrium
   partitioning was investigated for 8 compounds. The octanol/water
   equilibrium partitioning coefficients increased with increasing
   temperature for all compounds, except for toluene. Changes in enthalpies
   of this process proved to be between -1.0 and 5.2 kJ.mol(-1) However,
   the temperature dependence of this process was statistically not
   significant (alpha = 0.05).
   The log K-d-log K-ow relationship showed correlation coefficients
   between 0.89 and 0.90 at 2.3, 6.2, 18.6 and 25.0 degrees C (n = 8).
   Slopes of the linear regression increased with increasing temperature.
   This was explained by the higher temperature dependence of
   sediment/water equilibrium partitioning process for compounds with
   higher K-d coefficients. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Excessive input of nutrients of human origin renders Mediterranean
   coastal lagoons eutrophic. In this study, the sediments from a coastal
   lagoon were exposed to different phosphate loads under oxic and anoxic
   conditions in a batch reactor. Phosphate and;iron mobility were measured
   in the water and sediment phosphate was fractionated. Under oxic
   conditions, pH variations changed the distribution of phosphate in the
   sediment. At pH = 6, a calcium bound phosphate mobilization was Found by
   the dissolution of this fraction, while the liberate phosphate became
   iron-bound. A part of phosphate adsorbed onto the iron hydroxides was
   transferred to organic fractions when pH changed from 7 to 8. Under
   anoxic conditions, iron hydroxides are responsible for some release of
   phosphate. The redox potential necessary to obtain this release
   decreased with an increase in pH: release occurred at pH 7 and -50 mV,
   at pH 8 and -100 mV and at pH 9 and -150 mV. Oxic conditions induced
   phosphate uptake from sediments. Such oxic conditions can be restored
   quickly in the sediments after an anoxic period. In contrast,
   restoration of anoxic conditions is slow.
   Thus, decreasing phosphate inputs can induce sediment phosphate release
   into the water under appropriate redox and pH conditions. This mobility
   of phosphate is discussed in the coastal lagoons context. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Algal species distribution has frequently been correlated with pH and
   metal concentrations in streams contaminated by acid mine drainage. To
   determine if pH or metal is more influential in algal distribution,
   laboratory experiments were performed using two species of a filamentous
   green alga (Ulothrix) common in streams receiving acid mine drainage.
   Algae were exposed in acute toxicity tests to buffered growth media at
   various controlled pH levels and combinations of Mn and Ni
   concentrations. The growth of both species was affected by Mn and
   unaffected by pH levels typical of those in contaminated streams. Our
   results support the concept that metal concentration may be more
   influential than pH in determining algal distribution in streams
   receiving acid mine drainage. Also, we have identified a buffer that may
   be useful for algal toxicity tests since the buffer was resistant to
   daily pH drift, allowed formulation of a wide pH range and enabled
   vigorous growth of the algal species tested. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to make a contribution to the knowledge of
   inhibition by heavy metals of both nitrifying and heterotrophic bacteria
   in the activated sludge, based on measurements of ammonium uptake rats
   (AUR) and oxygen uptake rate (sOUR) activities. For the inhibition
   tests, we used different concentrations of the following heavy metals:
   Cd2+, Cr6+, Cu2+, Pb2+ and Zn2+, and the toxic effect of each metal was
   measured after 1 and 24 h exposure. Tests were performed on activated
   sludges from a full-scale nitrifying plant. The inhibitory
   concentrations were evaluated for each ion and in a decreasing order of
   toxicity two groups were found: Cd > Cu > Zn and Pb > Cr. Nevertheless,
   experimental results indicated that the response of AUR and sOUR to the
   tested metals was different. Higher AUR values than sOUR ones were
   observed in the tests with Cd2+, Cu2+ and Pb2+ indicating a lower
   sensitivity of nitrifiers to these heavy metals in comparison with
   heterotrophs. Inhibitory effects of Cr6+ and Zn2+, were quite similar on
   both AUR and sOUR activity. Our results suggest that in nitrifying
   activated sludge plants the sOUR test can be used better than AUR test
   to identify possible inhibitory effects of heavy metals from wastewater.

Abstract = {{Electroporation is a process whereby the treatment of cells with short
   pulses of electrical energy enhances the permeability of the cells
   towards external solutes. In this study we report on the kinetics with
   which this permeability enhancement can assist with the inactivation of
   Giardia muris cysts by free chlorine. Cysts in buffer and in partially
   treated surface water were treated with combinations of electroporation
   and disinfection. Different electroporation and disinfection conditions
   were used. From these data, we were able to develop a modified Hom model
   to describe the data. Under the conditions investigated, electroporation
   was able to reduce the chemical doses required for cyst inactivation,
   although it had little or no intrinsic inactivation activity. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The activated sludge process (ASP) can be successfully integrated into

   The role of microalgae in the ASP was elucidated and biological

   flocculation by the production of exopolysaccharides (EPS) under stress
   conditions. Superior flocculation appears to result in a greater

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1781-1790}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Among the various causes of chlorine consumption in drinking water
   distribution networks, corrosion has not been so far seriously
   considered. This work focused on the corrosion study of cast iron, as a
   representative material of those networks, by both electrochemical
   methods (steady-state curves, corrosion potential and electrochemical
   impedance data) and classical photograph observations in the absence and
   in the presence of chlorine. From impedance results and photographs, a
   scheme of the different corrosion products layers, that is based on the
   de Levie's theory, is proposed. By fitting this physical model to
   experimental impedance diagrams, the anodic charge transfer resistance
   can be extracted and thus a reliable value of the corrosion rate can be
   given. The general conclusion is that free chlorine is not
   electrochemically consumed at the metal surface though it is more easily
   reducible than oxygen. Therefore, the corrosion of cast iron pipes
   induces only a chemical decay of chlorine corresponding to its reaction
   with ferrous ions released by iron dissolution and the: total
   consumption rate is exactly obtained from the corrosion current density.

Title = {{Formation of interim by-products in methanogenic degradation of butyrate}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1791-1798}},

Abstract = {{The formation of interim by-products during the methanogenic degradation
   of butyrate was monitored and analyzed in this study. Two series of
   experiments were conducted at various butyrate concentrations and under
   the influence of increased partial pressure of hydrogen (P-H2). In all
   batches, acetate was found most abundant in the mixed liquor, accounting
   for over 52-83\% of carbon in the original butyrate. This confirms that
   the degradation of butyrate was through acetate by beta-oxidation, and
   the rate of butyrotrophic acetogenesis was considerably higher than that
   of acetotrophic methanogenesis. Assuming the degradation followed the
   Monod equation, the maximum-rate constant mu(max) was found in the range
   of 3.4-6.0 mg (mg VSS d)(-1) and the half-rate concentration K-s was
   700-1150 mg l(-1). Other interim by-products included hydrogen (up to
   10(-3.8) atm), propionate (up to 25 mg l(-1)), i-butyrate (up to 780 mg
   l(-1)), and several higher-molecular-weight carboxylic acids (up to 21
   mg l(-1)). All these by-products became fully degraded eventually after
   reaching the maximum levels, except propionate which remained at the
   peak concentration. This suggests that the butyrate-degrading sludge was
   incapable of degrading propionate. Addition of formate to the feed
   solution increased the P-H2, which enhanced the formation of propionate
   but did not affect butyrate degradation. The effect of P-H2 on
   propionate was in accordance with the chemical energy analysis. The
   chemical energy analysis also suggests that the formation of caproate,
   one of the higher-molecular-weight acids, was independent of the
   increase of P-H2. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The ballasting performance of various mineral materials was investigated
   using batch settling tests. These tests revealed the complexity of the
   ballasting phenomenon; both the sludge and the mineral material affected
   the ballasting performance. Differences between the materials could be
   localized using the Tukey test, but no correlation between the
   ballasting performance and the density or the particle size distribution
   was found. It was assumed that the interaction mechanism between the
   activated sludge and the mineral material, and hence the surface
   characteristics, are crucial for the ballasting action. A set of
   settling tests was done with activated sludges and mineral materials
   with known surface characteristics. The linear regression analysis
   produced a model (r(2)=0.85) for ballasted settling where the important
   variables were sludge volatile fraction; mineral material dosage,
   density, specific surface area, cation exchange capacity; sludge
   suspended solids, mineral material particle size, and hydrophobicity. A
   batch pilot study was performed with calcium carbonate and the
   simulation program EFOR 2.2 was used to simulate the effect of the
   ballasting agent on sludge settling in connection with a higher inflow
   and higher sludge concentration than was possible to achieve in the
   pilot plant. EFOR 2.2 simulations indicate a possibility to increase the
   inflow by 67\%, and the limiting solids flux by 155\% when calculated as
   kgSS/m(2)h and 43\% when calculated as kgVSS/m(2)h. This study gives a
   clear indication of the possibility of improving the sludge settling by
   ballasting. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Thermophilic (55 degrees C) anaerobic degradation of swine manure was
   found possible even at an ammonia content of 6 g-N/l, with a low methane
   yield of only 67 ml CH4/g-VS and a high concentration of volatile fatty
   acids (11.5 g acetate/l). Several methods were tested in order to
   increase the methane yield. Addition of 1.5\% (w/w) activated carbon,
   10\% (w/w) glauconite or 1.5\% (w/w) activated carbon and 10\% (w/w)
   glauconite resulted in an increase of the methane yield to 126 ml CH4/g
   VS, 90 ml CH4/g VS and 195 ml CH4/g-VS respectively. Batch experiments
   showed that at an ammonia concentration of 4.6 g-N/l even small amounts
   of sulphide (23 mg S2-/l) inhibited biogas production. However, addition
   of activated carbon (2.5\% (w/w)) or FeCl2 (4.4 mM) could counteract the
   inhibition which was mainly explained by a reduction of the sulphide
   content by adsorption to the activated carbon or precipitation as
   ferrous sulphide. The methane yield could be increased to 102 ml
   CH4/g-VS by switching off the stirrer half an hour before and after
   substrate addition, which was attributed to increased biomass retention
   due to improved sedimentation. Increasing the hydraulic retention time
   (HRT) from 15 to 30 days resulted in an increase of the methane yield to
   182 ml CH4/g-VS. Addition of granules from a thermophilic upflow
   anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating volatile fatty acids gave only
   a temporary increase in the methane yield. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The aqueous concentrations of oils, fuels and solvents resulting from
   riverine spills are highly dependent upon the dissolution rate
   coefficients, on which there is little information available. The
   water-film mass transfer rare coefficient was measured for the
   dissolution of a hexane slick in a stirred cylinder and in an
   oscillating grid chamber. In both devices, the turbulence was generated
   beneath the oil-water interface, similar to the bed-generated turbulence
   in rivers. The liquid-film coefficient was also measured during
   reaeration studies, conducted without a surface slick under the same
   conditions. In comparing the coefficients measured with a slick and
   without, the presence of the surface slick was found to have minimal
   impact on the water-film mass transfer coefficient after indexing
   properly with the Schmidt number. Thus, the dissolution rate coefficient
   for any compound can be easily predicted from the reaeration rate
   coefficient for a given river reach. Additionally, no scale effects were
   detected between the between the 4 L stirred cylinder and the 87 L
   oscillating grid chamber (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Turbid waters, containing suspended and colloidal particles, are
   normally treated by coagulation-flocculation followed by clarification;
   the process usually consists of the rapid dispersal of a coagulant into
   the raw water followed by an intense agitation commonly defined as rapid
   mixing. Rapid mixing is influenced by chemical and physical parameters
   and the final result of the whole treatment depends on this step. The
   study focused on the most important parameters of rapid mix design:
   velocity gradient and rapid mix time. Wastewaters from a tannery
   processing stored ovine hides were treated with aluminium(III) or
   iron(III) salts. Experimental results indicate that rapid mix time has a
   strong influence on final results: an optimal combination of rapid mix
   parameters was determined. The same approach was applied to highly
   turbid synthetic water, obtained through dissolving kaolin in distilled
   water and the results compared with those obtained for the tannery
   wastewater. It was confirmed that high turbidity removal can be achieved
   both with a short mixing time (about 10 s) and a long mixing time (60-90
   s). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of humic acids on the TiO(2)-mediated photocatalytic
   degradation of tetrachloroethene (PCE) was kinetically investigated at
   different pH and initial substrate concentrations. The pro cess occurs
   through two parallel paths: a major oxidative route leading to
   mineralization and a reductive route leading to the formation of
   dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), also undergoing photodegradation. The rate
   of PCE decomposition was found to decrease in the presence of humic
   acids adsorbed on the semiconductor surface, while the concentration of
   the intermediate dichloroacetic acid increased. This is a consequence of
   the scavenging action bf humic acids toward photoproduced surface
   oxidant species, which makes conduction band electrons more easily
   available for interface reactions. Kinetic studies on the effect of
   humic acids in the TiO(2)-mediated photodegradation of dichloroacetic
   acid showed that the progressively greater accumulation of this highly
   toxic intermediate, observed with increasing humic acids content, was a
   consequence of both an increase in the rate of its production from PCE
   and a decrease in the rate of its oxidative photodegradation. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Lignosulfonated compounds are by-products of the sulfite pulping of wood
   and have a higher level of biological resistance than lignin.
   Degradation of lignosulfonated compounds by Streptomyces viridosporus
   strain T7A growing on nutritive or chemically defined culture media was
   quantified. Two lignosulfonated compounds, differing in their molecular
   mass distribution and chemical structure, were used: lignosulfonate
   (1-80 kDa) and vanisperse, a sulfonated oxylignin (1-20 kDa). The use of
   nutritive culture medium (containing Biosoyase) allowed both the growth
   of S. viridosporus and the production of lignin peroxidase (LiP) leading
   to in vitro lignocellulose solubilization, but no lignosulfonate
   degradation was observed. Twenty per cent of the lignosulfonate
   underwent a molecular transformation, producing non-biodegradable acid
   precipitable polymeric lignin (lignosulfonate-APPL). When a defined
   culture medium (containing glycerol as additional organic carbon source)
   was used, LiP production was growth-associated. Under these conditions
   with periodic addition of glycerol, 21\% of the lignosulfonate was
   degraded after 21 d of incubation. An inhibitory effect of
   lignosulfonate on biomass growth was suspected. When using vanisperse
   with the defined culture medium, a degradation yield of 35\% was
   obtained after 20 d of incubation. S. viridosporus was unable to degrade
   a large amount of either lignosulfonated compound though significant
   modifications of the molecular mass distributions were observed by gel
   permeation chromatography. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to investigate the feasibility of using a
   bipolar trickle tower electrochemical reactor consisting of graphite
   Raschig rings as the electrodes to remove cyanide from a cyanide
   containing effluent. Direct and indirect methods were both found to be
   efficient for removing the cyanide in either continuous or recirculating
   batch modes. The cyanide concentration in the solution was reduced from
   1500 to less than 60 mg l(-1) and from 1000 to less than 30 mg l(-1)
   with an energy consumption in the order of 18.4-26.8 kW h per kg cyanide
   removed during continuous operation. In the case of a cyanide
   concentration of 300 mg l(-1), full removal of cyanide was achieved with
   an energy consumption of 78.5 kW h kg(-1). However, less than 30 mg
   l(-1) could be achieved with an energy consumption of 8.75 kW h kg(-1)
   for this initial concentration. During treatment the rate of removal
   decreased as the concentration decreased with time. More energy was used
   to reduce the cyanide content from 30 mg l(-1) to zero (70 kW h kg(-1))
   than to reduce the cyanide concentration from 300 to 30 mg l(-1) (8.75
   kW h kg(-1)). Moreover, the cyanide content could be reduced from 1500
   to less than 300 mg l(-1) with quite a low energy consumption (3 kW h
   per kg of CN removed, i.e. 3.6 kW h per cubic metre of effluent
   treated). Full removal of cyanide has also been achieved for all initial
   cyanide concentrations during the recirculating batch operation. The
   energy consumptions for these experiments were 5.15 for 300 mg l(-1),
   5.14 for 1000 mg l(-1) and 6.3 for 1500 mg l(-1) in kW h per kg cyanide
   removed. The mass transfer coefficient for this reactor was also
   determined with an average value of 4.35 x 10(-4) ms(-1) being obtained.
   This is a typical value for such a cell. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Weathered oil contaminated seawater (WOCS) was used to investigate the
   behavior of soluble oil components in seawater in various pretreatment
   processes for removal of oil pollutants in seawater. The various
   pretreatment processes were a reverse osmosis desalination process in
   combination with advanced oxidation processes, ultrafiltration,
   coagulation, GAC adsorption, biological treatment and separation with a
   low pressure RO membrane. WOCS was prepared by mixing oil, nutrients and
   fresh seawater which was exposed to sunlight to simulate photooxidation
   and microbial degradation of oil in the marine environment. It was found
   that WOCS contained soluble components with relatively small molecular
   size, which are refractory to biodegradation and difficultly removed by
   advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), UF membrane or coagulation using
   FeCl3 or PAC as flocculants. However, DOC in WOCS (OCWOCS) was easily
   adsorbed to GAC. Low pressure RO membranes with higher salt rejection
   rate could remove more OCWOCS compared to those with lower salt
   rejection rate. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A new approach to the solubilization of excess activated sludge by
   self-digestion was studied to reduce the amount of sludge produced in
   the activated-sludge-treatment process. Excess sludge was effectively
   made soluble by anaerobic incubation at 60 degrees C after the addition
   of NaOH at. a final concentration of 0.01 N. Under these conditions,
   approximately 40\% of the sludge became soluble within 4 days. During
   self-digestion, solids in the sludge were thickened by flotation, and a
   clear liquor was obtained.
   This process was evaluated with a bench scale apparatus. The system
   consisted of an upflow column as the solubilizer. The resulting
   solubilization rate was approximately 20\% at the hydraulic retention
   time of 24 h. This was comparable to the value obtained in batch
   experiments under identical conditions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1871-1883}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Results From a series of batch experiments are presented, in which
   activated sludge obtained from an alternating type biological phosphorus
   removal process was exposed to nitrite or mixtures of nitrile and
   nitrate at various concentration levels. By comparing the course of
   phosphate, nitrite and nitrate (measured on-line) and the internal
   storage components PHB and PHV (measured manually for some experiments)
   with batches exposed to nitrate only, the effect of nitrite on anoxic
   phosphate uptake was investigated. How nitrite exposure affects
   subsequent aerobic phosphate uptake was also examined in one experiment.
   The experiments show that nitrite at low concentration levels (up to
   about 4 to 5 mg NO2-N/l) is not detrimental to anoxic phosphate uptake
   and can serve as electron acceptor for anoxic phosphate uptake. Exposure
   to higher concentration levels (roughly 8 mg NO2-N/l and greater)
   inhibits anoxic phosphate uptake completely, and aerobic phosphate
   uptake severely. The critical nitrite concentration above which nitrite
   inhibition of phosphate uptake occurs appears to be dependent on sludge
   conditions, lying in the range of from 5 to 8 mg NO2-N/l for the
   experiments performed in this study. The inhibiting effect of nitrite
   was found to last for at least several hours after the nitrite exposure.

Abstract = {{The paper presents a methodology for the calculation of the surface area
   of activated sludge secondary sedimentation tanks, based on a
   simplification of the solids flux theory. The proposed methodology has
   the advantage of being based on the integration of settling data from
   tens of full-scale plants presented by several authors in different
   countries. The equations derived are separated by settleability ranges
   (very good, good, fair, poor,very poor), which allow the easy decision
   by the designer or operator with respect to the equation to be adopted.
   The values of the hydraulic and solids loading rates compare well with
   those presented in frequently used design manuals, but have the
   advantage of allowing continuous solutions for any MLSS concentration
   and of taking into account the influence of the sludge return ratio,
   usually not incorporated in the usual methods. The paper develops two
   general equations of simple use for the calculation of the maximum
   allowable value of Q/A, therefore allowing simultaneous compliance with
   the clarification and thickening requirements of the clarifier. The
   work. includes formulae, charts and tables for the determination of the
   hydraulic and solids loading rates according to the proposed
   methodology. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   ultimately the reactor;dimensions controlled by the system's kinetics. A
   fixed volume stirred tank reactor was used to study the kinetics of
   adsorption in a single component system. Process parameters including
   the rate of agitation, dye concentration and phase ratio were studied
   with results being modelled using a dual resistance external mass
   transfer and solid diffusivity model. A single value of solid
   diffusivity described the adsorption decay curves in most instances and
   also indicated that chemisorption is the likely process of acid dye

Abstract = {{The speciation and fractionation of iron and manganese compounds from
   Hinze Dam water samples (Gold Coast City, Queensland, Australia) were
   studied using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS), electron
   paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPRS), gel filtration, ion-exchange
   chromatography, ultrafiltration and various acid digestion regimes.
   Samples were taken at various depths and times of year, and both
   filtrate and particulate samples of water column profiles and sediment
   samples were analysed. Relevant water quality parameters such as
   temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, true colour, turbidity, conductivity
   and alkalinity were also measured. Following heavy rainfall, dirty water
   and associated water treatment problems increased as catchment surface
   erosion and dynamic mixing of the whole water column induced by the
   introduction of a large volume of rainwater runoff lead to marked
   increases in particulate matter (mainly carbonates) in the water body.
   The res;lts obtained before and during artificial aeration were compared
   at different depths and times of year. Artificial aeration had an
   initial marked reduction in the levels of soluble iron and manganese in
   all the dam profiles, however, the concentrations of these metals showed
   a steady increase over the succeeding years. Statistical analysis of
   data has been undertaken to correlate the changes between the various
   forms of iron and manganese with the advent of artificial aeration. Such
   analyses indicate that a number of traditionally measured water quality
   parameters have no long-term value for predicting the likely levels of
   soluble and insoluble iron and manganese, even when correlations between
   the parameters are calculated on a seasonal rather than on a yearly
   basis. These water quality parameters are not measured solely for the
   purpose of prediction, nevertheless, the parameters may be important for
   real-time treatment process control and for general water resource
   management. Some important implications for water resource management
   and water treatment processes are discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Title = {{Ammonia removal in bubble column by ozonation in the presence of bromide}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1911-1917}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Decomposition of ammonia to N-2 in wastewater was accomplished by
   ozonation in the presence of bromide with high efficiency. To acquire
   the optimum condition for ammonia removal with minimum nitrate
   formation, the effects of Br/N ratio, pH, and initial ammonia
   concentration were investigated using a continuous bubble column with an
   effective volume of 321. Synthetic wastewater was fed into the reactor
   from the top. and O-3 gas was introduced From the bottom through a
   sintered glass diffuser. The effluent pH was automatically maintained at
   given values with NaOH, and effluent NH4+-N was automatically maintained
   at 5 mg l(-1) by adjusting the O-3 production rate. In the process, N-2
   was the main product of ammonia decomposition with nitrate as the main
   nitrogen by-product. The formation of nitrate was mainly affected by the
   Br/N ratio, N load, and pH. The ratio of NO3--N to influent NH4+-N was
   nearly linearly related to the Br/N ratio in a log-log plot, and was
   lower than 5\% at a Br/N higher than 0.40 under following conditions:
   influent NH4+-N, 600 mg l(-1); N load, 3.6-4.0 kg m(-3) d(-1); effluent
   pH, 6.9. Less nitrate was obtained at lower N loads. The minimum NO3--N
   was obtained around pH 6.0. The ratio of NO3--N to influent NH4+-N
   decreased with increasing influent NH4+-N and was ca. 1.5\% under the
   following conditions: influent NH4+-N, 1200 mg l(-1) effluent pH, 5.8: N
   load, 2.8 kg m(-3) d(-1) Br/N, 0.60. An O-3 absorption efficiency of
   more than 95\% was obtained, and ca. 5.4 g O-3 was needed for removing l
   g NH4+-N under proper conditions. Nitrite formed in the upper part of
   the reactor when the pH in the upper part was higher than 7.0, and was
   oxidized to nitrate in the lower part. It was necessary to reduce the
   vertical pH distribution in the reactor to prevent nitrite formation in
   the upper part. At an HRT of 2 h or lower and a Br/N > 0.40, BrO3--Br, a
   toxic byproduct of ozonation, was produced at a level of less than 0.1
   mg Br l(-1), and it increased with longer HRT or lower Br/N ratio. The
   minimum concentration of BrO--Br, an intermediate of ozonation, was
   obtained at an effluent pH near 6.0. BrO--Br could be quantitatively
   decomposed by Na2SO3 under ORP control. The results demonstrated that
   the process used in this study could be utilized for efficient ammonia
   removal for such inorganic wastewaters as condensate demineralization
   wastewater from thermal power plants, etc. (C) 1999 Published by

Abstract = {{An innovative process for removing heavy metals including Cu, Ni and Zn
   From industrial wastewater has been developed. The new technology was
   based on inducing the nucleated precipitation of heavy metals on the
   sand surface in a fluidized bed reactor. The results showed that pH had
   a great effect on heavy metal removal efficiency and the optimum pH was
   about 9.0 to 9.1. At this pH value, heavy metal removal efficiency could
   be achieved above 92 and 95\% when influent heavy metal concentrations
   were 10 and 20 mg/l, respectively. When pH was greater than 8.7, above
   92.4\% of the precipitation was composed of metal hydroxide. Hydraulic
   retention time (HRT) had almost no effect on heavy metal removal
   efficiency when HRT was greater than 7.1 min. Scanning electron
   microscope (SEM) analysis indicated that carbonate injection with a
   drip-wise manner was more conducive than that with a slug dosing manner
   for precipitation to be coated on the sand surface. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1925-1937}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The effect of dissolved oxygen (DO) on denitrification by activated
   sludge in a bench-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was investigated
   over a range of 0.09 to 5.6 mg/l DO. Mixed liquor DO as low as 0.09 mg/l
   was found to significantly inhibit denitrification, resulting ina rate
   decrease of 35\%. On the other hand, some denitrification activity was
   observed with DO levels as high as 5.6 mg/l, although at only 4\% of the
   anoxic rate. A one-parameter non-linear model was found to fit results
   of significant inhibition of denitrification at low DO and persistent
   denitrification at higher DO. A more complex two-parameter model
   predicted that denitrification would finally cease at a maximum liquid
   DO concentration when the activated sludge flee volume is completely
   aerobic. The rate of-denitrification in the SBR activated sludge flocs
   was reduced by 85\% when the mixed liquor DO was 2 mg/l (28\%
   saturation), indicating that aerobic denitrification is more persistent
   in activated sludge than has been reported in dispersed cultures of
   bacteria in water and soil, probably due to limited oxygen diffusion
   into the flocs. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The hydrolysis rates of mono-, di- and trihaioacetonitriles were studied
   in aqueous buffer solutions at different pH. The stability of
   haloacetonitriles decreases and the hydrolysis rate increases with
   increasing pH and number of halogen atoms in the molecule: The
   monochloroacetonitriles are the most stable and are also less affected
   by pH-changes, while the trihaloacetonitriles are the least stable and
   most sensitive to pH changes. The stability of haloacetonitriles also
   increases by substitution of chlorine atoms with bromine atoms. The
   hydrolysis rates in different buffer solutions follow first order
   kinetics with a minimum hydrolysis rate at intermediate pH. Thus,
   haloacetonitriles have to be preserved in weakly acid solutions between
   sampling and analysis. The corresponding haloacetamides are formed
   during hydrolysis and in basic solutions they can hydrolyze further to
   give haloacetic acids. Linear free energy relationship can be used for
   prediction of degradation of haloacetonitriles during hydrolysis in
   water solutions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The work was conducted to find a solution for establishing a
   nonconventional wastewater treatment system suitable for the conditions
   of Egyptian villages in the delta where land is scarce and expensive by
   using sand-filters. Total viable bacteria (TVB) of heterotrophic aerobic
   bacteria were studied in two sand-filter systems used for primary
   settled sewage treatment. Filter 1 consisted of two gravel layers
   separated by coarse sand (2.0-0.2 mm) mixed with gravel (10-20 mm) with
   the ratio of 2:1, while filter 2 contained coarse sand only between
   gravel layers. No significant difference was found between TVB counts in
   the top and bottom layers of sand in case of filter 1, whereas counts
   were higher at the top layer of filter 2 than the bottom layer. Among
   the common genera encountered in the filter medium were Agrobacterium
   sp., Aeromonas sp. and Pseudomonas sp.. Counts of ammonium-oxidizers and
   nitrite-oxidizers were low at the beginning of the experiment and
   started to increase and reached a stable state in the filter by day 38
   in the case of ammonium-oxidizers and day 52 for nitriteoxidizers. (C)

Abstract = {{To optimize experimental protocol for marine dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) studies in laboratory conditions, we examined the potential DOC
   releases from filters of different qualities as well as those from
   different types of bottles during 10 day-storage of Milli-Q water and
   0.2 mu m-filtered seawater. The results showed that utilization of 47-mm
   circle filters including polycarbonate (0.2 and 1 mu m-pore size),
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE: 0.5 mu m-pore size) and aluminum oxide
   (0.2 and 0.02 mu m-pore size) may induce significant DOC contamination
   ranging from 12 to 41 mu M C for the first hundred milliliters of the
   filtrated solutions. However, filtrations of 2 to 41 of Milli-Q water
   decreased the DOC blank of the fillers to 2-5 mu M C. As expected,
   precombusted (450 degrees C, 6 h) glass fiber filters rinsed with 0.5-3
   l of Milli-Q water produced very low blanks (1-4 mu M C). We found that
   0 day-storage (15 degrees C, in the dark) of Milli-Q water and 0.2 mu
   m-filtered seawater (250 mi) into 11-polyethylene, polycarbonate and
   perfluoalkoxy (PFA)-Teflon bottles, initially cleaned with HCl 1\% and
   abondantly rinsed with copious amounts of Milli-Q water as well as in
   precombusted glass bottles (450 degrees C, 6 h) induced very low DOC
   contamination of the solutions (0-5 mu M C). Although complete DOC-free
   contamination experiment is difficult to reach particularly in shipboard
   conditions, these results strongly suggest that appropriate cleaning
   procedure of the material is essential to reach blank level compatible
   with DOC studies in marine environments. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The biosorption removal of cadmium ions from aqueous solutions by using

   with calcium solution and heat improved the stability and settling
   property and increased heavy metal uptake capacities of the biomass. The
   biosorption capacities were solution pH dependent. The effects of other
   cations (Pb2+, Cu2+. Cd2+ and Zn2+) were also investigated and the
   biosorption affinity sequence for the biomass is Pb2+ > Cu2+ > Cd2+ >

Abstract = {{The overall goal of this study was to evaluate the ability of fatty acid
   methyl ester (FAME) technology to quantify Nocardia levels in activated
   sludge samples. In order to distinguish Nocardia cells in activated
   sludge, fatty acids associated with N. amarae pure culture were
   determined and compared to fatty acid profiles of non-foaming activated
   sludge. Seven fatty acid peaks were observed for N. ama,ne cells grown
   in pure culture. Two of these seven peaks appeared to be unique to
   Nocardia when compared to the FAME profiles for the activated sludge
   sample and. therefore, can potentially serve as signature fatty acids
   fbr detecting and quantifying Nocardia in similar systems. In addition,
   we performed FAME analysis on mixed liquor samples containing various
   levels of N. amarae cells. Greater amounts of the signature fatty acids
   were extracted from the mixed liquors containing higher levels of
   Nocardial and these amounts additionally correlated well with the
   conventional filamentous counting technique. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{In March, 1994, arsenic over the permissible level for drinking use
   (0.01 mg/l) was detected in wellwaters in the southern region of Fukuoka
   Prefecture, Japan. The highest concentration found was 0.293 mg/l, being
   quite high compared to other arsenic-containing wellwaters reported in
   japan. The polluted wellwaters contained NaHCO3 as the major dissolved
   inorganic component, which made the water weakly alkaline. The
   concentration of dissolved oxygen was much lower than those in
   unpolluted areas. The organic arsenic was not detected. These data
   combined with geological-geochemical inspections by boring proved that
   the arsenic pollution did not originate artificially but occurred
   naturally through an elution process long ongoing on the rocks and soils
   by the stagnant underground water. The mechanisms of arsenite/arsenate
   elution from the soil proposed were which involved (i) anion exchange
   with OH- and (ii) reductive labilization of arsenic through conversion
   of arsenate to arsenite. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The degradation of the faecal sterol coprostanol and its precursor
   cholesterol, were determined in source-separated human urine and urine
   tank sediment. The aim was to assess their potential as biomarkers of
   faecal cross-contamination in source-separated waste systems since
   traditional microbial indicators have been shown not to be reliable in
   this context. Investigations were performed at 4 and 20 degrees C in
   collected human urine and urine tank sediment to which human faeces and
   synthetic cholesterol and coprostanol were added. The individual
   degradation experiments were performed over periods of up to 118 days
   and represented a wide concentration range both for the urine and the
   urine rank sediment. Coprostanol showed no significant degradation in
   either; the urine or urine tank sediment when faeces or synthetic
   coprostanol were added. Neither the normalised variance for the
   individual slopes, nor the combined regression analysis showed any
   significant difference from the common slope of zero. For cholesterol no
   significant degradation was found in the urine tank sediment, but based
   on pooled data, a moderate decrease occurred in the urine. This was most
   evident for endogenous cholesterol in the urine at low concentrations
   where 38 and 55\% of the original amounts were lost at 4 and 20 degrees
   C, respectively. The daily rate of loss of cholesterol based on the
   regression analysis was 0.73 mu g l(-1) per day. It is concluded that
   amounts of coprostanol in urine collection tanks can be used as an
   indicator of faecal cross-contamination cumulatively occurring over the
   collection period. Together with die-off data of indicator organisms and
   pathogens, establishment of a baseline risk assessment would now be
   possible in relation to storage, handling and reuse of the urine. (C)

Abstract = {{A new agro-industrial effluent known as Sirolan CF effluent is the
   aqueous phase remaining after the chemical flocculation of wool scouring
   effluent by the Sirolan CF process. This effluent has been
   characterized, and shown to be effectively treated by biological
   degradation. It has a high concentration of organic material (5750 mg/L
   GOD), with a low BOD5/COD ratio (0.29). Aerobic biological treatment was
   tested using laboratory and pilot scale reactors, and shown to remove
   essentially all BOD5, solvent extractable material and detergent
   activity. Maximum removal of the COD was 65\% leaving a 2000 mg/L
   residual component of nonbiodegradable organic material. The combined
   processes of Sirolan C-F and biological treatment removed over 90\% of
   the COD and all solvent extractable material from raw wool scouring
   effluent. This compares favourably to existing treatment systems, and
   represents a viable and attractive alternative to treat this extremely

Abstract = {{The response to different levels of metal pollution by assemblages of
   microbenthic algae and bacteria was investigated in a lowland stream.
   Colonized glass-discs and samples of natural assemblages on coarse sand
   were used to test zinc tolerance. Tolerance was characterized by
   measuring inhibition of C-14-incorporation in microalgae and inhibition
   of H-3-thymidine incorporation in bacteria. Bacterial assemblages on
   both glass and sand from a high zinc and cadmium site were resistant to
   zinc when compared to populations from a cleaner upstream site. Algae
   from the strongly polluted site were only slightly affected by the
   highest test concentrations of zinc, in contrast to other algal
   communities. A change towards metal tolerant bacteria and algae was
   indicated and seems to occur despite the strong binding of metals by
   precipitates of iron hydroxide and organic deposits in the biofilm. The
   observations were compared with published data on short-term and long
   term zinc toxicity in algae and bacteria. The gradual changes in micro-
   and macrobenthos under high metal loads is discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This research investigates the stimulation of biological reduction of
   chlorinated organic compounds using an electric current and evaluates
   the influence of pH, current and heavy metals on the system. Copper and
   2,6-dichlorophenol (2,6-DCP) were used as the test heavy metal and
   chlorinated organic compound, respectively. Microorganisms capable of
   dechlorinating 2,6-DCP were cultured in a completely-mixed recycle
   reactor. Serum bottle batch tests using this mixed culture showed that
   increasing the levels of HZ addition from 0 to 8 mt per day enhanced
   2,6-DCP dechlorination, a pH of approximately 8.1 was optimum for
   2,6-DCP dechlorination, and added copper concentrations of 0.05 to 0.2
   mg/L showed inhibition of 2,6-DCP dechlorination. Suspended-growth batch
   tests performed in a divided electrochemical cell with the mixed culture
   in the cathode compartment showed that 2,6-DCP was rapidly dechlorinated
   at passed currents of -5 and -10 mA, an added copper concentration of 3
   mg/L was the threshold copper level that caused the inhibition of
   2,6-DCP dechlorination, and copper was removed from solution. Abiotic
   electrochemical tests showed minimal 2,6-DCP dechlorination. This study
   demonstrated that the formation of H-2 On the cathode generated highly
   reducing conditions that induced the dechlorination of 2,6-DCP, and
   simultaneous heavy metal removal and biological reductive dechlorination
   can be obtained in bioelectrochemical systems. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The objectives of the present investigations were (1) to discuss the
   dominant factors influencing mass transfer of carbon dioxide (CO2) and
   methane (CH4) in anaerobic reactors, (2) to survey theoretical
   approaches to estimate mass transfer coefficients k(L)a and (3) to
   provide experimental data in order to verify the proposed
   kla-correlation which was then used in mathematical modelling of the
   anaerobic digestion process. CO? mass transfer was found to be governed
   by the liquid phase resistance with the volumetric mass transfer
   coefficient kLa being a function of the actual biogas production rate.
   From measurements of the HCO3--concentration and the pH in the liquid
   phase, the partial pressure of CO2 in the gas phase and the
   CO2-production rate under dynamic substrate loading conditions, the
   proposed correlation between kLa and upflow gas velocity was
   experimentally verified for three different wastewaters. Measured
   kla-values for CO2-mass transfer in anaerobic reactors differed by a
   factor of 2-3 from steady-state to dynamic loading conditions. The
   experimental results matched with previously reported values and
   provided a significantly better simulation of CO2- and CH4-production in
   anaerobic reactors under dynamic substrate loading conditions. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The oxidation of high explosives (HE), TNT, RDX and HMX, contaminated
   water has been studied under different conditions. Catalytic and
   advanced oxidation employing ultraviolet and hydrogen peroxide were
   investigated. Catalytic and non-catalytic wet oxidation of HE were
   carried over a 4.45 wt\% Pt/TiO2 catalyst with a particle diameter of
   less than 105 mu m in a batch reactor at moderate pressure (less than or
   equal to 35 atm) and temperature (less than or equal to 200 degrees C).
   Ultraviolet photolysis in combination with hydrogen peroxide oxidation
   was carried out in a pyrex glass reactor with a total volume of 310 mi
   at ambient conditions. The irradiation in the photoreactor was obtained
   by a low-pressure mercury lamp that emits about 90\% of its radiation at
   254 nm with a 15 W power input. Catalytic and non-catalytic oxidation
   results indicate that the reaction rate is very much temperature
   dependent, virtually pressure independent, and mildly dependent on the
   amount of catalyst. The presence of catalyst resulted in about 20
   degrees C advantage in catalytic oxidation when compared to homogeneous
   wet oxidation. Also RDX/HMX oxidation was relatively easy without the
   presence of a catalyst at temperatures as low as 85 degrees C and
   complete oxidation occurs at above 110 degrees C in less than 30 min.
   Direct photolysis of RDX/HMX was accomplished in about 20 min whereas
   TNT was the most stable compound and the presence of hydrogen peroxide
   was essential to reach total oxidation in a reasonable time. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Modification of cellulose for heavy metal adsorption was conducted by
   the graft polymerization of glycidyl methacrylate utilizing eerie
   ammonium nitrate initiator, followed by the reaction with
   polyethyleneimine to introduce nitrogenous ligands. Infrared (IR)
   spectra of the reaction intermediates and products qualitatively
   revealed the presence of significant functional groups. Low amine to
   epoxide ratio (2 amines/epoxide) from elemental analysis of the products
   confirmed the occurrence of crosslinking between PEI and poly(GMA) side
   chain. Comparisons between metal adsorption isotherms of poly(CGMAPEI)
   adsorbent and cellulose-PEI, a previously synthesized adsorbent having
   extensive PEI crosslinking with the matrix, showed a higher metal
   affinity in the former. Based on these properties, an adsorbent
   structure model where ligands acquire an improved mobility was
   suggested. Optimization experiments Further revealed that the metal
   affinity of the this adsorbent is affected by the amount of initiator
   during polymerization. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The changing in the toxicity of mixtures of creosote-related compounds
   during their aerobic biodegradation was studied in columns of saturated
   aquifer material. The Microtox{''} assay was used to measure the
   toxicity of phenanthrene, fluorene, carbazole and p-cresol, added
   individually or in a mixture and to evaluate their detoxification during
   migration through the columns. When tested alone, phenanthrene, fluorene
   and p-cresol, inhibited Vibrio fischeri luminescence emission (15 min
   IC50=140, 750, 1500 mu g/L respectively). In contrast, the toxicity of
   carbazole was minimal. Phenanthrene, fluorene and carbazole, added
   concomitantly at concentrations varying between 30 and 300 mu g/L,
   produced between 24.4 and 49.3\% inhibition. Comparison with individual
   toxicity responses suggested antagonistic interaction between these
   compounds. The toxicity of the mixture solutions decreased upon passage
   through the columns since the inhibition caused by the effluent
   solutions averaged 6\%. Additionally, p-cresol (10,000 mu g/L) enhanced
   the efficiency of detoxification of the column system; the inhibition by
   the compound mixture decreased from 81.4\% (SD = 2.0) to 15.8\% (SD =
   1.8) after having passed through the first 3.8 cm of the column, and was
   undetectable at the two other downgradient ports. A comparison of the
   data of product disappearance and changes in toxicity indicated that
   detoxification was the result of the disappearance of phenanthrene and
   p-cresol. However, the persistence of fluorene and/or potential
   metabolites seemed to have caused some residual toxicity. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Conventional wastewater disinfection is typically accomplished via
   chlorination, ozonation or ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. For each of
   these disinfectants, changes in the composition of the disinfected
   waters are known to occur and have been linked to changes in the
   toxicity responses of the disinfected effluent. The toxicity responses
   of wastewater effluent samples exposed to an alternative disinfectant,
   gamma (gamma) radiation, have been studied and compared with the
   responses to chlorinated (with dechlorination) and undisinfected
   municipal wastewater effluent samples. Predisinfection samples were
   taken from six wastewater treatment plants. Multiple samples from each
   facility were split and subsamples were exposed to gamma-irradiation, as
   well as chlorination/dechlorination in batch reactors. The disinfected
   and undisinfected subsamples were than assayed for toxicity using the
   Cerlodaphnia dubia chronic toxicity test. Wastewater disinfectant doses
   were sufficient to meet coliform limitations for effluent quality in all
   cases; furthermore, the batch disinfectant exposure protocols
   accomplished extents of coliform inactivation that were comparable to
   those observed in the disinfection unit operations at the full-scale
   facilities from which the samples were collected. Analysis of data from
   these assays showed that gamma-irradiation induced significantly less
   toxicity in terms of C. dubia survival and reproduction than
   chlorination/dechlorination. Toxicity in the gamma-irradiated effluent
   either decreased or was unchanged as compared to an undisinfected
   sample; effluent samples subjected to chlorination/dechlorination often
   showed a statistically significant increase in toxicity as compared to
   the undisinfected samples and the gamma-irradiated samples. (C) 1999

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new control strategy for highly loaded anaerobic
   digestion processes. This strategy is based on the analysis of
   disturbances added on purpose to the influent flow rate. The control
   system then carefully overlooks the response of only two parameters, the
   biogas output flow rate and the pH, in order to determine whether or not
   the load can be increased. The main advantages of this approach rely on
   its capability to automatically adapt the input flow rate to changes in
   the influent concentration, without any information on its
   concentration, and to optimize the biological treatment in relation to
   the influent degradability. Experiments have been carried out using two
   fluidized bed reactors of different sizes and they have demonstrated
   very good capability of this control strategy. In addition, since only
   very simple sensors are needed, industrial applications of this strategy
   can be expected. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The wastewater from sewage processing plants shows characteristic
   fluorescence signatures when excited by UV light in the 240-300 nm
   wavelength band. A typical signature is a spectrum having a broad band
   centered at about 350 nm and two relatively less intense bands centered
   at about 390 and 430 nm. Samples of settled sewage, treated in an
   aerobic digester, show a substantial reduction of the intensity of the
   350 nm band and comparatively much smaller reduction of the strength of
   the other two bands. The biodegradable chromophoric constituent species
   are, therefore, considered to be the major contributors to the overall
   fluorescence within this band. The intensity of this band has been found
   to have a good correlation with the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
   parameter. This parameter is universally used for assessing the sewage
   strength and the suitability of the treated effluent for discharge into
   rivers or reservoirs. Therefore, the fluorescence technique is
   considered to have the potential for use in noninvasive continuous water
   quality monitoring thereby, enabling on-line process control in sewage
   treatment plants. However, fluorescence strength is affected by the pH
   of the sample, particularly at higher values. This has to be taken into
   account for the practical utilization of this technique. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{In this study the concept of subaqueous capping of contaminated
   sediments of lakes, rivers and coastal waters with active barrier
   systems (ABS) in order to minimise the contaminant release into the
   surface water is developed. This concept is supposed to provide a
   low-cost alternative to conventional methods in water protection. Active
   barrier systems, i.e. reactive geochemical barriers on the basis of
   low-cost materials, shall actively inhibit contaminant release from the
   sediment into the surface water, without the hydraulic contact between
   sediment and surface water being disturbed. Theoretical considerations
   and first experimental results regarding the retention of Pb2+ by four
   different zeolitic rocks suggest that natural zeolite as a reactive
   material in sediment capping meets all the economical and technical
   requirements posed by the active barrier concept. Natural zeolites are
   capable of demobilising large amounts of cationic pollutants by
   sorption, as shown for Pb2+, and, furthermore, they are capable of
   demobilising non-polar organics and anionic contaminants, when the
   zeolite surface is pretreated with cationic surfactants. Active barrier
   systems on the basis of natural zeolites thus can be applied to nearly
   any type of contaminated sediment. Additionally, the physical
   characteristics of zeolitic rocks, as grain size and density, facilitate
   their use in subaqueous applications. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Wastewater effluent dosing rates of 25 and 50 mm/day were intermittently
   applied in eight daily doses of 3.125 or 6.25 mm each, to 15-cm diameter
   80 cm high columns packed with two types of Light Weight Aggregates
   (LWA) and one type of activated carbon aggregates. After three months of
   wastewater effluent application at 25 mm/day to stabilize the filter
   systems, Escherichia coli was spiked once each day onto the surface of
   the columns and wastewater effluent was applied at 25 mm/day for the
   months. The same procedure was repeated for effluent application rate of
   50 mm/day. During operation, hydraulic behavior was monitored by
   moisture tensiometers located 5, 10, 20 and 40 cm below the filter
   surface as well as by radiotracer studies. Removal behavior was assessed
   by sampling and analysis of the column percolate and media within the
   column. The removal of E. coli was decreased as a result of increasing
   the dosing rate for all three media. In all media, the highest removal
   rates were observed in the upper part of the columns. Sorption head
   measurements showed that each effluent dose rapidly penetrates through
   the upper part of the filters, until a steady state, unsaturated flow
   was established in the lower sections. Different flow patterns were
   observed for the two dosing rates. For the dosing rate of 50 mm/day, the
   flow was penetrating faster, and to a deeper level before establishing
   steady unsaturated flow. Fast flow through the upper part of the filter,
   where the bacterial removal is most effective, may explain the
   significantly lower removal for the dosing rate of 50 mm/day. The
   dynamic behavior of the filter columns showed that most of the water
   movement took place right after dose application, during intermittent
   dosing. This indicates that dose size may be just as important for
   bacterial removal as the daily dosing rate. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A series of eight pilot-scale ponds (Au Tau pond system) were
   constructed at Au Tau Fisheries Office, Hong Kong Agriculture and
   Fisheries Department. Water from a polluted river (Kam Tin River) was
   pre-treated in the first four ponds by providing sedimentation (S1, S2)
   and aeration (A1, A2). The effluent from A2 was introduced into the
   latter four ponds (C1-C4) for polyculture of six species of freshwater
   fish (silver carp, big head, common carp, grass carp, tilapia and black
   bass) and supplementary fish feed (peanut cake) was provided. All fish
   (except grass carp) grew to marketable size within one year with a total
   yearly net yield of 5 t ha(-1) yr(-1). In addition to the supplied fish
   feed, fish also fed on the natural food developed in the ponds and fish
   growth (except common carp and tilapia) was found to be significantly (p
   < 0.05) correlated with the concentrations of organic matter and
   nutrients in water. Biological oxygen demand, inorganic N and PO43- were
   responsible for 60-80\% variations of fish growth according to multiple
   regression analysis, which suggested that organic matter and nutrients
   in ponds affected fish growth through the food web developed in ponds.
   The N conversion to fish flesh from total N input was not more than
   3.5\% which was below the range reported in other studies (5-25\%). The
   total carbon contents in the sediments of fish ponds did not change
   significantly (p > 0.05), but the significant increase of N (p < 0.05)
   seemed to be derived from the input of fish feed and algal
   precipitation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to probe experimentally the
   characteristics of the Fenton oxidation of p-chlorophenol to develop a
   mechanistic model that appropriately represented the mechanism. Batch
   experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of pH, Fe and
   hydrogen peroxide levels, p-chlorophenol concentration and chloride
   level. The decomposition proceeded rapidly only within a limited pH
   range of 2-4. It was typical of the decomposition that an initially fast
   decomposition rate was significantly reduced within a few minutes. The
   fast initial rate was first order with p-chlorophenol and its rate
   constant was proportional to the initial level of Fe2+ and hydrogen
   peroxide. The occurrence of the slow phase of the decomposition was
   primarily attributed to the Fe2+ depletion caused by Fe-organic complex
   formation. The final extent of oxidation was limited by hydrogen
   peroxide. The effect of chloride was pH dependent and could be
   significant as its concentration increased. These experimental
   observations strongly suggest that the reactions accounting for the
   conflicting effects of organic intermediates and products and
   heteroatoms should properly be included in the future models. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Concentrations of biogenic gases (O-2 and CO2) and respiration rates
   were measured at 7 sites along major tributaries of the Piracicaba River
   to address the effects of sewage loading on aquatic metabolism. Strictly
   aerobic conditions were observed at upstream sites (less polluted), with
   concentrations of O-2 at or above and CO2 slightly above atmospheric
   equilibrium. Concentrations of biogenic gases were independent of
   variations in discharge and relatively constant during the sampling
   period. Respiration rates were significantly higher at upstream sites
   and CO2 concentrations were above atmospheric equilibrium. The
   concentrations of CO2 at downstream sites were inversely correlated with
   discharge. At the downstream sites (more polluted), anthropogenic inputs
   of labile organic matter (sewage) altered the aquatic metabolism by
   creating a less aerobic environment. At these sites, O-2 concentrations
   were always below atmospheric equilibrium and directly related to
   discharge. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ozone decomposition kinetics was determined for surface water in batch

   experiments were higher than those determined from batch experiments.
   The difference was attributed to a variable instantaneous ozone demand.
   Ozone reaction in batch experiments was described with the n-th order
   kinetics. The order of reaction (with respect to ozone concentration)
   varied from 0.4 to 2 depending on the ozone dose transferred to water
   before each batch test. Specific reaction rate was proposed as a
   measurable parameter characterizing transformations of ozone-reactive
   compounds. The changes in reaction order suggested an increase of the
   reactivity of the products of ozonation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Landfill leachate samples were collected at four Danish landfills. The
   samples were collected anaerobically for characterization of the
   leachate in terms of pH, total alkalinity, total solids, total organic
   carbon, cations, anions and heavy metals. The sample procedure was
   designed to accurately reflect the in situ mobile colloid and associated
   contaminant concentrations. The leachate samples were separated into
   size fractions in order to obtain information about size distribution of
   colloids and associated heavy metals using filters with the pore sizes:
   1.2, 0.40 and 0.001 mu m. The general characterization of the four
   leachate samples showed large variation in the leachate quality for the
   investigated landfills ranging a factor of 2-60 among the four landfills
   for individual parameters. The dominant part of the colloidal material
   was in the smallest colloidal size fraction (0.001-0.40 mu m) with total
   organic carbon (TOC) as one of the major components of the colloidal
   mass. Also Si, Al, Ca, Fe and S were found in the colloidal fractions.
   This indicated that both clay type particles, organic matter and
   precipitates (most likely sulfides) were present in the leachate
   samples. The distribution of the investigated elements varied from Cl
   being primarily in the dissolved fraction to Fe which mostly was found
   in the colloidal fractions. The concentrations of heavy metals in the
   leachate samples were 0.2-3.6 mu g Cd/L, 28-84 mu g Ni/L, 85-5310 mu g
   Zn/L, 2-34 mu g Cu/L, 0-188 mu g Cr/L and 0-16 mu g Pb/i, with a
   considerable but highly varying part of the heavy metals associated with
   the colloidal fractions. However, when the heavy metal content in
   leachates is low, it is probably not of major environmental concern that
   part of the heavy metal is associated with the colloids. However, if the
   metal content is high and, as was the case for Zn in one of the leachate
   samples, nearly exclusively associated with the colloidal fractions, the
   behavior of the heavy metal in the leachate treatment facilities and in
   the environment may differ from the behavior expected for truly
   dissolved heavy metal. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A simple dynamic model is presented for fast simulation of the removal
   of multiple substrates by different bacterial species growing in a
   biofilm reactor. The model is an extension to the well-known half-order
   reaction concept that combines a zero-order kinetic dependency on
   substrate concentration with diffusion limitation. The basic idea behind
   this model implementation is to decouple the calculations of the two
   major processes in the biofilm: substrate diffusion and biochemical
   conversion. The separate assessment of substrate diffusion allows to
   relate the penetration depth of substrates to a fraction of biomass that
   is active in conversion. The conversion is then calculated considering
   only the active fraction of the biomass. The model is compared to
   experimental data from the literature and is found to be able to closely
   replicate the overall dynamics in a biofilm system. The major advantage
   of the proposed model is the simple structure which leads to a reduction
   of the computational effort as compared to state-of-the-art
   mixed-culture biofilm models. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Physical and chemical parameters (including stream flow, temperature,
   pH, dissolved ion concentrations and biological oxygen demand) indicate
   that the water of Oak Creek, AZ is of high quality. However, fecal
   coliform enumerations of Oak Creek demonstrated an annual deterioration
   of water quality during the summer seasons of 1994, 1995 and 1996. The
   summer season is characterized by high recreational use and by summer
   storm activity. During the summer periods, violations (> 800 cfu/100 mi)
   of Arizona Department of Environmental Quality guidelines for its
   `unique waters' designation were recorded during 17 out of 54 sampling
   days and seriously compromised (< 150 cfu/100 ml) water quality was
   recorded for 37 out of 54 sampling days. In addition, two sediment sites
   were identified with high fecal coliform counts, averaging 2200 times
   the fecal coliform counts of the water column. The results of this study
   show that sediment agitation by recreational activity and storm surges
   associated with the summer storm season are responsible for the impact
   to water quality and not recreational users directly, as suggested by
   previous studies. Sources of fecal pollution in the Oak Creek watershed
   may include grazing cattle, natural animal populations primarily elk and
   deer, septic tanks, failed municipal sewage systems and recreational
   users. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an evaluation of the possibilities of using
   ultrafiltration as a pre-treatment for reverse osmosis, in a double
   membrane filtration scheme, in order to recycle biologically treated
   refinery effluent as cooling water make-up. This study focused on
   establishing the influence of process conditions for ultrafiltration,
   i.e. pressure, duration of fouling, frequency and duration of
   backwashing and chemical cleaning, on the rate of fouling and process
   efficiency. Two ultrafiltration membranes provided by the same
   manufacturer, made of polyethersulphone/polyvinylpirollidone, with the
   same molecular weight cut-off (150,000 Da), but with different coatings
   have been used. A comparison between their experimental behaviour, under
   the same process conditions, was made in a laboratory scale system
   operared in dead-end mode, at constant transmembrane pressure, using as
   influent secondary refinery wastewater. The effect of
   reversible/irreversible fouling was studied by means of clean water flux
   restoration after different cleaning procedures. Experimental results
   showed that the A-LF (low fouling) membrane was easy to clean by
   backwashing or enhanced backwashing, having a better flux restoration
   and a higher efficiency as production and operation than the A membrane.
   Average removal efficiencies of 98\% for turbidity and TSS and 30\% for
   COD have been obtained, for ultrafiltration tests, irrespective of
   process conditions. The best chemical cleaning agents, considering the
   results of relative flux restoration, were found to be citric acid and
   sodium hydroxide. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Surfactant mediated solubilization and simultaneous microbial
   degradation of phenanthrene in a completely mixed batch system has been
   studied. A mathematical model is presented based on the rates of solids
   dissolution, substrate biodegradation and oxygen uptake in terms of five
   coupled differential equations. The model accounts for the concurrent
   utilization of surfactants for cell growth. The system of differential
   equations has been solved by numerical Integration to calculate the
   oxygen utilization, cell mass production and substrate concentration as
   a function of time. Sensitivity analysis of the model indicates that the
   maximum specific growth rate, the oxygen consumption coefficient, cell
   yield coefficient and dissolution coefficient are the most significant
   parameters that control the process. Four commercial nonionic
   surfactants at a concentration of 25 mg/L were tested to evaluate, their
   effect on biodegradation rates of phenanthrene. The model could
   adequately predict the oxygen uptake,cell growth and substrate
   disappearance data. observed in the experimental studies. The presence
   of surfactants enhanced the biodegradation rate for phenanthrene. The
   results also indicated that the most significant effect of surfactant
   addition was the increase in the dissolution rate of phenanthrene to the
   aqueous phase. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A review concerning the development, applicability and possible future
   application of the anaerobic baffled reactor for wastewater treatment is
   presented. The reactor design has been developed since the early 1980s
   and has several advantages over well established, systems such as the
   upflow anaerobic sludge blanket and the anaerobic filter. These include:
   better resilience to hydraulic and organic shock loadings, longer
   biomass retention times, lower sludge yields, and the ability to
   partially separate between the various phases of anaerobic catabolism.
   The latter causes a shift in bacterial populations allowing increased
   protection against toxic materials and higher resistance to changes in
   environmental parameters such as pH and temperature. The physical
   structure of the anaerobic baffled reactor enables important
   modifications to be made such as the insertion of an aerobic polishing
   stage, resulting in a reactor which is capable of treating difficult
   wastewaters which currently require several units, ultimately
   significantly reducing capital costs. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The modelling of the flocculation process is reviewed. Recent
   developments in this area are discussed with reference to the classical
   analytical expression of Smoluchowski defining collision frequency and
   originally published in 1917. The constraints imposed by six principal
   assumptions made by Smoluchowski are considered individually, with the
   key models that have been developed to address specific limitations
   discussed in detail. These assumptions comprise: (1) all particle
   collisions lead to attachment, (2) fluid motion is limited to laminar
   shear, (3) particles are monodispersed (i.e. all of them are the same
   size), (4) no breakage of flocs occurs, (5) all particles are spherical
   in shape and remain so after collision and (6) collisions take place
   only between two particles. The discussion incorporates an examination
   of particle dynamics (i.e. rectilinearity vs curvilinearity), particle
   surface chemistry (van der Waals attraction and electrostatic
   repulsion), mixing parameters (mixing intensity and the Camp number) and
   the key flee growth parameter of fractal dimension D. In doing so
   limitations of modernised theories are identified. It is concluded that
   constraints imposed on the interpretation of models based on microscopic
   aspects of the system, pertaining mainly to those phenomena presiding at
   the particle:solution interface, severely restrict their application in
   real systems. The more recent microscopic approach based on
   characterisation of the system through determination of the fractal
   dimension as a function of time offers the opportunity of a simpler yet
   more representative modelling, but none-the-less, currently relies on
   empirical measurement using fairly sophisticated experimental
   techniques. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1990 the Agricultural University of Norway and Alfa Laval Agri Ltd
   have developed a small scale thermophilic aerobic reactor for processing
   liquid organic wastes and turning them into a stable acid hygienic
   product. The reactor has proven to be a multipurpose reactor, that can
   process a wide range of organic substrates with VS-contents from about
   1.5-9\%. It is a prefabricated, compact and self contained unit with all
   parts mutually adapted to each other, and suitable for local operation.
   A control system runs the process based on given set values to predict
   the product quality. The most unique results obtained are high oxygen
   utilisation, low air flow, no ammonia loss and very low odour release.
   The reactor causes no atmospheric pollution. The degradation of organic
   matter is moderate, and the processed substrate has the highest possible
   agronomic value. The hygienic quality of the product satisfies the
   criteria set by the Norwegian authorities. The stability of the product
   proved to be sufficient for a storage period of 10 months. By
   controlling the process carefully, same results are obtained in this
   one-stage reactor as in two-stage reactors. Use of one-stage instead of
   two-stage reactor means reduced investments and simplified operation.

Abstract = {{Sediment toxicity test and bioassay protocols are currently being
   standardised in order to meet European legislative requirements for
   product assessments and environmental monitoring. Most existing test
   methods require that sediment-dwelling organisms are exposed to test
   substances bound to sediment in test systems with uncontaminated
   overlying water. These test systems have not been widely compared with
   responses of field populations under realistic exposure conditions. In
   this study, sediment toxicity data generated in the laboratory were
   compared with the response of a field population of the midge Chironomus
   riparius exposed to the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin. In the field
   this insecticide was applied to the overlying water column of artificial
   pond systems to give nominal concentrations of 1, 10, 50 and 100 mu g/L.
   The field response, as measured by larval density and adult emergence,
   was not predicted by bulk sediment chemical concentration, sediment
   toxicity test or laboratory bioassay results. All three measurements
   underestimated acute toxic effect. Rather, toxicity to C. riparius in
   the field was predicted more accurately using a short-term water-only
   toxicity test. No chronic or sublethal effects due-to sediment-bound
   permethrin were observed. This indicates that the primary route of
   exposure in the field was probably via the water column. Primary routes
   of exposure are difficult to predict a priori for different chemical
   types until the factors affecting bioavailability have been fully
   elucidated. Until this time, there isa need for the validation of
   predictive sediment toxicity tests and for the measurement of in situ
   biological response in conjunction with sediment chemistry and toxicity
   for environmental monitoring purposes, particularly when ongoing
   exposure via the water column is likely. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Routine detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts depend on
   immunofluorescence assays (IFA) employing fluorescently labeled
   monoclonal antibodies. Commercially available mAbs used for the
   detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts are of the IgM or IgG3 subclass,
   whilst those used for Giardia analysis are of IgM and IgG classes
   including IgG1. These mAbs suffer from nonspecific binding to detrital
   particles present in environmental samples resulting in high levels of
   background fluorescence. New mAbs of the IgG1 subclass to Giardia and
   Cryptosporidium selected primarily for water analysis have recently
   become available. These antibodies exhibited lower levels of nonspecific
   particulate binding compared with commercially available antibodies. The
   degree of background fluorescence observed following mAb staining of
   particles that were not oocysts or cysts varied between the water types
   analysed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Physically conditioned water, made by passage between the poles of a
   magnet or by injecting a weak electrical signal, is used for the
   prevention and removal of lime-scale, but also has diverse biological
   effects. In this investigation, we have shown both stimulations and
   inhibitions of the multiplication of yeast cells, depending on the
   degree of conditioning. Weakly conditioned water is stimulatory, but
   strongly conditioned water is inhibitory. Conditioned water also
   increases the toxicity of heavy metal ions such as copper and cobalt. We
   suggest that these effects are due to colloidal impurities, which have
   been activated by the conditioning process, interacting with structural
   calcium in the cell membranes to make them more permeable. The
   stimulations may be due to the inward leakage of small amounts of
   calcium to stimulate metabolism by acting as a ``secondary
   messenger{''}. The inhibitions may be due to more severe damage to the
   membranes allowing the entry of larger and more toxic quantities of
   calcium and, if present, other noxious materials. This is discussed in
   relation to the beneficial and adverse effects of conditioned water on
   the growth and well-being of higher organisms. Possible applications
   include stimulating the growth of organisms at optimum levels of
   conditioning, inhibiting unwanted microorganisms at higher levels and
   increasing the efficacy of biocides. Attention is also drawn to a
   similarity between the biological effects of conditioned water acid
   those of weak electromagnetic fields. We discuss the possibility that
   some of the effects of electromagnetic fields on living organisms are
   due to their interacting with colloidal cell components and membrane
   surfaces by a mechanism analogous to the conditioning of water. This is
   discussed in relation to ion cyclotron resonance phenomena and an
   explanation based on our proposals given for the hitherto unexplained
   differences in biological responses to the resonant frequencies for
   calcium and potassium ions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Invertebrate samples from nine East Anglian rivers were collected above
   and below crossings of the A12 and A14 trunk roads in spring and summer
   1996 to assess any impact due to road run-off discharges. The Biological
   Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) score, average score per taxon (ASPT)
   and Shannon diversity index values were compared between upstream and
   downstream sites. Only the BMWP score was significantly lower in summer
   at downstream sites in those rivers crossed by the A12. Zinc, lead and
   cadmium concentrations in sediments and invertebrates (Asellus
   aquaticus, Gammarus pulex, Sialis lutaria) did not differ significantly
   between upstream and downstream sites. There was a significant
   relationship between metal concentrations in sediments and invertebrates
   only for lead. Road run-off from these trunk roads appears to have no
   major impact on the receiving streams. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title = {{Turbidity changes caused by collapse of cyanobacterial gas vesicles in
   water pumped from Lake Kinneret into the Israeli National Water Carrier}},

Abstract = {{The cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon ovalisporum Forti appeared in Lake
   Kinneret for the first time in the summer and autumn of 1994 and
   reappeared in 1995-1997. In 1994 it formed a large bloom (6000 filaments
   ml(-1)) that caused high turbidity (up to 7 NTU), which is attributed
   mainly to light scattering by gas vesicles. When lake water was pumped
   into the high-pressure pipe (2.5 MPa) of the Israeli National Water
   Carrier (INWC) the turbidity of the water decreased by 65\%, the
   Aphanizomenon filaments lost their buoyancy and some filaments
   fragmented. Application of 0.6 MPa pressure to cultures of the Lake
   Kinneret strain of A. ovalisporum in a pressure nephelometer caused
   collapse of all gas vesicles; the turbidity decreased by 80\% and all of
   the filaments sedimented. The mean critical collapse pressure of the gas
   vesicles (p(c)) was 0.58 +/- 0.02 MPa (with cells suspended in
   hypertonic sucrose solution), the apparent mean critical collapse
   pressure (p(a)) was 0.27 +/- 0.02 MPa (with cells suspended in culture
   medium) and the mean turgor pressure (p(t)) was 0.33 +/- 0.02 MPa, The
   value of p(a) is lower than the pressures in any of the five
   high-pressure pipes (0.6-2.5 MPa) along the INWC. It is concluded that
   gas vesicle collapse caused the observed decrease in turbidity in the
   system. The combined physical, chemical and biological treatments given
   in the INWC system resulted in a 99.9\% decrease in the A. ovalisporum
   biomass. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) for
   wastewater treatment not only affects the activated sludge plant itself,
   but also the connected process units, particularly those involved in
   sludge treatment. The consequences hereof are still little known,
   although problems may appear if phosphorus from digester supernatant is
   recycled to the activated sludge plant. This study illuminates the
   influence of EBPR on the plant performance by combining models for
   individual process units in simulation scenarios for the whole plant.
   The mathematical models are based on information from literature and
   previous experimental studies. The results contribute to the assessment
   of the overall environmental impact of wastewater treatment and support
   the evaluation of process alternatives. Four scenarios are presented by
   quantifying steady state nutrient fluxes within the plant flowscheme and
   to the environment: (I) the operation with separate thickening of excess
   sludge, (II) the operation with combined thickening of primary and
   excess sludge via primary clarification, (III) the influence of primary
   sludge fermentation in order to produce volatile fatty acids and (IV)
   the plant performance at increased phosphorus level in the influent.
   Moreover, the findings indicate that at the current Swiss wastewater
   composition EBPR seems to be feasible, favorably supported by primary
   sludge fermentation. However, substantially increasing phosphorus
   concentrations in the influent would exceed the capacity of the process
   and make an EBPR plant questionable. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The application of the EXAMS model to estimate the likely distribution
   of the steroid oestrogens, 17 beta-oestradiol, oestrone and
   ethinyl-oestradiol in the Rivers Thames, Calder and Aire, U.K, is
   described. The model uses parameters estimated from laboratory
   measurements using material collected from each of the three rivers or
   from the literature. Total concentrations in the water column were
   predicted to be similar for 17 beta-oestradiol and oestrone and an order
   of magnitude less for ethinyl-oestradiol, reflecting the difference in
   the sewage input loads of the chemicals used in the models.
   Concentrations under average conditions were predicted to (a) be found
   mainly in the dissolved phase and (b) to vary between 0.21 and 0.37 ng
   l(-1) for 17 beta-oestradiol, 0.27 and 0.44 ng Tl for oestrone and 0.024
   and 0.038 ng l(-1) For ethinyl-oestradiol. Under low-flow conditions,.
   predicted concentrations increased by a factor of 4 to 10 times the
   average concentrations at the point of discharge. Predicted degradation
   processes in the water column were only significant under low-flow
   conditions and volatilization was negligible. A simple assessment of the
   model sensitivity to selected parameters identified those that were most
   significant in determining the distribution of the chemicals. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Trends in the concentrations of Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn in the estuary
   of the River Thames between 1980 to 1997 were examined using linear
   regression methods to determine whether stated reductions in metal
   discharges from all sources to the estuary have had an effect on water
   quality. Concentrations of all metals, except fb, showed exponential
   declines. Lower dilution capacities triggered by drought events post
   1989 and continued use of leaded gasoline, reversed initial declines
   observed in Pb concentrations. Control measures have achieved
   significant reductions in metal concentrations in the estuary and met
   most stated environmental objectives for the estuary. Cd and Pb were the
   exceptions. Achieved improvements compare favourably with data
   documenting experiences in other European estuaries. By 2000, metal
   concentrations in the estuary will approximate adopted European
   guidelines for freshwater, but will remain above estimated background
   levels. Given the importance of metals as determinants of water quality,
   improvements are argued to be likely initiators of subtle trends in
   biological recovery. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   were carried out at temperatures ranging from 200 to 300 degrees C at

   significant parameter, followed by retention time and oxygen
   overpressure, A considerable reduction in sludge volume and COD was
   generally obtained, producing an effluent liquor with a high oxygen
   demand and relatively stable residual solids. Simplified empirical
   equations were developed from the experimental data to describe the

Abstract = {{Whereas reductive dechlorination of tetrachloroethene (PCE) and
   trichloroethene to ethene (ETH) has been demonstrated, some laboratory
   and field studies indicate that partial dechlorination is often
   observed. Because partial dechlorination may produce compounds of equal
   or greater toxicity than starting compounds, it is important to identify
   factors that are responsible for complete dechlorination. A comparative
   study was completed to examine ethene production from a PCE-fed culture
   and a vinyl chloride (VC)-fed culture. Physiochemical conditions,
   nutrients and the electron donor (methanol) were identical for both
   cultures. PCE-fed cultures were able to sustain an ETH production rate
   of about 0.1 mu mol d(-1) whereas ETH production by a VC-fed culture
   declined to about 0.02 mu mol d(-1) over 115 d. PCE additions to the
   VC-fed culture improved ETH production. Results suggest that VC
   dechlorination to ETH may not be sustainable in the absence of a higher
   chlorinated ethene. This could mean that for sites capable of partial
   reductive dechlorination (via natural bioattenuation or stimulated
   bioattenuation), differential retardation of higher chlorinated ethenes
   may result in a contaminant plume with VC at the leading edge. In such
   cases, the degree of VC dechlorination under anaerobic conditions may
   decline with time. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of natural organic matter loading and calcium carbonate
   precipitate towards atrazine adsorption capacity of an aging powdered
   activated carbon slurry was investigated in an hybrid membrane process
   consisting of an immersed microfiltration membrane system in a
   completely stirred tank reactor containing powdered activated carbon.
   The reactor was fed with clarified Seine river water containing natural
   organic matter (NOM). Samples of the slurry were taken from the reactor
   and dried at low temperature to avoid the adsorbed NOM degradation.
   Thermal and CaCO3 analyses were carried out to characterize each sample.
   The adsorption capacity of each sample was measured by the classical
   method of isotherms, a modelling method was applied to predict the
   adsorption capacity in natural water. Kinetic experiments were carried
   out and the results were also modelized to determine kinetic parameters
   (k(f) and D-s), The isotherms showed a significant decrease of the
   capacity during the 62 d of aging (from 3.4 to 0.4 mg g(-1) for an
   equilibrium concentration of 0.1 mu g L-1 in distilled-deionized water).
   A linear relationship was found between the Freundlich constant K and
   the age (r(2) > 0.9). The kinetic experiments showed also the decrease
   of the D-s value m(from 1.16 x 10(-15) to 8.3 x 10(-17) m(2) s(-1))
   while k(f) remained constant and appeared as a non-limiting parameter.
   Operating charts based on these results were drawn as tools for
   operators giving operating conditions (age of PAC slurry and fresh PAC
   dosage rate) to remove a given concentration of atrazine. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{respective sensitivity of oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and sea urchin
   (Palacentrotus lividus) embryos and larvae to The salinity, and to
   various micropollutants (four heavy metals, three pesticides) and to two
   polluted sediments were compared with a simplified bioassay method. C.
   gigas embryos and larvae were more sensitive to copper; the sensitivity
   of both species to tributyltin (TBT) was practically the same; P.
   lividus was more sensitive to lead and mercury. The only pesticide found
   to be toxic was a herbicide, Dinoterbe, to which oyster larvae were more
   sensitive than sea urchin plutei. OF the two sediments tested, the first
   one had effects on P. lividus embryogenesis only; C. gigas embryos and
   larvae were more affected by the second sediment which was originated
   from a harbour and was polluted by heavy-metals. The choice of species
   for biomonitoring may be based on biological considerations, such as the
   availability of mature adults for obtaining gametes, or on the salinity
   of the studied area; the oyster bioassay seems to be more suitable for
   coastal and estuarine brackish waters, because of the broader salinity
   tolerance of estuarine bivalve larvae as compared to sea urchin larvae.

Abstract = {{Phenanthrene, a 3-ring aromatic hydrocarbon, was used as a model
   substrate to analyze the effect of sorption on the bioavailability of
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This study focused on sorption
   to mineral-associated humic acid (HA). Batch sorption analyses of
   phenanthrene to mineral-HA complexes were performed as integral part of
   the bioavailability experiments to account for the sorbed fraction under
   the various experimental conditions. A mixed culture,that was enriched
   from a coal tar contaminated soil dominated by Pseudomonas sp. served as
   an inoculum. Phenanthrene mineralization was substantially enhanced upon
   sorption to mineral-HA complexes and the degree of enhancement was
   positively correlated with the fraction of sorbed phenanthrene. This
   stimulation is thought to be related to sorption of both the
   microorganisms and phenanthrene to the colloidal surfaces. This study
   suggests that when sorbed contaminants are still bioavailable, the
   presence of surfaces may stimulate mineralization. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Jar testing is an important tool for the determination of the best
   chemical dosing regime for a wastewater treatment process. A consistent
   methodology has been developed for physico-chemico processes such as
   sedimentation and coagulation. These techniques however, may not be
   applicable for precipitation processes in a biological system. A jar
   testing methodology was developed for the chemical removal of phosphorus
   from activated sludge mixed liquor. In these studies, the optimum
   conditions for 5 precipitants in activated sludge were determined to
   compare their relative effectiveness. The precipitants studied were
   aluminium sulphate, ferrous sulphate, ferric chloride and two
   aluminium-based polyelectrolyte compounds. Optimisation of this process
   by a conventional method requires many tests and is time consuming. A 7
   factorial design experiment was used firstly to identify the most
   important variables, followed by a statistical ``hill climbing
   technique{''} to determine the optimum conditions for a specific
   chemical precipitant. Using only 20 tests per chemical (not including
   repeats), good phosphorus removal efficiencies (ranging from
   87.8-96.6\%) were produced For all of the precipitants. (C) 1999

   considered as an addition in improving the turbidity and dissolved Fe
   removal after the Fenton process. A first-order kinetic model was
   adopted to represent the Fenton oxidation of surfactant wastewater. The
   relation between the reaction rate coefficient and the ferrous sulfate

Abstract = {{Suitable monitoring of drinking water sources may prevent the occurrence
   of waterborne disease. Furthermore, determining the environmental
   factors which affect virus inactivation may help in predicting the fate
   of pathogenic microorganisms in water sources. This study was conducted
   to evaluate the suitability of F+ bacteriophages as indicators for
   microbial contamination of water sources and to determine the effects of
   water quality, temperature and virus type on virus inactivation. The
   inactivation of hepatitis A virus (HAV), poliovirus I, F+ bacteriophages
   and E. coli was compared in groundwater and wastewater effluents at
   various temperatures. Similar inactivation patterns were observed for
   HAV and poliovirus 1 under various experimental conditions.
   Male-specific bacteriophages persisted for the longest time in the
   various water types, whereas E. coli inactivation was the fastest in
   groundwater at 4 and 37 degrees C. Fi bacteriophages have been found
   more suitable than E. coli to predict the inactivation of pathogenic
   viruses in natural water sources. The effects of temperature and
   microorganism type have been found significant in all studied water
   types. The interaction between temperature and microorganism type was
   highly significant in groundwater and phosphate buffered saline and less
   significant in raw wastewater, indicating that wastewater may enhance
   virus persistence. The difference between the inactivation of F+
   bacteriophages and E, coli was significant under all experimental
   conditions, indicating their suitability to signal the persistence of
   pathogenic viruses in natural water sources. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Title = {{Reducing production of excess biomass during wastewater treatment}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1119-1132}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Excess biomass produced during the biological treatment of wastewaters
   requires costly disposal. As environmental and legislative constraints
   increase, thus limiting disposal options, there is considerable impetus
   for reducing the amount of biomass produced. This paper reviews biomass
   production during wastewater treatment and identifies methods for
   reducing the quantity of biomass produced. Efforts to reduce biomass
   production during aerobic metabolism must promote the conversion of
   organic pollutants to respiration products with a concomitant increase
   in the aeration requirements. Promoting further metabolism of
   assimilated organic carbon will release additional respiration products
   and reduce the overall biomass production e.g. by inducing cell lysis to
   form autochtonous substrate on which cryptic growth occurs or by
   encouraging microbial predation by bacteriovores. Uncoupling metabolism
   such that catabolism of substrate can continue unhindered while
   anabolism of biomass is restricted would achieve a reduction in the
   biomass yield. Metabolite overproduction in substrate excess conditions
   has been demonstrated in several bacterial species and can result in an
   increase in the substrate uptake while resulting in a decreased yield
   and increased carbon dioxide evolution rate. Addition of protonphores to
   uncouple the energy generating mechanisms of oxidative phosphorylation
   will stimulate the specific substrate uptake rate while reducing the
   rate of biomass production. Increasing the biomass concentration such
   that the overall maintenance energy requirements of the biomass within
   the process are increased can significantly reduce the production of
   biomass. Suitable engineering of the physical conditions and Strategic
   process operation may result in environments in which biomass production
   may be reduced. It is noted that as biomass settling characteristics are
   a composite product of the microbial population, any changes which
   result in a shift in the microbial population may affect the settling
   properties. Reduced biomass production may result in an increased
   nitrogen concentration in the effluent. Anaerobic operation alleviates
   the need for costly aeration and, in addition, the low efficiency of
   anaerobic metabolism results in a low yield of biomass, its suitability
   for wastewater treatment is discussed. A quantitative comparison of
   these strategies is presented. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The hydraulic performances of three facultative ponds, two of the Cieza
   and one of the Lorqui-Ceuti joint municipal wastewater stabilization
   ponds systems, were studied. The ponds of Cieza have a maximum capacity
   of 16,500 m(3) (F.1) and 32,000 m(3) (F.2), and both have a maximum
   depth of 1.6 m. The pond of Lorqui-Ceuti have a maximum capacity of
   27,000 m(3) and a maximum depth of 1.8 m. A dye tracer, sulforhodamine
   B, was injected with the feed flow of each one facultative ponds. In the
   course of time, samples from within and at the outlet of every system
   were taken. The data obtained prove that the hydrodynamic behavior of
   the ponds is similar to a perfectly mixed tank reactor. The average real
   residence times were also determined. When these were compared to ponds,
   considered ideal perfectly mixed tank reactors, a high level of
   coincidence was noted. It was also observed that the hydrodynamics of
   the ponds presented virtually no flow anomalies. (C) 1999 Elsevier

   that accumulated N and P can readily be released from these sludges
   during sludge thickening, dewatering and digestion. Therefore, primary
   and waste activated sludges should be treated in as aerobic a state as
   possible in separate process streams. All sludge dewatering liquors
   should be pretreated for P; suspended solids and N removal before
   recycle to the liquid phase. Composting provides a viable alternative to
   anaerobic digestion for the stabilization of BNR sludges, as use of the
   latter leads to the maximum solubilization of N and P. (C) 1999 Elsevier

   waveguide is used to monitor water quality. The primary measured
   parameter is the phase velocity of a selected guided mode. Upon exposure

   from the refractive index of the bulk sample, dissolved and suspended

   which can penetrate into the waveguiding layer. The waveguide surface
   can be readily modified in order to confer a particular sensitivity

Abstract = {{Pentachlorophenol (PCP) and the organic compounds in creosote often
   contaminate groundwater at wood preserving facilities. Since many of
   these compounds are toxic. effective water treatment technologies must
   be identified. In laboratory scale experiments saturated aqueous
   solutions of creosote and PCP were treated by the photo-assisted Fenton
   reaction, Fe3+/H2O2/UV ({[}Fe3+] = 1 mM, {[}H2O2] = 10 mM, 1.4 x 10(-3)
   M hv min(-1) black lamp ultraviolet light (UV), pH = 2.75 and 25 degrees
   C). The disappearance of 37 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), O,
   N and S-heterocyclic aromatic compounds and phenolic compounds and their
   mineralization products were monitored during a 180 min reaction period.
   Substantial (> 90\%) transformation of all compounds except a few 4- and
   5-ring PAHs was achieved in 5 min, with more extensive transformation
   occurring thereafter. The reactivity followed the order: 2 ring PAHs >
   heterocyclics > phenolics > 3 ring PAHs > 4-5 ring PAHs. Complete
   dechlorination of PCP required only 10-20 min. Within 180 min the total
   organic carbon concentration declined by about 80\% and added
   9-C-14-phenanthrene or 4,5,9,10-C-14-pyrene were mineralized by 93\% and
   35\%, respectively. About 33\% of the organic nitrogen was converted to
   a 2:1 mole ratio of NH4+ and HNO3 and trace amounts of HNO2. An
   undetermined yield of sulfate was also generated. The acute toxicity of
   the treated solution to fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) was nearly
   eliminated and the acute toxicity to daphnia (Daphnia pulex) was
   reduced. These results demonstrate the efficacy of Fe3+/H2O2/UV for
   removing creosote and PCP in water. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We studied the effect of the presence of humic substances on the

   The concentration of three microcystin variants (LR, YR and RR)
   decreased significantly in the presence of humic substances but remained
   constant in pure water when exposed to natural sunlight. After 8 h of
   irradiation in quartz tubes, the residual concentrations of the three
   variants LR, YR and RR were 55 +/- 4, 53 +/- 3 and 44 +/- 5\%,
   respectively, of the initial concentrations. Different concentrations of
   humic substances (2-16 mg l(-1) DOC) did not yield different degradation
   efficiencies. For microcystin-RR, a degradation rate was determined and
   a half-life time of 10.5 h was estimated. These results show a potential
   importance for indirect photolytical degradation for the elimination of
   microcystin's in natural waters. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The performance of an anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic (2 + 2 + 12 h of
   hydraulic retention time) process with and without inoculation of sodium
   chloride acclimated seeds was investigated using a synthetic wastewater
   with GOD, nitrogen, and phosphorus of 500, 25, and 15 mg/l,
   respectively. The sodium chloride in the fed wastewaters varied from 0
   (control) to 30 g/l while maintaining the solids retention time at 10 d.
   The results indicated that the organic (in terms of COD) and nitrogen
   removal efficiency of the non-acclimated system was reduced from 97 to
   60\% and 88 to 68\% a the salt content increased from 0 to 30 g/l NaCl,
   respectively; whereas it decreased from 90 to 71\% and from 85 to 70\%
   as the salt content rose from 5 to 30 g/l NaCl, respectively, in the
   salt acclimated system. The phosphorus removal in this study was not as
   high as those reported elsewhere; probably due to the intense
   sensitivity of poly-P bacteria to high salt concentration. Time required
   to reach steady state was higher (10-20 d) for the non-acclimated system
   than that with acclimation (8-15 d). In addition, it is apparent that
   the system started up with high salt content and acclimated seed could
   better tolerate a shock of 70 g/l NaCl as well as required less
   recuperation period than that initially fed with low salinity and
   without acclimation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   behavior as reactions on the solid-gas interface of a heterogeneous
   catalyst. The process can be described by the Langmuir adsorption
   isotherm. These photocatalytic degradations can be expressed as a
   first-order reaction. Maximum rates of photocatalytic reactions and
   efficiencies can be estimated according to the calculation of surface
   coverage of certain compounds on TiO2. Because ethanol have the double
   coverage of methanol at same concentration, it is presumed that methanol
   and ethanol have the same adsorption state of the end-group on catalyst
   surfaces. In a closed reactor, if oxygen pressure was controlled at 76
   cm H2O its reduction rate was nearly of zero order. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The bacterial community structure of phosphate removing activated sludge
   systems were compared. Samples were obtained from 21 different activated
   sludge systems, differing in design and phosphorus removal. Community
   structures were determined in a more direct manner by isolation of the
   total protein content of samples which alleviated the need to culture
   the bacteria. Proteins of the activated sludge samples were separated
   with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The objectives
   of this study were: to compare the protein fingerprints of activated
   sludge systems which differ in design and P-removal. The results
   indicated little variation between the different zones. The specific
   sludge systems tended to cluster together indicating a specific
   community structure for each system. However, this did not influence the
   P-removing capacity of the different systems studied, indicating that
   the microbial community structure was not specific in terms of its
   P-removing ability. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of sololysis at 520 kHz and oxidation with H2O2 using
   heterogeneous catalysis was investigated in aqueous solution. To select
   a convenient heterogeneous catalyst, degradation of 100 mM H2O2 in the
   presence of 1 mg ml(-1) Al2O3, ZnO, Ni2O3 and CuO was determined. The
   high est apparent first-order degradation rate was measured for CuO. The
   most intensive luminescence was observed as well with CuO, and therefore
   this metal oxide was used as heterogeneous catalyst. No effect of
   sonication was measured on the CuO-catalysed degradation of 100 mM H2O2
   although sonication affects strongly the specific surface of the
   CuO-particles. The combination of sonolysis and oxidation with H2O2/CuO
   was tested on the degradation of the hydrophilic compound phenol and the
   hydrophobic volatile compound trichloroethylene (TCE). The degradation
   of phenol was slower than if additivity of both degradation mechanisms
   is assumed. Addition of CuO/H2O2 on the other hand did not enhance the
   degradation rate of TCE at all. TCE does not react with the radicals,
   probably superoxide radicals, formed by the CuO-catalysed H2O2
   decomposition and the formation of cavitations is apparently not
   increased by adding CuO-particles. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   over a 12 month period from and around a large cosmopolitan sewage

   using primary polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000) precipitation and
   recently developed secondary concentration and purification techniques
   as preliminary steps to analysis by plaque assay or RT-PCR for
   enteroviruses, rotaviruses and hepatitis A virus (HAV). Enteroviruses
   were isolated by plaque assay from each of the different sample types at
   various points during the year. All three groups of viruses were
   detected by the PCR in different sample types and at various time
   points. The results demonstrated that RT-PCR was most useful when
   examining samples for viruses routinely difficult to identify, namely
   rotaviruses and HAV. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A simple and rapid headspace method for gas chromatographic
   determination of trihalomethanes and some chlorinated solvents in

   substances are between 0.8-8\% for concentrations of 1 and 50 mu g/l,
   respectively. The limits of quantification (LOQ) are less than or equal
   to 0.1 mu g/l for three of the THM analytes and 0.2 mu g/l for

Abstract = {{The impact of pore size on the competition mechanism between natural
   organic matter (NOM) in Illinois groundwater and the micropollutant
   atrazine was assessed using activated carbon fibers (ACFs). Two
   microporous ACFs with narrow and broad pore size distributions,
   designated ACF-10 and ACF-25, respectively, were used. The average pore
   sizes of ACF-10 and ACF-25 were 6 and 13.4 Angstrom. Single solute
   adsorption, simultaneous adsorption and preloading experiments were
   performed. On ACF-10 it was found that the adsorption of atrazine was
   reduced significantly in the presence of NOM, even though the NOM
   loading was very small as a result of pore exclusion. The uptake of
   atrazine by ACF-10 in the presence of NOM (simultaneous adsorption) was
   comparable to the NOM-preloaded capacity. In addition, preloaded
   atrazine was not displaced by subsequently adsorbed NOM. The results
   support a pore blockage mechanism by which NOM molecules block access
   to, but do not penetrate into the primary micropores. Atrazine capacity
   on ACF-25 which has primary micropores as well as a large volume of
   secondary micropores, was reduced in the presence of NOM; however, the
   reduction in capacity was much less than that observed with ACF-10.
   Preloading with NOM showed further capacity reduction compared with
   simultaneous adsorption. These results combined with the result that
   preloaded atrazine exposed to NOM showed displacement of atrazine
   support a direct site competition mechanism in the secondary micropore
   region. Attempts to regenerate NOM preloaded ACF-10 and ACF-25 using a
   strong alkali solution failed to recover atrazine capacity, suggesting
   that NOM was strongly adsorbed at the fiber surface as well as within
   micropores. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sunlight exposure is considered to be the most important cause of
   ``natural{''} disinfection in waste stabilisation ponds (WSPs). We
   examined the influence of dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and particulate and
   dissolved constituents in WSP effluent, on sunlight inactivation of
   faecal micro-organisms, using small reactors operated under controlled
   physico-chemical conditions. Inactivation of both enterococci and F-DNA
   phages increased strongly as DO was increased, and also depended on
   light-absorbing pondwater constituents, but pH was not influential over
   the range investigated (7.5 to 10). Inactivation of E. coli increased
   strongly when pH increased above 8.5, as well as being strongly
   dependent on DO. Inactivation of F-DNA phage was independent of the
   factors investigated. These results are consistent with the F-DNA phages
   being inactivated as a result of direct DNA damage by UVB in sunlight,
   whereas the other three microbiological indicators are inactivated as a
   result of photo-oxidative damage, although the target of damage is
   apparently different. Our findings of diverse influences of
   physico-chemical conditions suggest difficulties in interpreting data
   for a single micro-organism to indicate WSP effluent quality. However,
   sunlight remains the factor of over-riding importance, and disinfection
   in WSPs may be enhanced by increasing sunlight exposure. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Nitrous oxide production was measured monthly using intact sediment
   cores at five sites along the Swale-Ouse river system, Nolth-East
   England, together with one site on a highly eutrophic tributary (Wiske)
   fi om August 1995 to December 1996. Both spatial and seasonal trends
   were evident. There was a marked change in rate on passing down the
   river, with a maximum value at the most upstream site of 14 mu mol
   N(2)O-N m(-2) h(-1) (i.e. 14 mu mol N as N(2)O), 96 mu mol N(2)O-N m(-2)
   h(-1) at a mid-river site and 100 mu mol N(2)O-N m(-2) h(-1) at the most
   downstream site (145.0 km down the main river and at the freshwater
   tidal limit). The highest rate on most sampling dates was for the Wiske
   (maximum of 497 mu mol N(2)O-N m(-2) h(-1)). (All values refer to unit
   area of sediment and not the whole river bed, since extensive parts of
   the bed consist of rocky substrata at the upstream sites.) The
   downstream increase is probably explained largely by an increase in
   ambient nitrate concentration. Higher rates were evident in spring and
   summer at most downstream sites, including the Wiske; such seasonal
   changes are probably largely due to changes in temperature. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The destruction of pesticide active ingredients (AI) and commercial
   formulations in acidic aqueous solution with the catalytic photo-Fenton,
   Fe(III)/H2O2/UV, advanced oxidation process has been studied. The AI are
   alachlor, aldicarb, atrazine, azinphos-methyl, captan, carbofuran,
   dicamba, disulfoton, glyphosate, malathion, methoxylchlor, metolachlor,
   picloram and simazine. Complete loss of pure AI occurred in most cases
   in < 30 min under the following conditions: 5.0 x 10(-5) M Fe(III), 1.0
   x 10(-2) M H2O2, T = 25.0 degrees C, pH 2.8 and 1.2 x 10(19) quanta
   l(-1) s(-1) with fluorescent blacklight UV irradiation (300-400 nm).
   Considerable mineralization over 120 min occurred in most cases as
   evidenced by the appearance of inorganic ions and the decline in total
   organic carbon (TOC) of the solution. Intermediate products such as
   formate, acetate and oxalate appeared in early stages of degradation in
   some cases. Observed rate constants calculated from initial rates varied
   by a factor of <similar to 3. The commercial products, Furadan (AI,
   carbofuran), Lasso 4EC (AI, alachlor) and Lasso Microtech (AI, alachlor)
   were also tested. The ``inert ingredients{''} (adjuvants) present in
   these products had no effect (Furadan), a slight effect (Lasso 4EC), or
   a strong effect (Lasso Microtech) on the rate of degradation of the AI.
   Lasso Microtech, in which the AI is micro-encapsulated in a polymeric
   shell wall microsphere, required slightly elevated temperatures to
   effect removal of alachlor in a timely manner. The results show that
   many pesticides and their commercial formulations in dilute aqueous
   solution are amenable to photo-Fenton treatment. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The chemical oxygen demand test, which is widely used as an indicator to
   identify the characteristics of wastewater, could be disturbed by the
   inorganic substances such as nitrite, chloride, hydrogen peroxide, etc.
   For hydrogen peroxide differently to the other inorganic substances, the
   method of overcoming its interference is not mentioned in Standard
   Methods {[}APHA (1995) Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
   Wastewater, 19th edition. Washington, D.C.] and is also reported
   insufficiently in the literature until now. This work has been carried
   out to Correct quantitatively the effect of the concentration of
   hydrogen peroxide on the chemical oxygen demand. The ratio of the
   chemical oxygen demand to the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is
   affected by its concentration and is increased up to 0.4706, which is
   the theoretical value, with decreasing its concentration. The
   correlation equation, which can be applied to the hydrogen peroxide
   concentration range of 0-2000 mg/l, is proposed to correct the effect of
   the concentration of hydrogen peroxide on the chemical oxygen demand. It
   is also shown that this correlation equation can be applied to the
   samples containing hydrogen peroxide and organic substances. (C) 1999

Title = {{Ultrafiltration processes for removing humic substances: Effect of
   molecular weight fractions and PAC treatment}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{The role of humic substances in general and different molecular weight
   fractions of humic substances in particular on the membrane performance
   in terms of quality (chlorination byproducts) and quantity (permeate
   flux) is unclear. One of the goals of the present study is to evaluate
   the effect of fractionated humic substances on the ultrafiltration (UF)
   performance. A commercial humic solution was subject to gel filtration
   chromatography, and the resultant four fractions representing the
   apparent molecular weight (AMW), from 180 to 22,600 Daltons (Da) were
   filtered through a single module UF system, with a molecular weight
   cutoff 100 kDa. The fraction with the largest AMW (6.5-22.6 kDa)
   exhibits the worst flux decline with the best permeate quality, whereas
   the smallest AMW fraction (160-650 Da) exerts little effect on flux
   decline. Although the UF system is able to remove a significant portion
   of THMFP (trihalomethanes formation potential) in larger AMW fractions,
   the permeate THM in terms of mu g THMs/mg carbon is still high. Thus, UF
   systems are not effective in removing disinfection-byproducts. The use
   of powdered activated carbon (PAC) for pretreatment of humic substances,
   or in combination with different UF operating systems, to reduce
   membrane fouling actually yields adverse effects. The PAC was
   ineffective in removing those AMW fractions less than 300 or greater
   than 17,000 Da; the higher the PAC dosage, the more removal in the
   middle range of thee AMW factions. The flux decline for PAC-treated
   streams is worse than the original humic substances. Similarly, the
   combined UF-PAC system significantly decreases the flux. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Real time control aims at optimization of the urban wastewater system
   performance under dynamic loading from rain. This paper presents a novel
   approach to control the whole system: sewer system, treatment plant and
   receiving water with the aim to achieve minimum effects of pollution.
   The application of nonlinear model predictive control by means of a
   genetic algorithm reveals excellent results with hypothetical problem
   sets. The methodology makes it possible to optimize the system
   performance directly with respect to water quality parameters and to
   avoid the traditional indirect and artificial performance criteria, such
   as permissible annual overflow volume. The relevance of this novel
   approach is illustrated by the fact that no stringent correlation has
   been found in the investigation between the reduction of overflow volume
   and the increase of oxygen concentration in the receiving water. (C)

Abstract = {{Column filtration experiments with 2 mm-Phi glass beads were conducted
   to investigate the behavior of colloids during filtration. Algae and
   kaolin were used as model particles, while the chemical system was
   altered by changing the electrolyte concentration and pH. The collision
   efficiencies from the interaction between colloids and the filter medium
   were calculated with a semi-empirical approach of the single sphere
   model and clean-bed filtration theory. The experimental results indicate
   that ionic strength enhance the removal efficiencies for both algae and
   kaolin particles significantly. The removal efficiency of the filter for
   algae decreased with the increase in pH for up to pH 6. No significant
   change was observed beyond pH 6. Removal efficiencies for kaolin
   decreased with an increase in pH. It is concluded that collision
   efficiencies are sensitive to ion strength and pH. (C) 1999 Elsevier

   Influent DNT (110 mg/l) was transformed stoichiometrically to
   2,4-diaminotoluene (DAT) in this anaerobic stage. The DAT was
   subsequently mineralized in the activated sludge reactor, with complete
   recovery of DAT nitrogen. Under denitrifying conditions in the fluidized

   (2A4NT) and 4-amino-2-nitrotoluene (4A2NT), 52\% was transformed to
   unknown products and the 45\% remained as DNT. Although 3\% of the DNT

Abstract = {{In a pilot-scale, subsurface-flow constructed wetland, treatment
   experiments were carried out on lignite pyrolysis wastewater which had
   been stored for a long time in an effluent pond in order to evaluate the
   removal efficiencies of NH4+-nitrogen and organic components of a large
   molecular size. The specific wetland conditions (horizontal flow, long
   hydraulic retention time) encourage both nitrification and
   denitrification in the same ``reactor system{''} simultaneously.
   Nitrogen was removed fdr the entire duration of the experiment. No
   significant amounts of nitrite were formed. The average efficiency of
   nitrogen removal corresponded to that of wetland systems used for
   domestic wastewater treatment cited in the literature. The pilot plant
   acts like a filter with a limited filtration capacity for low molecular
   (< 1 kDa) and especially large (> 0.3 mu m) organic components.
   Consequently, the decolorisation of the water and the removal of the
   total organics decreased over time. Nevertheless, the decolorisation and
   the removal of the DOC proportions of organics within the size range of
   1 kDa to 0.3 mu m increased. Calculations show that it ought to be
   feasible to use a constructed wetland system as part of a complex
   remediation programme to improve overall water quality and in particular
   to remove large amounts of NH4+ nitrogen. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Feasibility of bioremediation for detoxification of rocket fuel-polluted
   groundwater was studied in laboratory conditions. A relatively high
   number (4 x 10(6) CFU/ml) of indigenous rocket fuel-degrading bacteria
   in the polluted groundwater from the abandoned Keila-Joa missile base
   was found, but bacterial growth in batch experiments using groundwater
   was strongly inhibited by the high concentration of pollutants. This
   inhibition was alleviated after at least two-fold dilution by pure
   water. The efficiency of solar photooxidation as a pre-treatment option
   for bioremediation was studied. Partial photooxidation of the polluted
   groundwater (yielding a decrease of the concentration of-primary
   aromatic amines by 20\%) increased the biodegradability, but also the
   toxicity of the groundwater nearly three times. In the course of two
   weeks of aerobic incubation the primary aromatic amines could be
   degraded to the residual concentration of 6-10 mg/l. The removal of
   primary aromatic amines was not accompanied by simultaneous reduction of
   toxicity, which started to decrease only after amine concentration
   decreased to its lowest level of 6-10 mg/l. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The radiolytic degradation of aerated aqueous 5 x 10(-5) M (6-10 ppm)
   2-, 3- and 4-chlorophenol, 2,4-di- and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol has been
   investigated by determination of the dose needed for complete substrate
   degradation as well as by analysing the dehalogenation process, the
   toxicity and the disserved organic carbon (DOC) in dependence of dose. A
   radiation dose of 500 Gy leads to a 100\% decomposition (corresponding
   to substrate concentrations less than or equal to 1 x 10(-6) M) for all
   compounds except 2-chlorophenol, for which 600 Gy are required. No
   influence of dose rate on the degradation rate could be observed in the
   range from 21 to 183 Gy min(-1). Dechlorination is completed at 1 kGy,
   its rate increases markedly with increasing number of chlorine atoms. At
   a dose of 1 kGy the decrease of DOC is approximately 20\%. A bacterial
   bioluminescence test was used for evaluating the toxicity of the final
   radiolytic products. Total detoxification Could be achieved by carrying
   out the irradiation procedure under air saturation and by doses of 500
   Gy, which equals that for complete degradation. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The present study assessed the stability of uncomplexed DTPA and
   Fe(III)-DTPA over 24 h, under experimental conditions similar to those
   previously used to assess the aquatic toxicity of DTPA and Fe(III)-DTPA
   (MS synthetic medium, 20 degrees C; wet laboratory water (WLW), 25
   degrees C). DTPA was measured using ion-interaction reversed-phase
   liquid chromatography at 0 h (t(0)) and 24 h (t(24)). DTPA consistently
   eluted at approximately 3.3 min. Actual DTPA concentrations corresponded
   well with nominal concentrations, justifying the use of nominal
   concentrations for previous ecotoxicological bioassays. There was no
   significant degradation of DTPA either when uncomplexed or
   ferric-complexed, over 24 h (P > 0.05). In addition, there was no
   difference in DTPA and Fe(III)-DTPA degradation between MS synthetic
   medium and WLW (P >0.05). Therefore, the previously reported decrease in
   DTPA toxicity, when complexed with iron was concluded not to be due to
   enhanced DTPA degradation. However, the presence of what appeared to be
   a degradation product in all Fe(III)-DTPA samples after 24 h, indicated
   that DTPA might be more susceptible to degradation when complexed with
   iron, as reported by other researchers. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{A freeze wastewater treatment system with a bubble-flow circulator is
   advantageous from an industrial point of view because a bubble-how
   circulation requires much less energy for the mixing of the wastewater
   to facilitate heat, mass and momentum transfers in the system than that
   using agitators or pumping circulation. In this work an ice tube was
   produced in a bubble-flow circulator and the effect of seed ice crystals
   on tube ice formation with a high purity was investigated. Without seed
   ice crystals a large supercooling appears before ice crystal formation;
   and dendritic ice;crystals are suddenly formed. Components in wastewater
   are contaminated and trapped between dendritic ice crystals, resulting
   in poor quality in the wastewater treatment. To avoid abrupt ice
   crystallization it is necessary to keep supercooling small. A seed ice
   crystal is effective for this purpose because a seed ice crystal
   generates other ice crystals, resulting in no supercooling. Model
   wastewater including polypeptone with concentrations of 5000 and 10000
   ppm, corresponding to 1290 to 3800 ppm in COD (chemical oxygen demand)
   was used. Two kinds of experiments with different types of seed ice
   addition were examined. In each concentration examined more than 30\%
   COD normalized by initial COD was confirmed in the melted ice tube with
   no seed ice. On the other hand, only a few \% of COD of the initial
   values were detected when seed ice crystals were used to initiate the
   ice tube formation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Water hardness plays an important role in waste water treatment
   processes. Calcium and/or magnesium salts of organic products are mostly
   precipitated due to their low solubility and they are less biodegradable
   than the equivalent sodium or potassium salts; more soluble in water. In
   the case of alkaline salts of fatty acids (soaps) reported in the
   present work, we have obtained a biodegradation of 80\% average in
   anaerobic digesters, which is still significantly different from the
   expected value of 100\% assumed theoretically for sodium or potassium
   derivatives. Soap biodegradation in anaerobic digester was studied both
   in laboratory scale equipment as well as on commercial scale digester of
   sewage treatment plants (STP). In the second case the biodegradation was
   further monitored on sludge amended soils using the sludge from STP's
   monitored in first step of the study. It was found that as a consequence
   of aerobic conditions prevalent in soil layer studied the remaining soap
   further biodegrades up to nearly 100\% after 150 days. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The main objective of the present study was to investigate
   polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in Mai Po Marshes Natural
   Reserve, Hong Kong. During June-December 1997, samples of sediments and
   aquatic organisms including fish (Oreochromis mossambica x O. nilotica;
   Mugil cephalus) and shrimps (Metapenaeus ensis, Macrobrachium
   nipponense), were collected from get il ais and total PCB levels were
   measured. The concentrations of PCBs in sediments reduced gradually from
   coastal sites (8.13 ng g(-1) dry wt) to landward sites (1.47 ng g(-1)
   dry wt), which suggested that PCBs in Deep Bay waters were the main
   input source entering the reserve. The calculated PCB concentrations in
   water were generally safe for aquaculture according to the U.S. EPA
   guidelines, but PCBs in muscle tissues of grey mullet (Mugil cephalus)
   exceeded the guidelines. PCB concentrations (ng g(-1) lipid) in tilapia
   increased with increases in fish body size, which was possibly due to
   active uptake of PCBs by tilapia. Within the same shrimp species,
   different sized organisms showed similar PCB contents in lipid,
   indicating that lipid content rather than body size determined body
   concentrations. The PCB concentrations in the aquatic organisms in the
   reserve posed no hazards to birds according to predicted egg toxicity
   effects. The estimated BSAFs (biota-sediment accumulation factors)
   obtained in the present study ranged From 1.10 to 2.37, which were
   similar to the reported value of 2.10 derived from various aquatic biota
   species. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The zinc biosorption capacity of a Streptomyces rimosus biomass was
   studied in the batch mode. After a heat pretreatment, optimum conditions
   of biosorption were found to be: an average saturation contact time of 4
   h, a biomass particle size between 140 and 250 mu m, the ambient
   temperature, a stirring speed of 250 rpm, and pH of 7.5. The equilibrium
   data could be fitted by a Langmuir isotherm equation. Under these
   optimal conditions, up to 30 mg(Zn)/g(biomass), was fixed. Moreover,
   additional chemical treatment of the biomass by NaOH (1 mol/L),
   increased the biosorption Capacity of about 80 mg(Zn)/g(biomass). (C)

Abstract = {{Concern over disinfection by-products (DBPs) in drinking water has been
   focused on health risks with little attention to off-flavour
   consequences of disinfection. The discovery that odorous aldehydes could
   be produced from the chlorination of common amino acids is a more recent
   concern. This research documents the yield of four odorous aldehydes
   produced from four common amino acids (isobutyraldehyde from valine,
   isovaleraldehyde from leucine, 2-methylbutyraldehyde from isoleucine,
   phenylacetaldehyde from phenylalanine) from reactions with four common
   disinfectants, free chlorine, monochloramine, chlorine dioxide and
   ozone. Only free chlorine and monochloramine produced substantial yields
   of the odorous aldehydes under conditions relevant to drinking water
   treatment. Factors affecting the aldehyde yield, including pH,
   temperature, reaction time and molar ratio (disinfectant/amino acid
   precursor) were studied. The highest aldehyde yields were obtained with
   free chlorine, at optimum conditions of pH 9, molar ratio 1.5, reaction
   time 2 h and temperature 20 degrees C. Slightly lower yields were
   observed at pH 7. These conditions produced maximum aldehyde yields \%
   of theoretical) for each amino acid precursor as follows:
   isobutyraldehyde = 66\%, 2-methylbutyraldehyde = 74\%, isobutyraldehyde
   = 85\% and phenylacetaldehyde = 87\%. Most observed aldehyde
   concentrations at maximum yields were in a range of maximum values
   (similar to 50 mu g/l) reported in treated drinking water and well in
   excess of odour detection thresholds in water. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Sulfate reducing passive bioreactors are increasingly being used to
   remove metals and raise the pH of acidic waste streams from abandoned
   mines. These systems commonly use a variety of organic substrates (i.e.
   manure, wood chips) for sulfate reduction. The effectiveness of these
   systems decreases as easily accessible reducing equivalents are consumed
   in the substrate through microbial activity. Using column studies at
   room temperature (23-26 degrees C), we investigated the addition of
   lactate and methanol to a depleted manure substrate as a method to
   reactivate a bioreactor that had lost >95\% of sulfate reduction
   activity. A preliminary experiment compared sulfate removal in gravity
   fed, flow through bioreactors in which similar masses of each substrate
   were added to the influent solution. Addition of 148 mg/l lactate
   resulted in a 69\% reduction in sulfate concentration from 300 to 92
   mg/l, while addition of 144 mg/l methanol resulted in an 88\% reduction
   in sulfate concentration from 300 to 36 mg/l. Because methanol was found
   to be an effective sulfate reducing substrate, it was chosen for further
   experiments due to its inherent physical properties (cost, low freezing
   point and low viscosity liquid) that make it a superior substrate for
   remote, high elevation sites where freezing temperatures would hamper
   the use of aqueous solutions. In these column studies, water containing
   sulfate and ferrous iron was gravity-fed through the bioreactor columns,
   along with predetermined methanol concentrations containing reducing
   equivalents to remove 54\% of the sulfate. Following an acclimation
   period for the columns, sulfate concentrations were reduced from of 900
   mg/l in the influent to 454 mg/l in the effluent, that reflects a 93\%
   efficiency of electrons from the donor to the terminal electron
   acceptor. Iron concentrations were reduced from 100 to 2 mg/l and the pH
   increased nearly 2 units. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Metalaxyl (N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-N-(methoxy-acetyl)-D,L-alanine methyl
   ester, C15H21NO4) is extensively used as fungicide, and the resulting
   water contamination is a potential health hazard. The photocatalytic
   decomposition of this fungicide in aqueous suspensions containing TiO2
   yields its complete mineralization. The intermediates formed during the
   photomineralization and the reaction pathways were analyzed by recording
   proton NMR spectra. On the basis of the measurements of total organic
   carbon it was concluded that the rate of metalaxyl decomposition can be
   explained in terms of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model and the

Abstract = {{The future of industrially contaminated land is now a major concern for

   establish an action plan for implementation of measures to mitigate
   health and environmental risks which are unacceptable with respect to
   statutory and non-statutory guidance. In preparation to meet these
   obligations, Newcastle City Council (NCC) have initiated a programme of
   research at Newcastle University to develop a prototype contaminated
   land assessment system (CLASS) to map contaminated land within the city
   boundaries. This system has been developed within the framework of the
   Geographic Information System ARC/INFO. If comprises two main
   components. First; a comprehensive database for identification and
   characterisation of contaminant sources, pathways and targets within
   Newcastle city boundaries. Second, a hazard modelling system to classify
   each site in terms of its future pollution potential. The CLASS system
   will provide a valuable tool for NCC in prioritising future actions such
   as monitoring, site investigation and/or remediation of contaminated
   sites. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The implementation of biological filtration on granular activated carbon
   under various operating conditions has revealed that biodegradable
   organic matter (BOM) removal performance is not easily predicted. In
   this context, the statistical analysis of the differences between
   experimental data and data calculated by a deterministic model may
   provide insight into the source of prediction errors. The CHABROL model,
   developed by Billen et ai (1992, J. Water SRT Aqua 41, 231-241), relates
   BOM consumption to biomass densities in order to predict BOM removal
   profiles in biological activated carbon filters (BAC) and rapid sand
   fillers. This work presents the results of testing the CHABROL model
   using a large database from pilot and full-scale filters located in two
   Canadian cities: Laval and Montreal. This database includes data from
   two different water sources and three biological filtration
   configurations (direct filtration, first-stage dual-medium sand-BAG
   filters and second-stage mono-medium BAC filters). Since nearly half of
   all experimental data were obtained at very low temperatures (less than
   or equal to 1 degrees C), the impact of prolonged acclimation to very
   cold temperatures was investigated to ensure accurate prediction by the
   CHABROL model. Experimental results have shown that modifications in the
   CHABROL model have to be made to account for the acclimation to very
   cold temperature and to prevent under estimations of the BDOC removals.
   The results of the model testing show overall satisfactory results in
   the ability to predict BDOC removals in various types of filters, except
   for the sampling campaigns completed just prior to backwash. This
   comparison shows the interest of using a predictive model to predict
   performance in dynamically operated filters which may be used for design
   and operation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR) was developed to treat dilute
   formulated rinsate of atrazine
   {[}2-chloro-4-(ethylamino)-6-(isopropylamino)-s-triazine] from an
   agricultural chemical formulation Facility. The SBBR was inoculated with
   Agrobacterium bacteria strain J14a. Hydraulic residence times (HRTs) and
   different carbon sources were varied to determine their effects on the
   rate of degradation of atrazine and chemical oxygen demand (COD) by the
   biomass. The degradation rate of atrazine by J14a was enhanced when a
   supplemental carbon source was added. An initial concentration of 30
   mg/L of atrazine with citrate and sucrose as carbon sources was degraded
   to less than 1 mg/L within 12 h for a 2 d hydraulic residence time (HRT)
   at room temperature of 22 degrees C. The first order degradation rare
   constant for 2 d HRT was approximately 0.44 +/- 0.03 h(-1) For a HRT of
   7 d, more than 90\% of atrazine were degraded within 45 h. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The oxidation and mineralization of hexadecane in silica sand slurries
   was investigated using aggressive Fenton,like reactions {[}high
   concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and an iron (II) catalyst]. When
   spiked with 0.1 mmol kg(-1) hexadecane, 56\% of the hydrocarbon was
   sorbed to the silica sand and most of the remaining hexadecane was found
   as nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL). Gas-purge methodology documented that
   hexadecane desorption from the silica sand slurries was negligible over
   72 h. Three process variables {[}hydrogen peroxide concentration, slurry
   volume and soluble iron (II) amendment] were studied to determine their
   effects on hexadecane oxidation. A central composite rotatable
   experimental design was used to determine the most effective oxidation
   conditions as well as possible interactions between variables. In
   addition to investigating the oxidation of the parent compound, parallel
   experiments were conducted using C-14-hexadecane to evaluate its
   mineralization. The recovery of C-14-CO2 confirmed that under the most
   effective conditions (high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and low
   slurry volumes), 83\% of the sorbed and NAPL-phase hexadecane was
   mineralized to CO2 and H2O. The iron (II) concentration had a negligible
   effect on parent compound degradation within the range investigated (5
   to 25 mM) but was a significant variable in promoting the mineralization
   of hexadecane. The results show that under aggressive Fenton-like
   conditions, even a highly hydrophobic compound that is sorbed and in a
   NAPL-phase can be oxidized to its thermodynamic endpoints. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Wastewater treatment objectives are still typically defined in terms of
   nonspecific parameters such as biochemical oxygen demand and total
   suspended solids. However, wastewaters are a heterogeneous mixture of
   materials with a wide range of particle size and molecular weight, and
   most processes involved in treatment (sedimentation, mass transfer,
   adsorption, diffusion, biochemical reactions, filtration) are effected
   by particle dimension. This study deals with the evolution;of the
   particular and dissolved content of synthetic sewage during treatment.
   The experimental system consisted of a pilot-scale low-rate trickling
   filter, with and without secondary settlement, followed by crossflow
   microfiltration (CFMF). In terms of particle size distribution (PSD),
   results show a shift towards larger particle sizes through biological
   filtration, most of which can then be removed by settlement. Some fine
   particles remain and these can be removed by CFMF with a 0.1 mu m pore
   size membrane. High performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC)
   was used to study the evolution of the dissolved fraction of wastewater
   through treatment. Both PSD and HPSEC are shown to be valuable tools to
   assess the performance of wastewater treatment processes. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Hydraulic flocculation has been used for water treatment throughout the
   world for many years and is particularly well suited for developing
   countries. Two types of flocculator are described, a horizontal-flow
   channel system, for which aspects such as retention time, channel slope,
   rapid mixing methods and bathe insertion were assessed and a contact
   flocculation-filter (CFF). Pilot plant tests were carried out over two
   years at Thyolo Water Treatment Works in Malawi using river water with
   crushed seed kernels from the indigenous tree Moringa oleifera Lam. (M.
   oleifera) or aluminium sulphate as coagulant. Both flocculation systems
   were able to reduce turbidity to below the World Health Organisation's
   guideline value of 5 NTU for drinking water from raw water with average
   turbidities during test runs ranging from 15-5600 NTU. The CFF method
   was particularly effective at low turbidities where <1 NTU was attained
   at low dosages (< 25 mg/l) of M. oleifera. ``Flash{''} mixing of
   coagulant using a simple equivalent of an in-line vortex mixer was shown
   to give more efficient treatment than-mixing by alternative methods. M,
   oleifera as coagulant is shown to be feasible for treating river water
   for communities up to small town size and its production close to
   treatment plants would obviate importation of chemicals thus saving on
   foreign exchange, provide economic development of rural communities and
   reduce potential health hazards from chemical overdosing. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The paper investigates the coliform removal in 33 Facultative and
   maturation ponds in Brazil. The ponds were located in different parts of
   the country, with climates ranging from tropical to subtropical and
   latitude from 7 to 24 degrees S. The ponds had different physical
   configurations, temperature and detention times. The total number of
   data used in the study, mostly comprising long-term averages, was 66.
   Two flow regimes were investigated: CSTR and dispersed flow. In the
   dispersed-flow model, the dispersion number was estimated using the
   formulae by Agunwamba ct al. and Yanez, and both were found to give
   similar results. The coliform die-off coefficient K-b was correlated
   with the pond depth and hydraulic detention time in the dispersed-flow
   model (R-2=0.847). A regression equation, using theoretically generated
   data, was proposed, correlating K-b or the CSTR model with K-b for
   dispersed-flow model, using the length-to-breadth ratio and detention
   time of the pond (R-2 = 0.997). Use of this equation yields virtually
   the same removal efficiency values as those obtained directly by the
   dispersed-flow model. Utilisation of the K-b values calculated by the
   proposed regression models gave a very good prediction of the log
   effluent coliform concentration of the 33 ponds (R-2=0.951 for the CSTR
   model and R-2 = 0.959 for the dispersed-flow model). Applying the
   proposed model for dispersed flow, it was concluded that, for a given
   removal efficiency, a shallow pond, due to its larger Kb, requires less
   surface area, compared to a deep pond, even though the latter has a
   higher detention time. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A dynamic mathematical and numerical model has been applied to predict
   concentration profiles over time for adsorption and biological
   degradation of ammonium and sulfide in a perfusion column with recycle.
   The model successfully accounts for the high adsorptive capacity of peat
   (two thirds of ammonium added to the system at pH 6) which makes this
   medium a useful carrier for engineered biological systems such as
   biofilters and biotrickling filters. This characteristic of peat gives
   it significant buffering capacity to protect against surges in loading.
   Solid/liquid partition coefficients were determined experimentally for
   adsorption of ammonium and sulfide onto a peat packing under prevailing
   pH conditions. The dynamics of mass transfer for the same were shown to
   be at least as fast as the dynamics of transport by bulk flow and
   probably very much faster. This enabled mass transfer resistance to
   adsorption and biological degradation to be discounted as negligible.
   The rate of biological degradation of ammonium on peat was found to vary
   between 10 and 80 (mg NH4+) (kg dry peat)(-1) h(-1), depending on the
   alkalinity of the liquid phase. This translated into predicted
   biological growth rates (based on published yields) of 1 to 7 (mg dry
   cell mass) (kg dry peat)(-1) h(-1). Measurement of biological
   degradation rates for sulfide were frustrated by competing chemical
   oxidation of sulfide by dissolved oxygen. It is suggested that aerobic
   sulfide removing biofilters and biotrickling filters may remove sulfide
   by a two step process involving initial chemical oxidation to elemental
   sulfur followed by slower biological oxidation to sulfate. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Elevated concentrations of nutrients, resulting in prolific algal
   growth, were reported in some open-water ponds in one of the finest
   surviving wetlands on the Lower Great Lakes, Point Pelee National Park.
   Ontario, Canada. A study was undertaken to identify the sources of
   nutrients to the most impacted pond in the complex, Sanctuary Pond.
   Sediment chemistry and chemistry of interstitial water were examined to
   determine thr role of benthic sediments in nutrient dynamics. The
   results indicate high concentrations of dissolved nutrients (about 4
   mg/l of P and over 20 mg/l of N) in sediment porewater, a consequence of
   organic matter decomposition. No spatial differences were observed
   between porewater profiles, nor in the levels of dissolved constituents.
   Likewise, sediment P concentrations were similar at both investigated
   sites. Thermodynamic calculations, carried out to determine mineral
   equilibria of phosphate minerals potentially controlling the
   concentrations of dissolved P in sediment porewater, suggest that P
   generated from organic matter decomposition should he reacting with Fz,
   Ca and Al to form authigenic mineral phases vivianite, hydroxyapatite
   and variscite. The high levels of nutrients in porewater, the lack of
   spatial differences in sediment and porewater nutrient concentrations
   and the absence of known external nutrients sources suggest that at the
   Sanctuary Pond internal regeneration of nutrients from sediments is
   responsible for the hypereutrophic conditions in the pond. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Three laboratory-scale upflow anaerobic filters (AFs) containing
   different support media were subject to identical volumetric organic
   loadings and hydraulic retention time in treating synthetic
   protein-carbohydrate waste. The objective was to examine the influence
   of support media on biomass growth and retention and their resulting
   impact on System performance and failure. At the organic loading of 16 g
   COD/l/d, the reactor packed with the support media of open-pored texture
   exhibited 78\% COD removal efficiency attributable to its higher
   retention of attached biofilm. On the other hand. the reactor with
   larger media porosity indicated comparable removal efficiency of 77\%
   attributable to higher growth of suspended biomass, as opposed to a much
   lower removal efficiency of 57\% in the unit associated with media of
   smooth surface and low porosity. Quantitative estimation of the organics
   removed by the biomass suspended within the interstitial void spaces
   showed that about 56-58\% of the methane was produced by the suspended
   biomass in the reactor containing media of larger porosity, while about
   56\% of the methane was produced by the biofilm in the unit associated
   with media of open-pored texture operated at 12 and 16 g COD/l/d. The
   estimation of dead space based on a tracer study indicated that the
   effective volume of the bed was markedly reduced to 43-57\% due to
   accumulation of biomass at the organic loading of 16 g COD/l/d. The
   tracer study also revealed that AF failure at high loadings is likely
   attributed to biomass washout rather than short-circuiting which
   suggests that impact of clogging to anaerobic filter system failure may
   not be as significant as originally thought. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Biotransformation of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons under anaerobic
   conditions has received considerable attention due to the prevalence of
   these compounds;Is groundwater contaminants. However, information
   concerning the impact of mixtures of chlorinated compounds on their own
   transformation is limited. The focus of this research was to investigate
   the effect of combinations of chlorinated aliphatics on transformation
   rates and the role of toxicity to a methanogenic enrichment culture.
   Batch studies using combinations of carbon tetrachloride (CT).
   perchloroethene (PCE) and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA) were
   performed with acetate as the electron donor. CT was transformed most
   rapidly, followed by 1,1,1-TCA and PCE. Rate coefficients for the
   transformation of 1,1,1-TCA and CT were significantly lower when the
   concentration of either compound was increased. PCE transformation was
   limited. and its presence did not significantly impact degradation of CT
   or 1,1,1-TCA. In once-fed batch reactors used to assess the potential
   for toxicity, a transformation limit was observed for both PCE (1.91 +/-
   0.21 mu g of PCE per mg of cells and 1,1,1-TCA (7.84 +/- 0.34 mu g of
   1,1,1-TCA per mg of cells) but not CT. The: low observed limit of
   transformation for PCE. combined with its lack of effect on the
   transformation of the other two compounds. suggest:, that the number of
   PCE-degrading organisms in the mixed culture is low. Transformation of
   repeated CT spikes has been maintained for over 400 days without
   supplementation with acetate, indicating that inhibition, rather than
   potential inactivation, was responsible for the negative impact observed
   when CT is present in mixtures. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   the wastewater. In the experimental work, soluble chemical oxygen demand
   removal rates of 43 g CODs/m(2) d or 3.8 kg CODs/m(3) d were achieved
   and these rates compare favourably with other biofilm systems. The new
   biofilm experimental unit was simple to construct and operate, and was
   very effective in biologically treating the synthetic wastewater used in

Abstract = {{Step and pulse response experiments carried out on large pilot-scale
   nitrifying trickling filters show that adsorption and desorption of
   ammonium, as well as denitrification. may occur in the biofilm. These
   phenomena should then be taken into account when modeling the fast
   reactor dynamics. The observed adsorption and desorption cause the
   transients of the effluent ammonium concentration to become:
   significantly slower than expected from measured residence time
   distributions. Sampling for measurements of stationary nitrification
   rates should then be carried out several mean residence times after
   changes in operating conditions. A physically based model of
   simultaneous nitrification, denitrification, adsorption and desorption
   in the biofilm is presented. Simulated responses to changes in influent
   concentrations agree with the experimental data. From the simulations it
   is also evident that the effects of adsorption on the responses are
   considerable although the actual amounts of adsorbed ammonium are small
   relative to amounts observed for activated sludge. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Midge larvae (Diptera: Chironomidae) are found abundantly (7.4 x 10(4)
   larvae m(-2)) in slow sand filter beds open to the atmosphere. Larvae
   eat the schmutzdecke accumulated at the sand surface and egest faecal
   pellets that are compacted and bound with mucopolysaccharides, faecal
   pellet size increasing with larval size. Pellets become diffuse after
   conditioning by microorganisms, and pellets, whether fresh or
   conditioned, are broken by abrasion. As up to 23\% of the sand surface
   can be covered by fresh faecal pellets each day, midge larvae probably
   play an important role in the functioning of slow sand filters. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The removal of zinc ions from aqueous solutions and electroplating rinse
   effluent by Azolla filiculoides on batch and column studies was
   investigated. The maximum zinc uptake by Azolla in batch systems at an

   filiculoides showed good mechanical stability and flow-permeability in
   repeated column operations. The zinc uptake in column operation at pH
   6.2 and 60\% breakthrough was between 25.8-30.4 mg/g with varying Row
   rates (from 32 to 160 ml/h.g). Complete desorption of bound zinc was
   accomplished with 120 mi of either 0.2 N H2SO4 or HCl. The data from
   regeneration efficiencies for six cycles, evidenced that the reusability
   of Azolla in the treatment of Zn2+-laden wastewater is viable. An
   effluent-free, closed loops of zinc treatment system, with Azolla
   biomass as the sorbent, is proposed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Natural organic matter is an important pool that is not yet totally
   described. Two types of compounds are found: some chemically well
   characterised molecules (biopolymers) and uncharacterised humic
   substances (geopolymers). The spectroscopic properties of this pool of
   organic matter have recently been advanced by the excitation emission
   fluorescence matrix (EEFM) {[}Coble, G. P. (1996) Characterization of
   marine and terrestrial DOM in seawater using excitation-emission matrix
   spectroscopy. Marine Chemistry 51, 325-346.]. Three types of
   fluorophores are described by their excitation/emission wavelength at
   maximum intensity (lambda(ex)/lambda(em))(max): the tyrosin and
   tryptophan like structures, not examined here, and the humic like
   fluorescent structures of type A (lambda(260)/lambda(445)) and type C
   (lambda(330)/lambda(445)) The EEFM applied to sequential tangential
   ultrafiltered (UFTS) amazonian fresh waters give spectroscopic
   information on the fluorescent properties of particulate (>0.22 mu m),
   colloidal and dissolved (< 5 kDa) organic matter. Chromophores A and C
   are present in all sized fraction samples. Their
   (lambda(ex)/lambda(em))(max) are in the same domains as those of
   terrestrial humic substances {[}Seritti, A., Morelli, E., Nannicini. L.
   and Del Vecchio. R. (1994) Production of hydrophobic fluorescent organic
   matter by marine diation Pheodactylum tricornutum. Chemosphere 28(1),
   117-129; Coble, G. P. (1996) Characterization of marine and terrestrial
   DOM in seawater using excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy, Marine
   Chemistry 51, 325-346.]. Differentiation of the type A and type C peaks
   in 3D diagrams are based on their (lambda(ex)/lambda(em))(max) position
   and the I-a/I-c ratio. Differences are observed between humic material
   extracted by hydrophobic resins or concentrated sample from tangential
   sequential ultrafiltration (UFTS). Spectroscopic properties of the humic
   material are not modified by the ultrafiltration process. A particular
   attention is given on the differentiation between black water (Rio Negro
   River) and white water (Rio Solimoes and Rio Madeira River). Black
   waters are generally known as humic rich and low mineral content waters.
   EEFM analysis on these two types of water lead to the following
   conclusions: (i) the humic like fluorescent compounds of type C are
   preferentially retained by membranes with 5 kDa cut off. These compounds
   have the larger molecular weight. (ii) In the presence of copper cation,
   the type C compounds are divided in two groups according to their
   (lambda(ex)/lambda(em))(max): the First one is invariant, the other one
   expands (20 nm) its efficient excitation wavelength domain. (iii)
   Photochemical reactions induced by UV irradiation also lead to a 20 nm
   expansion of the efficient excitation wavelength domain. From these
   spectroscopic and molecular weight complementary data, it is proposed
   that A type fluorophores are close to fulvic acids while C fluorophores
   seems to be more related to humic acid. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Concentrations of trifluoroacetate (TFA) in the environment are expected
   to increase because It is an atmospheric degradation product of CFC
   replacement compounds that will receive widespread use. TFA possesses
   high watts solubility and its movement in the biosphere will be closely
   linked with the hydrologic cycle. Surface waters and sediment pore
   waters will receive loadings directly through precipitation and runoff
   and indirectly via soil-and ground-water inputs. Studies were conducted
   to assess whether TFA could be metabolized under aerobic conditions by
   microbial communities in freshwater surface sediments. Sediment samples
   were collected to a depth of 2.3 mm from flowing-water mesocosms in
   which organisms were pre-exposed to 30 mu g TFA/l over a 2.5 year period
   and from control mesocosms that received no TFA. The sediment-associated
   microbial communities were tested for ability to incorporate of
   2-{[}C-14]TFA (added at 43 mu g/l) in time course experiments. The
   communities pre-exposed to TFA in the mesocosms showed a low, but
   statistically significant. level of radiolabel incorporation. The
   cell-specific rate of incorporation for communities sampled From the TPA
   mesocosms increased nearly 20-fold during the 2.5 fear experiment, from
   1.15 x 10(-13) to 2.22 x 10(-12) mu g.cell(-1).day(-1). Communities from
   the control mesocosm never showed statistically significant
   incorporation. Communities pre-exposed to TFA for similar to 1.5 years
   also incorporated {[}C-14]TFA when exposed to concentrations as low as 2
   mu g/l. Our results indicate a low level of incorporation of the
   xenobiotic TFA by natural microbial communities and thus their potential
   to serve as a point for TFA to enter into the food web. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Lack of marine toxicity data for most pesticides currently in use
   severely restricts the ability of environmental scientists to predict
   the impacts of discharges to the marine environment. This paper reviews
   the available aquatic toxicity data for a total of 18 pesticides and an
   additional 19 non-pesticide organics. Eleven of these compounds were
   chosen because of their use for external parasite control on sheep, the
   remaining compounds were chosen based on the availability of Mysid
   shrimp toxicity data. The sheep ectoparasiticides were chosen as other
   work, at the Wool Research Organisation of New Zealand (WRONZ), has been
   assessing the toxicity of woolscouring wastewater. A high correlation
   (R-2=0.945, n = 9) was found between published Mysidopsis bahia (96 h
   LC50) toxicity data and those of Daphnia spp. (48 h EC50), after
   transforming the data to log mu mol/l. Further extending the database to
   include non-pesticide organics did not adversely affect this correlation
   (R-2=0.941, n = 28) or alter the slope of the correlation curve. These
   high correlation coefficients indicate that acute Daphnia spp. toxicity
   data may be able to be used to predict Mysid shrimp (M. bahia)
   sensitivities, thus providing a risk assessment tool for use in marine
   or estuarine situations. It was also apparent that Mysids are generally
   more sensitive to organics that Daphnia. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The following review article will serve to elucidate the existing
   state-of-the-art and breadth of technical understanding related to
   thermophilic aerobic biological wastewater treatment. The advantages of
   this technology include rapid biodegradation rates, low sludge yields,
   and excellent process stability. Substrate utilization rates reported in
   the technical literature are 3-10 times greater than that observed with
   analogous mesophilic processes, and sludge production rates are
   generally similar to anaerobic treatment processes. As such,
   thermophilic aerobic treatment has been used to biodegrade wastewaters
   from the pulp and paper industry, livestock production, and many other
   miscellaneous waste streams. Thermophilic aerobic processes are
   particularly advantageous fdr the treatment of high-strength wastewaters
   that can fully benefit from the rapid biodegradation rates and low
   sludge yields. High-strength wastewaters also contain the necessary
   energy content to facilitate autothermal operation such that exogenous
   heat input is not required. A theoretical energy balance is presented
   which predicts that COD removals of 20,000-40,000 mg l(-1) coupled with
   an oxygen transfer efficiency of 10-20\% are necessary for autoheating
   to thermophilic temperatures. Of the bacteria likely to proliferate in
   thermophilic aerobic bioreactors, relatively unique and specific
   nutritional requirements are common. In particular, thermophilic
   Bacillus spp. commonly exhibit a growth requirement for methionine. Most
   researchers have reported that thermophilic bacteria fail to aggregate,
   making biomass separation from the treated effluent a key design
   criterion. Further work on thermophilic aerobic treatment processes is
   also needed to identify optimum operating conditions, and determine the
   best method to accommodate the oxygen uptake rates of these systems. (C)

Abstract = {{The Mai Po Marshes Nature Reserve (Hong Kong) which is one of the most
   important regional wetland habitats, is under increasing pollution
   pressure, such that the existence and survival of the natural biota,
   including many endangered species, is threatened. Water quality in the
   tidal shrimp ponds (locally called gel wais) of the marshes was so poor,
   that biological impacts arising from the release of contaminants from
   the underlying sediments were suggested. A study was conducted to (i)
   investigate the level of contamination of underlying sediments in Gei
   wai 13, (ii) examine the effects of environmental factors on the
   behavior of contaminants in the sediments and (iii) study the toxicity
   of the sediments. Sediment in Gei wai 13 was contaminated with nutrients
   and heavy metals, of which nitrogen and phosphorus tend to bind to
   coarser particles, while copper, nickel and zinc to finer ones (silts
   and clays). Mobility of nitrogen and phosphorus from the sediment
   increased with increasing levels of salinity and temperature of the
   overlying water. In respect of the drying effect, the solubility of
   nitrogen and phosphorus of air-dried sediments was lower than that of
   wet sediments. Sediment extract toxicity tests indicate, that the highly
   contaminated sediment resulted in a low toxic level and toxic responses
   were detected only by bioassays of amphipods and algae, but not by the
   Microtox(R) test. The low toxicity is consistent with the low soluble
   content of contaminants of pore water and the low bioavailability of
   contaminants in sediments. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The decolourisation of cotton bleaching effluent by a wood rotting
   fungus was studied. It was found that fungus No. 7 could remove more
   than 70\% of the colour (initial A(400) = 2.0-2.4) from the effluent
   within 4 days under agitated conditions. The fungal mycelia could be
   reused for a prolonged time and the decolourisation activity of mycelial
   pellets was quite stable during a long period of cool storage. Many
   factors affecting the decolourisation process were studied, including:
   concentration of glucose, effluent, NH4+ and Mn(II); initial pH;
   temperature. The activity of manganese peroxidase (MnP) appeared to
   correlate well with the decolourisation rate. After the fungal
   treatment: an improvement in the treatability of the effluent by other
   microorganisms was observed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The filtration phenomena of O/W emulsion, baker's yeast suspension and
   PMMA particle suspension were studied using microfiltration membranes.
   The effect of the relationship between membrane pore size, operating
   pressure and particle types on filtration performance-was investigated.
   The permeation flow of various suspensions was directly visualized using
   a microchannel cell and a microscope video system. The emulsion
   particles broke through the microchannel with increasing operating
   pressure because of their compressibility, even though they could not
   permeate at low pressures. Baker's yeast and PMMA particles deposited at
   the entrance of the microchannel and plugged the channel. These
   particles were no longer permeable through the microchannel in spite of
   an increase in the pressure. These behaviors of various particles
   dependent on the pressure were also recognized with filtration
   experiments using ceramic microfiltration membranes. In the filtration
   of emulsion, the optimum membrane pore size was about 0.2 mu m for
   obtaining a complete rejection of emulsion and a high permeate flux. The
   specific resistance of the cake layer of various particles was also
   calculated with the cake filtration model. The specific resistance of
   the emulsion was 500-3000 times greater than that of other particles and
   similar to the high specific resistance of a protein (ovalbumin) gel
   layer. The emulsion resistance increased correspondingly to the increase
   in the operating pressure. It was also necessary for the emulsion to be
   filtered at low pressures for complete rejection and higher flux. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, a pilot plant is presented providing the treatment of low
   volume, high ionic strength wastewaters by advanced oxidation processes,
   such as UV/O-3, UV/H2O2 and UV/O-3/H2O2. The plant is equipped with a
   bubble column to dissolve gaseous ozone and a special designed thin-film
   photoreactor, which enables the photoinitiated degradation of organic
   compounds of high optical density without any contact to the radiation
   source. The thin-film apparatus was applied to model solutions
   containing humic acid in order to remove the TOC in dependence on the
   operating conditions. In addition, a leachate of a waste landfill has
   been treated containing high concentrations of toxic compounds, e.g.
   chlorinated phenols, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated
   biphenyls and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzo-p-furans.
   The application of UV/O-3 has been proved to be an effective technique
   for the treatment of leachate resulting in degradation ratios of 100\%
   for both phenols and hydrocarbons, 23-96\% for biphenyls and at least
   74\% for dioxins and furans. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The bacterial population from activated sludge samples of a pulp and
   paper mill was investigated. Analysis of colonies on plates count,
   including Gram stain, cells and colonies morphology, cytochrome oxidase
   and catalase reactions, revealed the presence of four main bacterial
   groups with a major one. The presence of this main population (24.90\%
   to 64.80\% of the total population) was followed during one year at the
   rate of one two-months sampling. The taxonomic study of several isolates
   and use of rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes led to the
   identification of Arthrobacter sp., with a marked rod-coccus
   Gram-positive growth cycle, catalase-positive and oxidase-negative
   reactions and obligately aerobic non-motile cells. L-lysine was
   identified in the cell wail peptidoglycan and the \% G + C of the DNA
   was about 72.0 (Tm). The presence of Arthrobacter sp. in the wastewater
   treatment system had a singular character. Moreover, these bacteria were
   devoid of cellulolytic, amylolytic and proteolytic activities. The
   preservation of biofloc efficiency seems to be the main function of
   these bacteria. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This bench-scale research investigated the controlling factors for
   simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) in a 2-stage,
   intermittent aeration (IA) process, designed for nitrogen and phosphorus
   removal. The 2-stage process consisted of an anaerobic zone followed by
   an oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) controlled, intermittently
   aerated, completely mixed (IACM), tank. The three independent variables
   examined were the average ORP level, organic substrate (acetate and
   methanol) dosage and aeration cycle. The sewage used was completely of
   residential origin. Nitrogen balance clearly indicated that the nitrogen
   loss, due to SND in the aeration tank, contributed 10\% to 50\% of the
   influent TKN to the overall nitrogen removal. Significant differences in
   both nitrification and denitrification in the IACM tank were observed,
   when different average ORP levels were applied to the aeration control;
   this proved that absolute ORP can be used as a real-time control
   parameter for SND. Under low DO and intermittent aeration conditions,
   acetate and methanol additions improved nitrification over the entire
   dosage range and denitrification at relatively low dosages. Finally, a
   longer aeration cycle, with a zero-DO period, appeared to favor
   sequential nitrification and denitrification (SQND), not SND. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{A method for optimizing the selection of river sampling sites is
   presented. Procedures using a geographical information system (GIS),

   possible sampling sites are severely restricted and (iii) for monitoring
   an impounding catchment with problem inflows. Optimization of sampling
   site location by simulated annealing is shown to be adaptable to a
   variety of practical situations and to perform better than the

Abstract = {{An attempt to help solving the pollution problem caused by the presence
   of reactive dyes in textile effluents, was undertaken. Owing to the fact
   that eucalyptus bark is a very abundant, inexpensive, forest residue in
   the authors' country, Portugal, it was decided to experiment with it as
   a potential adsorbent for a certain type of the supracited pollutants
   used in cellulose fibers dyeing (Remazol BE). In order to study the
   variables that define the process, 2(4) and 2(5) factorial
   experimentations were carried out, in two stages. In the first one, the
   variables selected were: temperature, initial pH, sodium chloride
   concentration and initial dye concentration/bark concentration ratio. As
   tests showed that the last parameter did not describe the adsorption
   process, another stage followed, keeping the first three variables and
   substituting initial dye concentration and bark concentration separately
   for their ratio. It was verified that all the variables studied had
   significant influence on the adsorption process at the level of 1\%
   probability. The influence order was: initial dye concentration > bark
   concentration > initial pH > sodium chloride concentration >
   temperature. Parallel adsorption tests, under similar conditions,
   carried out with a commercial activated carbon and with eucalyptus bark,
   showed for the last one an adsorption capacity about half of that of the
   first one. It is considered that the obtained results are quite
   encouraging, though there is still a long way to go before definitive
   conclusions may be withdrawn. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Using sequential ultrafiltration (UF) of Amazonian surface waters,
   several fractions, defined by the molecular weight (MW) cut-off of the
   UF membranes, can be obtained: < 5000 Dalton (Da) (or < 5 K), 5000 Da <<
   20,000 Da, 20,000 Da << 100,000 Da, 100,000 Da << 0.2 mu m and 0.2 mu m
   << 0.45 mu m fraction: the first one can be regarded as ``true
   solution{''} while the others define colloidal classes. The metal
   binding capacity of these fractionated samples, using differential
   anodic pulse stripping voltammetry (DPASV), Cu(2+) ion selective
   electrode (ISE) and H(+) ISE procedure reveal that the 20,000 Da <<
   100,000 Da fraction is the most efficient fraction for copper binding.
   The potentiometric results show pK(Cu) spectra with one major peak near
   the 3 to 4 pK(Cu) range in all fractions and several quite lower
   intensity peaks for higher pK(Cu) values for the largest colloidal
   fractions only. The pK(a) distributions show pK(a) ranging from 3 to 4
   and from 9 to 10, with intermediate smaller peaks. Concerning proton
   available sites, the results show that functional groups of organic
   colloids develop a weaker acidity for the low molecular weight organic
   compounds. The maximum proton available site density has been observed
   for the smallest molecules (< 5000 Da) larger molecules show lower
   proton available site densities. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The catalytic oxidation of organic compounds in aqueous phase is a
   promising technique for waste water treatment. Obtaining efficient and
   durable catalysts and determining the optimal process conditions are the
   key to successfully implementing this treatment. Copper-based catalysts
   supported over either silica or gamma-alumina were prepared for this
   purpose. This research studies the influence of the pH on the
   performance of these catalysts. Activity tests were conducted for nine
   days in a trickle bed reactor operating at 140 degrees C using air as
   oxidant. The results show that the silica supported catalyst is very
   sensitive to the acidic medium which leads to very short lifetimes. At
   first, the alumina supported catalyst also quickly losses activity but
   subsequently it stabilises with a residual phenol conversion several
   times higher than that of the silica supported catalyst. For both
   catalysts, a higher pH reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation by
   preventing the leaching of the copper oxides and lengthening their
   lifetime. The atmosphere (air or nitrogen) during calcination does not
   change their performance. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The distribution of treated water of good quality can generate in many
   cases the formation of unwanted loose deposits in the reservoirs and
   pipework of distribution systems. The approach used in this study seeks
   to characterize the organic component of deposits in a large
   distribution system, since organic matter is a key factor in controlling
   the biostability of water and has not previously been described with
   relation to these deposits. Deposits were found to contain a variable,
   but minority fraction of organic matter: less than 11\% as organic
   carbon, 1.1\% as nitrogen, or 28\% as volatile solids, but the
   corresponding concentrations were much higher (g l(-1)) than those found
   in circulating water (mg l(-1)). The same ratio applies to bacterial
   counts. Proportions of C-organic and N were linked through a linear
   relationship, which results in a consistent C/N ratio close to 7
   irrespective of the quantity of or ganic matter in the sediment. This
   low C/N value suggests that the in situ biological activity has a strong
   influence on the C and N fractions. This is confirmed by (i) the high
   heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) in the deposits (up to 5.8 x 10(8) CFU
   14 d g(-1) of dry matter); (ii) the observation of a mature trophic
   chain in most samples resulting in the presence of macro-organisms
   (Asellus, Gasteropodae), in some cases, and (iii) positive correlations
   between the organic matter fractions (as C-organic and N) and the HPC.
   No relationship was found between the organic characteristics of
   deposits and upstream/downstream locations in the system. The deposits
   appear to contain a reserve of organic matter capable of supporting the
   development of bacteria as well as bacterial predators, which is likely
   to provide favourable conditions for the contamination of water carried
   by the distribution system. Chlorine demand of loose deposits was high
   and would be predicted from nitrogen content, but inactivation of
   bacteria associated with resuspended deposits appears unfeasible with
   current disinfection practices due to oxidant reduction resulting from
   deposit resuspension. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The performance of three black box models which were parameterized and
   validated using data collected from a laboratory scale fluidized bed
   anaerobic digester, were compared. The models investigated were all ARX
   (auto regressive with exogenous input) models, the first being a linear
   single input single output (SISO) model, the second a linear multi-input
   multi-output (MIMO) model and the third a nonlinear neural network based
   model. The performance of the models were compared using correlation
   analysis of the residuals (one-step-ahead prediction errors) and it was
   found that the SISO model was the least able to predict the changes in
   the reactor parameters (bicarbonate alkalinity, gas production rate and
   \% carbon dioxide). The MIMO and neural models both performed reasonably
   well. Though the neural model was shown to be superior overall to the
   MIMO model, the simplicity of the latter should be a consideration in
   choosing between them. A simulation with an horizon approaching 48 h was
   performed using this model and showed that although the absolute values
   differed significantly, there were encouraging similarities between the
   dynamic behavior of the model and that of the fluidized bed reactor. (C)

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Fifty nine surface sediment samples from the Ria Formosa lagoon were
   analysed for lipid biomarkers and 26 sterols were identified and
   quantified using a CC-MS technique. The total concentrations ranged from
   0.1 to 27.8 mu g g(-1) DW although this accounted for much less than 1\%
   of the total organic carbon content. The principal sterols were
   cholesterol and beta-sitosterol indicating marine fauna and terrestrial
   plants, respectively. Sewage markers (coprostanol and epi-coprostanol)
   were present around the known sewage discharge points at Fare, Tavira
   and Olhao; the former two sites had untreated effluent whereas the
   latter site has partially treated discharges which was reflected in an
   increase in the epi-coprostanol/coprostanol ratio. Phytoplankton
   biomarkers (e.g. brassicasterol) were concentrated in the region near
   Armona, the major inlet to the lagoon from the Atlantic Ocean. Sterols
   indicative of other types of organic matter were also present but were
   restricted to selected regions. Multivariate statistical techniques
   (PCA, PLS) were able to produce readily explainable diagrams which
   highlighted the contribution that each of the major sources, marine
   fauna, sewage, phytoplankton and terrestrial organic matter made to the
   sites of the lagoon. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bromate (BrO3-), an anion with carcinogenic properties, may be present
   in drinking water when bromide-containing water is ozonated during
   treatment or when it is present in surface water used as the source.
   Experiments showed that the concentration of BrO3- was reduced in a
   denitrifying bioreactor supplemented with ethanol, when NO3- was almost
   completely removed. At BrO3- concentrations of 25 and 35 mu g/l and a
   temperature of 12 degrees C the removal rates were 0.6 and 0.8 pg l(-1)
   min(-1), respectively. Calculations based on bromate concentration
   profiles in the bioreactor revealed that contact times of 25-50 min will
   be necessary to obtain concentrations below 3 mu g/l, the 10(-5) cancer
   risk level. Furthermore, intensive post treatment of the filtrate is
   required to remove biomass and excess ethanol applied for complete
   denitrification. Therefore, bromate removal in a denitrifying bioreactor
   does not seem to be a realistic option in drinking water treatment. Soil
   passage under anoxic conditions as occurring during artificial recharge
   or river bank filtration may enable BrO3--removal from (ozonated)
   surface water. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A multidisciplinary study was conducted to predict water quality in the
   Lot River and to estimate the impact of nutrient inputs on algal
   production: measurement surveys, estimation of nutrient inputs,
   hydraulic modeling and biological modeling. This paper presents the
   biological model that simulates the evolution in phytoplankton
   (chlorophyll and biovolume), nutrients (N-NH4, N-NO3, P-PO4) and
   detrital elements (N and P) in the developed stretch of the river (300
   km). The model takes into account the measured or estimated nutrient
   inputs. The variables calculated by the hydraulic model, such as
   illumination and water temperature, are introduced by forcing. The model
   was first calibrated with measurements taken in a series of dynamic
   water mass monitoring studies, during the low-water periods of 1991 and
   1992. The simulations correctly reproduce evolution in the different
   variables measured on site, through a broad range of low-water flow
   values (from 9-94 m(3) s(-1)), with a single set of coefficients. We
   then chose three scenarios to attempt to evaluate the impact of a
   modification in nutrient inputs: large-scale connection of towns to
   sewage treatment plants and improvements in their efficiency; the
   consequences of saturation of existing sewage treatment plants; the
   simultaneous effects of stratification of the deep downstream reaches
   and of high nutrient inputs linked to summer tourism activities. (C)

Abstract = {{Tertiary or pretreatment of dyeing effluents by advanced oxidation
   processes (AOP) catalyzed by a source of UV light and a powerful oxidant
   is a promising alternative for the effective removal of color and
   refractory organics from the effluent. A crucial feature in designing
   such systems is the optimization of operating conditions (such as UV and
   oxidant dosages), which yield maximum removal at acceptable costs. The
   present study describes a modeling approach to keep the oxidant dosage
   at the most `'effective{''} level to sustain maximum rate of dye removal
   at the selected experimental conditions. The method of study involved
   monitoring the rate of dye degradation in a synthetic azo dye solution
   of nearly constant concentration during irradiation by a medium pressure
   light source and varying H2O2 dosages, followed by predicting a
   mathematical relation between the pseudo-first order rate constant and
   the ``effective H2O2 level{''} in the photoreactor. It was found that
   this ``effective level{''} can be set by controlling the initial mass
   ratio of H2O2 to dye, or the light fraction absorbed by hydrogen
   peroxide within the UV emission spectra of the light source. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The transport of bacteria in contaminated aquifers over a distance of
   only one meter can require tens to thousands of unsuccessful collisions
   of bacteria with soil grains. Previous work has shown that low ionic
   strength (IS) solutions and the nonionic surfactant Tween 20 can reduce
   bacterial adhesion to ultraclean surfaces such as glass and quartz
   porous media. In this study, we examined whether these results could be
   generalized to soils and to other surfactants, by measuring the
   retention of two species of radiolabeled microbes over short (1 cm)
   distances in soil minicolumns. Calculations were also made, using the
   clean-bed filtration theory, to evaluate if bacterial transport
   distances are sufficient for bioagumentation to occur over a large
   region of the subsurface. Collision efficiencies were expressed using
   the filtration model in terms of the sticking coefficient, alpha,
   defined as the fraction of collisions that are successful. In glass bead
   columns, alpha's for monoclonal populations were reduced from alpha =
   0.19 (Alcaligenes paradoxus) and alpha = 0.01 (CD1), to alpha < 0.008
   for Tween 80-phosphate buffer solutions and alpha < 0.0054 for low ionic
   strength (0.01 mM) solutions (Darcy velocity, U = 10(-3) m s(-1):
   Hammaker constant = 10(-20) J; and fluid properties of water at 22
   degrees C). Low alpha's were also obtained using other nonionic
   surfactants (Tween 80, Triton 100 and 705, POE-10, Brij + 35) and an
   anionic biosurfactant, all added at concentrations above their critical
   micelle concentration (CMC). Although sticking coefficients were also
   reduced by an order-of-magnitude for natural soils, sticking
   coefficients remained too high to permit wide dispersal of cells over
   distances of >1 m. For A. paradoxus, alpha was reduced using a low ionic
   strength solution from 0.72 to 0.083 for the Arizona soil and from 1.7
   to 0.2 for the Ringold soil; for CD1, alpha was reduced from 0.57 to
   0.09 for the Ringold soil. Based on the soil grain diameters of these
   soils (127 mu m, Arizona soil; 224 mu m, Ringold soil), alpha's in this
   range will permit transport distances (defined as 99.9\% reduction in
   cell concentration) of similar to 1 m (U = 10 m/d, 10 degrees C) which
   may be sufficient for creating small, bioactive zones. However, in order
   to increase bacterial transport over distances >1 m, methods other than
   simple solution chemistry changes will be needed to enhance aquifer
   bioaugmentation operations. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Freshwater fluvial suspended sediment particle size characteristics
   alter temporally when allowed to stand, undergoing continuous
   aggregation to form larger composite particles (aggregates or flocs)
   that can settle from the water column and are stable to hand shaking.
   Treatments to inhibit the spontaneous aggregation of laboratory prepared
   and fluvial suspended sediments were investigated. A novel method using
   formaldehyde to fix suspended sediment was developed, which inhibited
   aggregation of the suspended particles. The formaldehyde-treated
   particle suspensions formed fragile aggregates on settling, but they
   were redispersed by hand shaking. When assessed by particle size
   distribution, photography and turbidity measurements following
   resuspension, treatments with 2\% (v/v) formaldehyde showed little
   alteration of the initial existing particles or aggregate composition
   and turbidity. The fixation of fluvial water samples with formaldehyde
   immediately after collection allowed the transportation and storage of
   the samples containing suspended sediment for laboratory analysis, weeks
   after collection. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The biological aerated filter (BAF) combines both biological treatment
   and solids removal in one submerged, aerated three phase reactor. Over
   the last 20 yr biological aerated filters have been developed not only
   as competitors for other secondary treatment systems such as trickling
   filters and activated sludge plants but also as tertiary treatment
   systems. The aim of this work was to compare the performance of two such
   reactors, one containing a floating media and the other containing a
   sunken media under identical conditions during start-up and with
   increasing hydraulic flowrates. Two methods of start-up were used. The
   first method used activated sludge as seed which was recycled through
   the reactor, the second method involved simply passing the process
   liquid (settled domestic sewage) through the reactor at the initial
   flowrate. Following a period of steady-state the flowrates were
   increased incrementally and the performance of the reactors analysed
   during and after each increase. The results for the start-up indicated
   that the overall time to reach steady-state using both methods was
   approximately the same but due to the initial time required for the
   recycling of the activated sludge, this method took slightly longer.
   From an initial start-up loading of 0.486 kg m(-3) d(-1) (SS) and 0.568
   kg m(-3) d(-1) (sCOD) suspended solids and soluble chemical oxygen
   demand removal efficiencies dropped to below 50\% when loadings of 1.397
   kg m(-3) d(-1) (SS) and 1.403 kg m(-3) d(-1) (sCOD) were reached. The
   floating media performed better at the higher flowrates under shock
   loading conditions than the sunken media. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{In Full scale experiments, the denitrification capacity of secondary
   clarifiers and measures to increase it were evaluated. Due to a higher
   activated-sludge concentration and a lower scraper velocity, the sludge
   mass and thus the denitrification capacity in the secondary clarifier at
   the WWTP Zurich-Werdholzli was significantly increased. During the
   investigated period, the denitrification in the clarifier represented
   37\% of the total denitrification, corresponding to 19\% of the total
   inlet nitrogen. The main part was denitrified in the inlet channel of
   the clarifier, so that doubling the scraper interval increased the
   denitrification in the clarifier by only about 14\%. An approach for
   modelling the sludge blanket volume was developed on the basis of
   measurements of the sludge-blanket height along the rectangular
   clarifier with transverse flow and vacuum-removal scrapers. The limiting
   sludge-volume load was calculated from sludge settling tests and
   compared with observed loads on the full-scale clarifier. Activated
   sludge model No. 2 was verified with the nitrate and ammonium profiles
   in the activated sludge ranks, return sludge and clarifier effluent. (C)

Abstract = {{The United States Environmental Protection Agency routinely use the
   sub-tropical mysid Americamysis (= Mysidopsis) bahia (Peracarida:
   Mysidacea) in laboratory testing to measure the toxicity of contaminants
   and to assess the potential hazards of toxic chemicals to the natural
   aquatic environment. The use of A. bahia in laboratory toxicity testing
   has extended to Europe, however, there is increasing interest in using
   indigenous species for predicting toxicity hazards to European waters.
   Neomysis integer (Leach) is the most common member of the hyperbenthic
   fauna of Western European estuaries and has been proposed as an
   alternative to the standard American species (A, bahia) for toxicity
   testing. Adult N. integer were exposed to chlorpyrifos and dimethoate
   (both widely used organophosphate pesticides) in flow-through and
   semi-static acute toxicity tests. Neomysis integer was more sensitive to
   chlorpyrifos (96 h LC50 of 0.13 mu g chlorpyrifos l(-1)) than dimethoate
   (96 h LC50 of 540 mu g dimethoate l(-1)). Juvenile N, integer, collected
   within 24 h of release from ovigerous females, were equally tolerant to
   chlorpyrifos as adult mysids (96 h LC50 of 0.19 mu g chlorpyrifos
   l(-1)). Gas chromatographic analysis of chlorpyrifos in the water
   samples revealed that considerable degradation or loss (> 50\%) occurred
   within 24 h in the semi-static exposure vessels, highlighting the
   advantages of flow-through testing facilities. Although the 96 h LC50
   for chlorpyrifos was higher for N, integer than for A. bahia (e.g. 0.035
   mu g chlorpyrifos l(-1)), it was comparable with those of other
   frequently-used test species (0.1-6.0 mu g chlorpyrifos l(-1)). The
   results support the use of N. integer as an alternative to A. bahia for
   the testing of toxicants and the evaluation of toxic contamination
   events in European estuaries. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study examined the relationship between ThOD and COD for a database
   of 565 organic chemicals comprising 64 classes. A mixed beta-normal
   distribution was used to develop a statistically reliable method to
   estimate COD from ThOD for specific classes of organic chemicals. The
   data were divided into six groups; (1) well-correlated aromatic
   chemicals, (2) well-correlated non-aromatic chemicals, (3) potentially
   well-correlated aromatic chemicals, (4) potentially well-correlated
   non-aromatic chemicals, (5) other aromatic chemicals, (6) other
   non-aromatic chemicals. The results show there is 90\% statistical
   confidence that COD will be within the range of: 0.96-1.0 x ThOD (mean
   equal to 0.98) for the chemical classes in group 1; 0.92-1.0 x ThOD
   (mean equal to 0.97) for the chemical classes in group 2; 0.80-1.0 x

   x ThOD (mean equal to 0.92) for the chemical classes in group 4. The COD
   for chemicals in groups 5 and 6 was either poorly correlated or could
   not be correlated because insufficient data were available. COD cannot
   be estimated from ThOD for the 43 chemical classes represented by the
   288 chemicals in groups 5 and 6. Caution should be used in applying COD
   measurements to these chemical classes or to mixtures which consist
   primarily of chemicals contained in these chemical classes. In addition,
   a modification of the COD test may be required for individual chemicals
   contained in this poorly correlated group of chemical classes (e.g.,

Abstract = {{Cadmium(II) adsorption properties of pre-treated biomass (PTB) of marine
   alga Durvillaea potatorum were investigated. Pre-treatment of the native
   biomass with calcium chloride and subsequent thermal treatment
   considerably improved the swelling properties and physical stability of
   the biomass granules. Batch and column experiments were conducted to
   determine the adsorption properties of the modified biomass. The
   adsorption capacity of the biomass strongly depends on equilibrium
   solution pH. At solution pH of 5, the maximum adsorption capacity of the
   pre-treated biomass is 1.1 mmol/g. The kinetics of cadmium adsorption
   was fast with 90\% of adsorption taking place within 30 min. The
   feasibility of using pre-treated biomass granules in a packed bed was
   also examined. This study demonstrated that the pre-treated biomass of
   D. potatorum can be used as an efficient biosorbent for the treatment of
   cadmium bearing waste streams. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The relative merits of untransformed root-transformed, root
   root-transformed and binary data for the discrimination of sites of
   varying water quality was investigated using macroinvertebrate data from
   the river Trent system in England. The influence of these four data
   treatments was investigated using the CLUSTER, ANOSIM and SIMPER
   programmes of the PRIMER computer software package. In general, the
   results showed that relative abundance is important in distinguishing
   between the more heavily polluted sites, which have poor faunas. In
   contrast, the down-weighting of abundant taxa, through the use of data
   transformations or binary data allows for a more effective
   discrimination of richer sites. The root root-transformation can be
   recommended over the other data treatments as it offers a good
   compromise between untransformed and binary data, and as it allows for
   the effective discrimination of sites over a wide range of water
   qualities. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{351-360}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Ex situ soil washing is commonly used for treating contaminated soils by
   separating the most contaminated fraction of the soil for disposal.
   Surfactant-enhanced soil washing is being considered with increasing
   frequency to actually achieve soil-contaminant separation. In this
   research eight anionic and nonionic surfactants were evaluated for the
   enhanced soil washing of three different soils contaminated with
   petroleum hydrocarbons. Enhanced soil washing occurred at surfactant
   concentrations below and above the CMC indicating the occurrence of both
   soil rollup and solubilization mechanisms. In certain cases the lower
   CMC of nonionic surfactants made them attractive candidates while in
   other cases the lower sorption and higher solubilization potential of
   select anionic surfactants made them the preferred choice.
   Surfactant-induced foaming and turbidity are operating considerations
   that can also impact surfactant selection. When selecting a surfactant
   for a given soil-contaminants system we thus recommend evaluating both
   anionic and nonionic surfactants at concentrations below and above their
   CMC, and we suggest that the methodology we describe in this paper is a
   good approach for making the final surfactant selection. (C) 1998

   254 nm and photoreactivation. The conclusions obtained in this study can
   be summarized as follows. (1) The dose of UV light required for 90 and
   99\% inactivation of EHEC O157:H7 was 1.5 and 3.0 mW s cm(-2),
   respectively. (2) The dose of UV light required for 90 and 99\%
   inactivation of EHEC O26 without photoreactivation was 5.4 and 8.1 mW s
   cm(-2), respectively. (3) Apparent photoreactivation with visible light
   from a fluorescent lamp was observed in EHEC O26 but not in EHEC
   O157:H7. (4) The dose of UV light required for 90\% inactivation of EHEC
   O26 after photoreactivation was 12.0 mW s cm(-2) (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{There are many different methods available for analysing the results of
   tracer studies on the aeration lanes of activated sludge plants. If the
   results are to be used for modelling then it is necessary to calculate
   the number of tanks in series to allow the dispersion within the tanks
   to be accurately modelled. Two methods for this are presented in this
   paper and both are based on Levenspiel's work. The WRc method calculates
   the number of tanks in series but provides information on
   short-circuiting only by visual inspection of the residence time
   distribution (RTD) curve. The Martin method produces information on mean
   residence time and number of tanks in series for a number of separate
   flow ``strands{''} through the tank. Ln this way, ``short-circuiting{''}
   can be parameterised in a manner consistent with mathematical models of
   the activated sludge process. Other methods for analysing RTD curves,
   whilst giving useful information on the flow regime within the tanks,
   are not suitable for use in dynamic models of wastewater treatment. (C)

Abstract = {{A miniaturised continuous flow method for the determination of free or
   combined chlorine in purification plant water has been developed. The
   method is based on the standard batch procedure which uses a phosphate
   buffer for pH adjustment and N,N'-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) as a
   colorimetric reagent. The sample, the reagent and the buffer Solutions
   are continuously pumped into a miniaturised flow system. The mixing, the
   thermostating and the chemical reaction take place in a manifold with an
   engraved zigzag flow channel. A flow through detector is positioned at
   the flow channel outlet. The flow channel volume is about 25 mu l and
   the detector volume is 0.25 mu l. An experimental design was performed
   revealing that the significant variables were the total flow rate and
   the length of the mixing channel. Based on the results from this
   experimental design a total flow rate of 90 mu l/min and a channel
   length of 60 mm were selected. The total consumption of sample and
   reagent is less than 3.91 per month when the system is operated
   continuously. The response time is less than 2 min. When combined
   chlorine, in essence chloramine, is determined, potassium iodide is
   added to the buffer solution. The limit of detection is 3.2 mu M for
   free chlorine and 1.9 mu M for monochloramine. (C) 1998 Published by

Abstract = {{The effect of different concentrations of additives on the settling
   properties of two types of activated sludge were evaluated by means of a
   Settlometer. In addition to the evaluation of the immediate positive
   effect of the additive, a method consisting of consecutive cycles of
   resuspension and evaluation of the settling properties, is proposed to
   study the stability of the beneficial effect of the additive. First, a
   sludge from industrial origin was supplemented with talc and with a
   polymer. Subsequently, a sludge from domestic origin was tested. Both
   additives were successful in improving the sedimentation characteristics
   of the sludges. The effect of talc was stable over a period of at least
   14 h. However, the positive effect of the polymer was transient because
   after 4 h the beneficial effect disappeared. The experimental results
   from the talc addition were analysed by means of a physical model. The
   latter revealed that the observed increase of the initial settling
   velocity is smaller than but close to the increase related to the
   specific weight of the floc. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The variations in activated sludge flee structure, size and size
   distribution were studied for different dissolved oxygen (DO)
   concentrations in pilot scale completely mixed reactors. The size
   distribution by volume for Aocs larger than about 10 mu m fitted well to
   log-normal distribution functions. No clear relationship between DO
   concentration and average flee diameter could be found; there was only a
   trend towards larger flocs at higher DO concentrations. Lower DO
   concentrations (0.5-2.0 mg/l) produced sludge with poorer settling
   properties and higher turbidities of the effluent than higher DO
   concentrations (2.0-5.0 mg/l). The main reasons to the deteriorated
   settling properties were excessive growth of filamentous bacteria and
   the formation of porous flocs. Alternating aerobic and anaerobic
   conditions (1-4 h) did not affect the settling properties to a large
   extent. The turbidity increased significantly during the anaerobic
   period and decreased during the aerobic period. The supernatant was also
   analysed with a particle analyser. During alternating aerobic/anaerobic
   conditions, the proportion of smaller flocs (2-20 mu m) increased
   gradually during the anaerobic periods. Directly after that the oxygen
   supply was turned on, the number of small flocs decreased. In most of
   the measurements, more than 80\% of the number of flocs in the
   supernatant were smaller than 2 mu m. The size distribution of small
   Aocs could best be fitted to power functions. The number of flocs in the
   supernatant could relatively well be related to the turbidity. (C) 1998

   in phototactic behavior as a variable for the detection of stress caused
   by pollutants. We selected D. magna genotypes with a stable and
   predictable phototactic behavior in presence and absence of fish
   kairomones. Two clones were positively phototactic in absence of fish
   kairomones (clone C(1)34 and C(1)242). and two clones (C(1)242 and
   C(1)31) showed no significant change in behavior in response to Fish
   kairomones. Using a simple experimental set-up, we quantified the
   changes in phototactic behavior of adult animals of the positive
   phototactic clone C(1)34 in response to two standard pollutants, Cu2+
   and pentachlorophenol (PCP). Sublethal concentrations of Cu2+ and PCP in
   ISO standard medium resulted in a linear decrease of the phototactic
   behavior of clone C(1)34 after 3.30 h. The detection iii-nit for changes
   in phototactic behavior of clone C(1)34 was 0.045 mg l(-1) for Cu2+ and
   0.8 mg l(-1) for PCP. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effects of ionic chromium, cadmium, lead, copper, zinc, and nickel
   on the methanogenic UASB granule were examined by using serum bottle
   assays. Granular seed sludge was acclimated with a mixture of acetic
   (HAc), propionic (HPr) and butyric (HBu) acids. According to those
   results, the metal effects relied on the kinds of metal, zones of
   sludge, types of volatile fatty acid (VFA) and hydraulic retention time
   (HRT). The relative toxicity of the metals to total VFA degradation was
   Cu > Cr > Cd is approximately equal to Zn > Ni much greater than Pb for
   both bed and blanket sludges; however, different degrees of toxicity
   were observed for individual VFAs and sludges. For the degradation of
   total VFA, the copper toxicity resistance of blanket sludge was lower
   than that of the bed sludge. The biogranules' VFA degradation activity
   reduced by 50\% for the biomass that came into contact with 26-3200 mg/L
   of the tested metals. Compared with an UASB acidogenesis process, the
   biogranules in the methanogenesis process exhibited a higher sensitivity
   to metal toxicity than the biogranules in the acidogenesis process.
   However, in the biogranules of methanogenesis process the HPr- and
   HBu-degrading acidogens were more sensitive in activity to copper than
   HAc-degrading methanogens. Besides, long HRT increased the toxicity
   resistance of HAc-degrading methanogens but decreased that of HPr- and
   HBu-degrading acidogens. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{LC/APCI/MS was used as a multiresidue analytical method for determining
   the thermolabile and/or polar pesticides in treated water and its raw
   water for water supply, which are not amenable to a routine GC/MS
   procedure. Of the 31 thermolabile and/or polar pesticides including 14
   neutral or basic pesticides and 17 acidic ones used in this study, the
   detection limits for neutral/basic pesticides detected in positive-ion
   mode ranged from 10 to 50 mu g/l and the limits for acidic pesticides
   detected in negative-ion mode ranged from 50 to 250 mu g/l except for
   dicamba (500 mu g/l) and benazolin (1000 mu g/l). The structural
   information was significantly improved through an in-source
   collision-induced decomposition (CID) process. The solid-phase
   extraction (SPE) procedure, which used a special cartridge with its
   upper part filled with polystyrene/divinylbenzene and the lower part
   filled with carbon molecular sieve. was developed for extraction of the
   pesticides. The extraction recoveries of the pesticides were found to be
   higher than 72\% in treated water and 67\% in raw water except for
   thiophanatemethyl and sethoxydim, which were impossible to recover from
   treated water and raw water and were recovered at a recovery of 60 and
   64\%, respectively, in distilled water. When the multiresidue analytical
   method was applied to field analysis for Niigata public waterworks
   treatment plant in Japan, 8 pesticides were detected in treated water
   and 10 ones in its raw water. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An early warning system, called ECOTOX, for monitoring the quality of
   water has been developed using different movement parameters of the
   motile unicellular flagellate Euglena gracilis as end points. The
   ability of orienting in the gravity field, the motility and the velocity
   of the cells were found to be sensitive to a number of toxic compounds.
   The biomonitor is controlled by a real time image analysis system which
   quantifies the movement parameters. Statistically significant changes in
   the measured parameters indicate a change in the tested water quality.
   The biomonitoring system works fully automatically and in a very short
   time. One cycle including a sample and control measurement takes between
   6 to 10 min (depending on the software settings). For a number of toxins
   EC50 values have been calculated using the most sensitive end point.
   which is usually the gravitactic orientation. The toxic potential of a
   seepage water From an industrial waste deposit has been tested. G-values
   (lowest dilution Factor of the tested water, where no significant toxic
   influence can be measured) have been determined. ECOTOX can be employed
   to detect quality changes in effluents and aquatic ecosystems and to
   indicate whether aquatic life may be endangered. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The study of the oxidation of glycine by ozone and hydroxyl radicals has
   been undertaken. Different experimental procedures involving the H2O2/UV
   process or ozone in the presence of hydrogen peroxide on one hand, and
   ozone alone on the other hand allowed to distinguish between the two
   oxidation pathways. It has been shown that nitrites and nitrates are
   observed byproducts resulting from molecular ozonation whereas ammonium
   ions constitute the only inorganic nitrogen species from hydroxyl
   radicals induced decomposition of glycine. Therefore, the ozonation
   process promoting radical pathways will favor ammonia production vs.
   nitrates. Among the organic compounds resulting from oxidation by
   hydroxyl radicals, oxalic acid was the major byproduct detected in the
   presence of oxygen. Oxamic acid and formic acid were also observed. In
   addition, the nitrogen mass balance indicated the formation of
   unidentified nitrogen byproducts derived from glycine, These nitrogen
   compounds could result from the interaction of oxygen with nitrogen
   radical, but, mainly, with a-amino radical of glycine. This reaction is
   very different from the molecular ozonation which directs the attack on
   the nitrogen functional group before the C-N bond cleavage of the amino
   acid molecule. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An electronic nose consisting of twelve polypyrrole conducting polymer
   sensors was evaluated for its ability to monitor quiescent sewage
   liquors at three wastewater treatment works. Samples collected from the
   works inlet. the settlement rank and the final effluent outlet over an
   8-month period, showed that a non-specific sensor array can distinguish
   between sewage samples of different type and from different treatment
   works. The correlation of the electronic nose responses with the 5-day
   biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) using canonical correlation (a
   statistical reduction technique), showed that no generalised
   relationship can be found between these parameters for raw sewage,
   settled sewage and final effluent samples from three treatment works.
   However. when samples From a single works are compared separately,
   strong correlations can be produced between the electronic nose
   responses and BOD5 for time intervals of approximately 4 weeks. These
   relationships show that it is possible to fit single lines between the
   response patterns of an electronic nose and BOD5 for sewage samples at a
   single treatment works. The results suggest that it may bt:feasible to
   use an electronic nose to monitor and/or control the biochemical
   activities of a wastewater treatment process. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{An electronic nose based on a non-specific conducting polymer array was
   evaluated against sewage odour concentrations From ten sewage treatment
   works. Sensor responses from the twelve sensor array were compared using
   canonical correlation (a data reduction technique) with threshold odour
   numbers (TON) made by dynamic dilution olfactometry. The results suggest
   that for sewage odours from a range of locations within different
   treatment works, no universal relationship is present, whereas a strong
   correlation can be produced between TON and the electronic nose
   responses (as represented by a canonical variable) for sewage odours
   from a single works. Further correlations were achieved between the
   odour potential of a liquid sewage and the NOSE output of a quiescent
   sewage liquor. Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) concentrations, commonly used as
   measures of odour strength, were also compared with TON and found not to
   be a good marker compound for measuring these sewage odour
   concentrations. The results demonstrated the ability of an electronic
   nose to respond to sewage odours over a range of odour concentrations
   (125-781066 odour units/m(3)) and suggest the potential application of
   such an instrument to monitor odour emission;in a sewage works, as well
   as assessing the efficiency of odour abatement units. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Title = {{Development and validation of a flux-based stoichiometric model for
   enhanced biological phosphorus removal metabolism}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{462-476}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) is a wastewater treatment
   process involving metabolic cycling through several biopolymers
   (polyphosphate, polyhydroxyalkanoates. and glycogen). This metabolic
   cycling is induced in microorganisms by treatment systems that alternate
   between initial carbon-rich, anaerobic environments followed by
   carbon-poor, aerobic environments. While the appearance and
   disappearance of these biopolymers has been documented, the
   intracellular pressures that lead to their synthesis and degradation are
   not well understood. To understand how carbon, energy, and redox
   potential are channeled through the metabolic pathways in each treatment
   process stage, a metabolic flux model that contained a complete set of
   the pathways involved in biomass synthesis and energy production in
   bacteria was developed. The model accounts for the energy requirements
   of macromolecule synthesis and of metabolite transport across the cell
   membrane, The equations for the 163 reversible and 166 irreversible
   reactions were solved using linear optimization. Data from a laboratory
   scale sequencing batch reactor performing EBPR were used as model
   inputs. Given polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis and glycogen degradation
   rates in the anaerobic phase, the model predicted reasonable anaerobic
   acetate uptake and polyphosphate consumption rates. In the aerobic
   phase, the polyphosphate and glycogen synthesis rates were used to
   predict the polyhydroxyalkanoate consumption rate. In addition, the
   model predicted the ratio of acetate uptake to phosphate release
   observed experimentally, as well as an inverse relationship between
   polyhydroxyalkanoate and polyphosphate consumption. The model provides
   information on the pathways by which the energy-rich molecules ATP,
   NADH, and NADPH are produced and consumed during the EBPR processes. In
   doing so, it supports the hypothesis that biopolymer metabolism provides
   a means for organisms to balance intracellular energy supplies.
   Moreover. the model suggests pathways at which metabolic regulation
   should occur and provides a comprehensive account of EBPR metabolism.

Abstract = {{Brominated trihalomethanes (Br-THMs) such as CHCl2Br, CHClBr2. and CHBr3
   are produced by the reaction of hypobromite with humic acid in the
   presence of hypochlorite. In the presence of excess NaOCl, addition of
   NaOBr enhanced the formation of Br-THMs but reduced the formation of
   CHCl3. The product distribution of THMs was affected by the ratio of
   {[}NaOBr]/{[}NaOCl] and was independent of pH and reaction time. In the
   presence of excess NaOBr, the yield of CHBr3 only increased linearly
   with the NaOCl concentration added. However, the other three THMs were
   hardly-produced even though NaOCl concentration was increased up to 0.5
   of the {[}NaOCl]/{[}NaOBr] molar ratio. Our results suggest that in the
   process of THM formation, hypochlorite ion reacts effectively with humic
   acid in the oxidation reaction and hypobromous acid plays a predominant
   role in the electrophilic substitution when both of hypohalites are
   present. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In waste-water treatment plants with enhanced biological phosphorus
   removal (EBPR), a part of the phosphorus can be eliminated by chemical
   precipitation. In experiments with inactivated sludge containing
   relatively high concentrations of dissolved calcium (approximate to 1.5
   mol m(-3)) and phosphorus (approximate to 1 mol m(-3)), a pH-sensitive
   and partly reversible precipitation of calcium phosphates was observed
   at pH values below 8.0. A dynamic model was formulated on the basis of
   these observations. It contains, in addition to equilibrium equations
   for the deprotonation(s) of phosphoric acid, carbonic acid acid water,
   the following reactions: (1) Fully reversible precipitation of
   hydroxydicalcium phosphate (Ca2HPO4(OH)(2), HDP) as an intermediate. (2)
   Formation of hydroxyapatite (Ca-5(PO4)(3)OH, HAP) from HDP. HAP is
   regarded as a kinetically stable product. A parameter estimation
   performed for the surface complex HDP predicts a solubility product of
   10(-22.6)M(5) (20 degrees C) and a heat of dissolution (Delta H-298) Of
   -88.4 kJ mol(p)(-1): If the solubility of HDP is exceeded, then

Abstract = {{The degradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) by electrochemical oxidation in
   the presence of carbon black (CB) was studied in a laboratory reactor.
   This reactor consisted of a stack of Ti/Pt electrodes. After the mixing
   of the solution to be treated with CB, the slurry electrode thus
   obtained flows through the electrode grids. The reaction pathways and
   kinetics were studied by means of high performance liquid chromatography
   coupled with a UV detection, ionic chromatography coupled with a
   conductimetric detection and gaseous chromatography coupled with mass
   spectrometry. The reaction pathways were thus determined: after the C-Cl
   bond breaking, phenol and chloride ions were detected in the solution.
   The formation of 2-chlorophenol was also detected. The influence of the
   amount of CB used on the degradation yield of 4-CP was also studied. The
   full mineralisation of 4-CP could be reached if CB was present in a
   sufficient amount and, in this case, no chlorine was detected. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Marine dissolved organic material ({''}marine DOM{''}, Mediterranean
   Sea) and a well characterized soil fulvic acid ({''}SFA{''}, Conway)
   were extracted using tCl8 Sep-Pak cartridges. The extracts were
   characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy before and after reverse
   phase high performance liquid chromatographic fractionation (RP-HPLC).
   Based on soil fulvic acid, the tC18 Sep-Pak extraction procedure led to
   a loss of 65\% of the fluorophores at lambda(ex) 350 nm, and 34\% of
   those at lambda(ex) 450 nm, yet with no alteration in wavelength maxima:
   similar behavior was obtained for the marine DOM. Conventional
   fluorescence emission showed that the SFA fluorescence is 2.5 times
   higher than that of the marine DOM at lambda(ex)/lambda(em) 350/452 nm
   and 11 times higher at lambda(ex)/lambda(em) 450/522 nm. The higher
   fluorescence emission of the SFA in relation to the marine DOM can be:
   attributed to compounds of high polarity. A blue shift was obtained when
   comparing the emission maximum of marine DOM (lambda(em) 437 nm) to that
   of SFA (lambda(em) 452 nm) at a fixed excitation of 350 nm, whereas no
   significant difference was obtained when excitation was fixed at 450 nm.
   Several distinct classes of fluorophores were detected in both marine
   DOM and SFA by the synchronous excitation technique:
   lambda(ex)/lambda(em) 317/335 nm and 486/504 nm are present in the SFA,
   and lambda(ex)/lambda(em) 352/370 nm and 566/584 nm in the marine DOM.

Abstract = {{Treatment of an emulsified polymeric wastewater was investigated using
   sedimentation and coagulation. Settleability studies and jar tests were
   conducted in order to investigate the effect of sedimentation and
   coagulation on treatment of the wastewater, respectively. The effect of
   alum, ferric chloride and ferrous sulphate as coagulants on the
   treatment of samples collected from two different discharged streams was
   studied. The results of the settleability studies showed that the
   wastewater of both streams were insettleable. The jar tests revealed
   that the wastewater of the first stream was best treated when 200 mg/l
   of ferric chloride were dosed at pH 9. At optimum conditions, the
   turbidity and COD of the wastewater were reduced by 99.6 and 99.3 per
   cent, respectively. Alum was found to produce the best results with
   wastewater of the second stream, when 250 mg/l were used at pH 9. Al
   optimum conditions, turbidity and COD were reduced by 96.3 and 95.9\%,
   respectively. The COD of the treated wastewater is well below the limit
   set by the regulatory authority, hence, the wastewater can be discharged
   to the biological treatment plant of the industrial city. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{This work is focused on assessing the potentialities of Lemna gibba in
   the treatment of metal polluted wastewaters. This was done by evaluating
   the effects of various metals on plant growth, bioaccumulation and
   organic pollutant removal rate. In particular, several experiments were
   carried out using synthetic wastewaters contaminated with Al-III, Cu-II,
   Cr-VI, Fe-III and Zn-II at various concentrations. It was found that
   wastewaters containing organic load with Fe-III (up to about 20 mg/l),
   Zn-II (up to about 20 mg/l) and Al-III (less than 30 mg/l) do not affect
   the performance of a treatment based on Lemna gibba. On the other hand,
   concentrations of chromium higher than about 0.1 mg/l and copper larger
   than about 1 mg/l have a detrimental effect on the plant performance.

Abstract = {{The present work is part of an experimental study carried out in a
   completely filled gravity pipe, 61 km long, which transports reclaimed
   urban wastewater (RUWW), for crop irrigation with an average water
   residence time of 42 h, in the island of Tenerife (Spain). Field studies
   were conducted from November 1994 to June 1995. H2S generation has been
   observed in the pipe when anaerobic conditions appear. A direct relation
   between sulfide generation and the organic matter measured as COD has
   been seen. S(II) build-up in this pipe is compared with the predicted
   S(II) according to equations proposed by Boon and Lister (1975),

Abstract = {{According to Valderrama (1981) aquatic samples are successfully digested
   with peroxodisulphate prior to total nitrogen determination. This study
   compares the utilization of a microwave oven and an autoclave for the
   preparation of liquid samples in terms of precision and accuracy of the
   obtained recovery. The comparison encompasses both reference solutions
   such as urea, amino acids, nucleic acids and recalcitrant compounds as
   well as natural water samples. Although the observed differences are
   small, the microwave digestion technique proofs significantly more
   precise. On the other hand, biases introduced by each of the techniques
   are similar. The slightly but significantly better precision and its
   easy utilization on board research vessels make the microwave digestion
   technique highly recommendable. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A mixed culture biofilm was developed with a sulfur oxidising,
   heterotrophic bacterium Thiosphaera pantotropha autotrophic nitrifiers
   and other heterotrophs in a three stage rotating biological contactor
   (RBC). Specific benefits due to peculiar properties of T. pantotropha of
   simultaneous heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification
   were derived in the reactor investigated for a combined carbon and
   nitrogen removal from a synthetic domestic sewage. The first stage
   biofilm which contained T. pantotropha showed high COD and NH4+-N
   removal rates of 5.8-14.1 g COD/m(3).d and 0.47-1.1 g N/m(2).d for the
   corresponding loading rates of 6.9-20.7 g COD/m(3).d and 0.69-2.09 g
   N/m(2).d, respectively. Contrary to the conventional units designed for
   a concurrent carbon removal and nitrification, the nitrification rates
   increased linearly with an increase in organic loading rate before
   stabilising at about 1 g N/m(2).d corresponding to a COD loading rate of
   about 15 g/m(2).d and a nitrogen loading rate of 1.5 g N/m(2).d showing
   a change in the order of reaction from first to zero. A simultaneous
   nitrogen removal of 20-68\% was also obtained. The system's performance
   indicated that a single stage aerobic biofilm can be developed to meet
   the increasingly stringent regulations on effluent nitrogen discharges
   affording several advantages over the conventional systems, e.g. low
   buffer requirements, no need for external carbon source for
   denitrification, etc., which may result in substantial reduction in the
   treatment cost. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{562-574}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Phenol-induced cells of Acinetobacter species were used to degrade 4-
   and 3-chlorophenols (CP). Several different patterns of batch 4- or 3-CP
   degradation were shown by cultures growing in different concentration
   ratios of phenol (growth substrate) to 4- or 3-CP, e.g, complete
   degradation of 4- or 3-CP at the depletion of phenol. partial 4- or 3-CP
   degradation at the depletion of phenol and inhibition of both phenol and
   3-CP degradations, These patterns are characteristics of
   concentration-dependent substrate competition/inhibition between phenol
   and CP. As the initial concentration ratio of phenol/4-CP reduced,
   decreasing values of the cell growth yield were obtained from each batch
   experiment. Two different values of a critical concentration ratio were
   necessary to completely degrade 4- and 3-CP in the presence of phenol;
   below these ratios, the initial amount of 4- or 3-CP was only partially
   degraded. The 3-CP transformation product toxicity, as opposed to the
   absence in phenol/4-CP, might have accounted for the requirement of a
   higher critical phenol/3-CP concentration ratio than that for
   phenol/4-CP. Furthermore. higher COD accumulation (2.38 mg COD mg(-1)
   3-CP vs 1.27 mg COD mg(-1) 4-CP) but less chloride release (0.13 mg Cl-
   mg(-1) 3-CP vs 0.26 me Cl- mg(-1) 4-CP) was obtained in phenol/3-CP
   experiments. These results suggest that the cometabolic degradation
   pathways for 4- and 3-CP may differ at the monooxygenation step such
   that the overt 3-CP transformation product toxicity could be attributed
   to accumulation and autopolymerization of 3-chlorocatechol. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{A wide range of strains of white rot fungi have been shown to be
   effective in the decolourisation of a chemical industry effluent
   containing a diazo-linked chromophore. The five most effective strains
   were selected for further study, all could give ca. 70-80\%
   decolourisation. Of these the best were strains of Coriolus versicolor,.
   All five strains could decolourise the effluent at 5-40\% v/v in
   nitrogen-limited medium. The greatest \% decolourisation occurred at low
   effluent concentration but the initial rate and final extent of
   decolorisation Was greatest at 40\% v/v. At best, colour reductions of
   119 and 147 absorbance units (at lambda(max)) were achieved in 3 and 7
   days, respectively. The presence of added manganese ions did not affect
   decolourisation although it did stimulate production of a red side
   product by some fungi. These results demonstrate the potential of white
   rot fungi in the treatment of chemical industry wastes. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The potential of coal fly ash was studied as a catalyst in the air
   oxidation of aqueous sodium sulfide (Na2S) solutions in the temperature

   10(-2) kmol/m(3). The effects of fly ash loading, source of fly ash,
   speed of agitation, air flow rate, fly ash particle size were also
   studied. Experimental results suggested a film-diffusion controlled
   reaction mechanism and 4\% Ay ash loading intensified the reaction rate
   by a factor of 3.5 over that of without fly ash at 303 K. The
   deactivation of the catalytic effect of fly ash was found to be less
   than 31\% even after fifth repeated uses. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{599-608}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this study, an innovative process of using sulfur:limestone
   autotrophic denitrification (SLAD) for treatment of nitrate-contaminated
   surface or wastewater was put forward. The feasibility of this SLAD
   process was evaluated using lab-scale batch reactors operated under both
   aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Autotrophic denitrification occurred
   in batch reactors spiked with sulfur:limestone (S:L) under either
   aerobic or anaerobic conditions at both high (ca. 300-500 mg NO3--N/l)
   and low (ca. 30 mg NO3--N/l) initial nitrate concentrations.
   Nitrate-nitrogen removal increased with the addition of granular sulfur
   and limestone. while the addition of a seed of autotrophic denitrifiers
   into the batch reactors accelerated nitrate removal. Limestone was
   necessary to control the pH within the reactors. The optimum
   sulfur:limestone ratio was 3:1 (v/v) and the extent and rate of nitrate
   removal depended on the alkalinity within SLAD batch reactors. Nitrate
   removal efficiency, sulfate production and biomass accumulation were
   usually higher under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions.
   Bacterial counts signified that both autotrophic denitrificans and
   nondenitrifying bacteria such as Thiobacillus thiooxidans were involved
   in the process under aerobic conditions. The SLAD process may be a
   replacement for heterotrophic denitrification in pond systems such as
   constructed wetlands or stabilization ponds due to the fact that no
   organic carbon source is needed in the SLAD process and that autotrophic
   denitrificans exist widely in natural sediments dr soil. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Post-treatment of effluent from an Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket
   (UASB) reactor, that was fed with domestic sewage, was conducted in an
   integrated pond system. The system consisted of a series of shallow
   duckweed and stabilization ponds. The main objective of post-treatment
   is removal of bacterial pathogens and further polishing of effluent
   quality. Rapid and efficient pathogen removal can be achieved in shallow
   stabilization ponds but their effluent BOD and TSS is relatively high,
   due to presence of algae. Passing stabilization pond effluent through
   duckweed ponds was expected to remove algae due to reduced light
   penetration. Duckweed ponds have revenue generating potential since the
   produced biomass can be used as animal fodder. However. when applied
   separately, their pathogen removal is poor. A pilot plant system with an
   overall retention time of 4.2 days, was tested for this purpose. This
   system consisted of 10 ponds in series, arranged ill 3 stages. The first
   stage consisted of 2 duckweed ponds the second stage of 3 stabilization
   ponds and the third stage of 5 duckweed ponds. The system's effluent
   median fecal coliform count in two experimental periods of 6 months was
   3.3{*}10(2)-5.0{*}10(3) per 100 mi. Increasing the retention time of the
   stabilization ponds to 3-4 days is suggested for consistently satisfying
   the WHO criterion for unlimited irrigation. Rapid removal took place in
   the stabilization ponds. A first order fecal coliform decay constant K-d
   was calculated for each of the three stages. The values obtained were
   0.7-3.2, 4.0-5.9 and about 1.4 d(-1), respectively. The shading by the
   duckweed cover in the last stage proved to be able to remove practically
   all algae. Therefore, an excellent effluent quality with respect to TSS
   was achieved (11 mg/l). It was demonstrated that duckweed
   biomass-production and wastewater treatment for reuse in irrigation can
   be achieved in one simple system. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In the U.K., the water resources of many catchments are heavily managed
   and the existing constraints on their use must be built into future
   management. Recent developments in catchment modelling mean that the
   practical use of models, to analyse catchment behaviour and assist with
   the management process, is a feasible option. However, few models
   include appropriate water management components that will permit
   application to those areas for which they are most needed. This paper
   describes the integration of simple management controls into a spatially
   distributed hydrological model and illustrates how the model can be used
   to assist in catchment management, through a case study of the Carron
   catchment in Central Scotland. The model was successfully applied to
   predict how in both the upland region of the catchment. where there are
   several reservoirs and significant transfers of water and the lowland
   region of the catchment, which is a predominantly urban area. A simple
   modification to the water management procedures illustrates how the
   model may be used to help achieve naturalisation of the dow regime, thus
   satisfying the requirements of the precautionary principle. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Accumulation of toxic nitrite is frequently observed during waste water
   treatment. In this study, a model biocommunity was established to
   investigate alterations in the population of nitrate reducing bacteria
   affecting the reduction of nitrate and nitrite. The model biocommunity
   contained a Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes strain. which reduced nitrate
   to N2O or N-2 without any nitrite accumulation, Bacillus niacini which
   reduced nitrate with nitrite as an intermediate and a Staphylococcus sp.
   strain which reduced nitrate only to nitrite. The influence of substrate
   and culture conditions on the composition of the denitrifying
   biocommunity is described. An almost complete denitrification without
   accumulation of nitrite was found in a bacterial community containing
   balanced ratios of nitrite producing and nitrite reducing bacteria. Such
   populations were obtained at low C/N ratios (C/N ratio of 2.5 or below)
   and at an optimal hydraulic retention time of 3 days. Longer hydraulic
   retention times resulted in increasing portions of the nitrite
   accumulating Staphylococcus sp. and subsequently in incomplete
   denitrification. Hydraulic retention times of 1.5 days or less required
   a large excess of the carbon source to obtain complete denitrification.
   In populations dominated by Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, high
   denitrification rates were obtained even at oxygen concentrations as
   high as 5 mg l(-1). Complete denitrification with N2O or N-2 as the only
   products was also found in biocommunities dominated by B. niacini These
   populations showed however a limited efficiency with respect to nitrite
   reduction. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with an experimental study describing the treatment of
   landfill leachate by means of a pilot-scale reverse osmosis unit.
   Leachate streams with a CO parameter in the range of 0-1749 mg l(-1)
   have been adopted. The flux rate of the permeate through the membrane
   decreased linearly with the COD factor. The rejection coefficient of COD
   was practically independent of the COD value, but was significantly
   affected by the applied pressure. By operating at 53 aim; COD rejection
   values around 98\% were obtained. Finally, the effect of COD on th:
   separation of some heavy metals was investigated. For most metals this
   influence was negligible. Only the rejection coefficient of Zn decreased
   significantly upon increasing the COD of the leachate stream. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The biodegradation of olive oil and the treatment of the lipid-rich wool
   scouring wastewater were studied under aerobic thermophilic (65 degrees
   C) conditions using the newly isolated strain Bacillus thermoleovorans
   IHI-91. In a continuously operated laboratory-scale stirred-tank reactor
   olive oil was degraded to more than 90\% at a residence time of 2 h with
   a maximum volumetric degradation rate of 900 mg l(-1) h(-1). A
   relatively high maximum biomass yield of 1.05 g dry cell weight per g
   olive oil consumed was measured and a maintenance coefficient of 0.04 g
   olive oil(g DCW)(-1) h(-1) was calculated from steady-state data. A
   severe growth inhibition was observed when the feed olive oil
   concentration was increased to more than 4 g l(-1). Lipid removal from
   the highly loaded wool scouring wastewater (COD of 77000 mg l(-1)) was
   20-30\% at a residence time of 10-20 h while the COD removal was
   15-20\%. GC-MS analysis revealed that longchain fatty acids up to C18
   were efficiently degraded while degradation of the predominant
   sterol-fraction of the wool grease was not detected. The high
   concentrations of volatile fatty acids (60 mM acetic acid, 13 mM
   propionic acid) present in the wastewater were completely removed even
   at residence times of 2 h. Compared with data from mesophilic processes
   the lipid degradation rates obtained under thermophilic conditions are
   extremely high. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Photocatalytic oxidations of methanol, ethanol and chloroform,
   trichloroethylene (TCE), and dichloropropionic acid (DCP) in M/TiO2
   aqueous slurries are studied. In the presence of oxygen, the
   intermediates of methanol oxidation, such as formaldehyde: and formic
   acid, were not detected by GC in the slurries of TiO2, Pt/TiO2, or
   Pd/TiO2, and CO2 was the only product detected. The distribution of
   intermediates for ethanol photocatalytic oxidation varies with different
   catalysts: under the same reaction conditions, the ratio of
   acetaldehyde:acetic acid is 30:1 on TiO2, and 0.23:1 on Pt/TiO2, with
   the acetaldehyde concentration being 130 limes higher or. TiO2 than on
   Pt/TiO2. Thus, a further oxidation is achieved easily on the Pt/TiO2.
   The CO2 production depends on the initial reaction pH: Acidic pH
   produces CO2 immediately in alcohol oxidation, but alkaline pH retards
   the mineralization substantially. Little effect of Pd metallization on
   TiO2 was observed for photocatalytic oxidation of chloroform, TCE or
   DCP. Pt/TiO2 only enhances DCP dechlorination and has no effect on its
   decarboxylation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although the presence of hepatotoxins in surface and drinking water is
   regarded as an ecotoxicological and human health problem, limited
   knowledge exists on the fate of these compounds. Therefore the
   n-octanol/water distribution ratio (D-ow) of the hepatotoxin
   microcystin-la (MC-LR) was determined in order to enable the prediction
   of the fate of this compound in the aquatic environment. The presence of
   two free ionizable carboxyl groups and one free ionizable amino group in
   MC-LR suggest that its speciation and partitioning between octanol and
   water is pH dependent. This was experimentally studied and confirmed in
   the present study. The log D-ow of MC-LR decreased from 2.18 at pH = I
   to -1.76 at pH = 10. From the low log D-ow values, especially at the
   basic pH region at which the toxin producing cyanobacteria flourish, a
   low tendency to bioconcentrate from water in biota can be expected. (C)

Abstract = {{2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) was successfully and completely
   degraded in a two-stage anaerobic-aerobic biological process in which
   the initial step was conducted anaerobically, resulting in the reductive
   dechlorination of the target compound to 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP),
   and then 4-chlorophenol (4-CP). Stoichiometric conversion of 2,4,6-TCP
   to 3-CP was achieved. The latter compound was then attacked and
   completely degraded aerobically in a second stage. The effects of
   parameters such as temperature and pH were determined for individual
   components of the process. The process was studied in serum bottles and
   shake flasks, and in anaerobic and aerobic bioreactors operating in both
   batch and continuous modes. A sequential anaerobic-aerobic bioreactor
   system was assembled, in which complete 2,4,6-TCP degradation was
   achieved. A mathematical model was developed to describe both anaerobic
   and aerobic processes, and the complete system. The model assumed that
   2,4,6-TCP and 2,4-TCP could be anaerobically attacked according to a
   sequential irreversible reductive dechlorination reaction scheme based
   on Michaelis-Menten kinetics. A. similar model was used to quantify
   aerobic degradation. The kinetic parameters for each step wen: obtained
   in independent batch experiments with suspended cultures, and were
   internally consistent. The model was able to predict the experimental
   results, which lends validity to the postulated kinetics mechanism. (C)

Abstract = {{As part of an extended project to illustrate how :heavy metals are
   complexed by natural aquatic particles, we conducted various experiments
   to study the adsorption of fulvic acid (FA) at aqueous illite surfaces
   and the complexation of heavy metal copper(II) in illite-FA
   bi-complexant systems. By analyzing batch adsorption and potentiometric
   titration data, we found that (i) the adsorption of FA by illite
   decreases with increases in pH values and its pH adsorption edge
   resembles those of SiO2-FA and montmorillonite-FA systems described by
   other researchers, (ii) it is possible to effectively simulate the
   complexation of Cu2+ ions in illite-FA bi-complexant systems by taking
   it to be an additive complexation of two mono-complexant systems
   (FA-Cu2+ and illite-Cu2+) and (iii) FA can inhibit the retention of
   heavy metals at solid surfaces by forming soluble complexes with metal
   ions. The above results and conclusions are supported by FT-IR analysis
   of various illite-FA-Cu2+ systems. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{A quantitative evaluation of the biodegradation rater; of mixtures of
   volatile aromatic compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes
   {[}BTEX]) was conducted. Three different mixed bacterial cultures grown
   on BTEX or benzene were used in batch biodegradation tests with
   individual and mixed BTEX compounds. The bacteria degraded each compound
   faster when it was present alone than when it was a component of a BTEX
   mixture. The biodegradation rates in the mixtures were predicted using a
   basic competitive inhibition model to account for the effects of up to
   five BTEX compounds. Under the limiting assumptions of similar
   individual half-saturation coefficients (K-s) for the multiple compounds
   and substrate concentrations significantly greater than K-s, the
   competitive inhibition model could be simplified to demonstrate that the
   biodegradation rate of any individual compound in the multi-component
   mixture should be proportional to its individual maximum specific
   degradation rate and the concentration of the compound relative to the
   total mixture concentration. Comparison of measured BTEX mixture
   degradation to predictions from this simplified model showed this model
   yielded estimates of similar accuracy to the more rigorous competitive
   inhibition equation. This is the first report of a quantitative
   evaluation of the biodegradation of five-compound mixtures. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Detailed epidemiological studies in the UK have shown a dose-response
   relationship between water quality and gastroenteritis experienced by
   bathers. Other predictors of gastroenteritis found in the studies
   provide comparative levels of risk attributable to, for example, certain
   types of food. The statistical distribution of faecal streptococci,
   based on log(10) mean and log(10) SD, is used to describe the exposure
   of the bathing population. The exposure distribution is used in
   combination with the dose-response relationship and other independent
   risk factors as a framework for a health-related ``standards{''} system.
   The standard system defines a series of water quality thresholds which
   take into account variation in water quality. These categories could
   provide a basis for both ``health-related{''} water quality objectives
   and advice to the public on potential health risks from bathing. (C)

Abstract = {{Chemical oxidation of debittering table olive wastewaters using ozone
   alone and combined with hydrogen peroxide or UV radiation has been
   studied. The effect of oxidant concentrations on GOD, BOD, TC (total
   carbon), aromatic content and colour of wastewaters has been observed.
   COD reduction of 80 or 90\% can be reached with ozone doses between 3
   and 4 g in the presence of 10(-3) M initial hydrogen peroxide
   concentration (2.4 g at the conditions investigated) or 254 nm UV
   radiation while moderate reductions of TC can be achieved (between 40
   and 60\%). Both the aromatic content and colour nearly completely
   disappear with less than 0.5 g of ozone applied. Along the reaction pH
   of wastewaters diminishes from 12 to 7.5. Biodegradability of
   wastewaters, measured as BOD/COD, increases from 0.16 (untreated
   wastewaters) to nearly 0.7 or 0.8 when using ozone combined with
   hydrogen peroxide (2.95 g O-3 fed during 2 h and 2.4 g H2O2 initially
   charged) or UV radiation (3.98 g O-3 fed during 2 h and 2.65 x 10(-6)

Abstract = {{Two methods were investigated for measuring the substrate utilization
   Monod biodegradation kinetics of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene,
   o-xylene, and p-xylene (BTEX) by mixed bacterial cultures grown under
   three different conditions. The mixed cultures were grown in completely
   mixed reactors that were batch fed every two hours with either BTEX or
   benzene and operated at a 5-day solids retention time (SRT); a BTEX-fed
   culture was also grown at a 20-day SRT. Only maximum specific substrate
   degradation rates (k) could be determined ill batch tests where BTEX
   concentrations were measured at discrete time points, since not enough
   data could be acquired at low substrate concentrations near the
   half-saturation concentration (K-s) of the compounds. Both k and K-s
   could be determined in batch tests using an indirect method where
   dissolved oxygen depletion was continuously measured. The measured
   biokinetics of each of the cultures varied over time (coefficient of
   variation of the k and K-s values of 27-44\% and 43-100\%,
   respectively), despite constant growth conditions. This biokinetic
   variability should be incorporated into design uncertainty to develop
   safety factors for reliable bioreactor performance. Results also showed
   that the opc:rating solids retention time of the reactor and the
   combination of growth substrates affected the biokinetic coefficient
   values of the individual BTEX compounds. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{A novel Electro-Fenton (EF-Fere) method, applied H2O2 and
   electrogenerated ferrous ion, was investigated for treating the
   hexamine-containing wastewater. The performance of Fe2+ generation in
   the electrolytic system was first evaluated, including the factors of
   the cathode material, initial pH, initial ferric concentration (Fe-i),
   and current density. When initial pH exceeded 2.5, the current
   efficiency dramatically decreased, which was due to the formation of
   Fe(OH)(3). Between 3000 and 10,000 mg/l of Fe-i, the initial current
   efficiency of Fe2+ generation was almost constant (85-87\%), which
   dropped sharply to 39\% at 1000 mg/l. In EF-Fere experiments, the COD
   removal efficiency attained above 94\% after 5 h of reaction. The
   relationship between the temperature, dissolved oxygen, and COD was
   discussed. The changes in hexamine and its oxidation intermediates
   (methanol, formaldahyde, formate, ammonium and nitrate) during the
   reaction were also investigated. Three additional experiments using
   H2O2/Fe2+, H2O2/Fe3+, and direct electrolysis were also conducted to
   treat the hexamine-containing wastewater for comparison. The results
   showed that the EF-Fere method was the most efficient. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Sodium bromide can be used to convert hypochlorous acid into hypobromous
   acid. An alternative strategy to biofouling control uses the
   simultaneous addition of sodium bromide and chlorine to water used for
   power plant condenser cooling. This approach can significantly reduce
   the total disinfectant and halogen application rates because the bromine
   oxidants that are generated are more effective for controlling
   biofouling than their chlorine counterparts, especially at higher pHs.
   Since such a change in biofouling control strategy could adversely
   impact the environment, the acute toxicity of bromine oxidants were
   evaluated in both continuous and intermittent exposure scenarios. Decay
   properties of bromine oxidants were compared to those of chlorine
   oxidants. In addition, two tests were conducted to investigate the
   relative toxicities of chloramines and bromamines. For the six species
   tested, bromine oxidants were two to five times more toxic than chlorine
   oxidants. For continuous exposure to bromine oxidants. LC50 values for
   daphnids (Dapnia magna) and amphipods (Hyalella azteca) could not be
   calculated because significant mortality occurred at the oxidant
   quantitation limit. Both chlorine and bromine proved to be more toxic to
   daphnids and mysids (Mysidopsis bahia) in the presence of ammonia. While
   the toxicity data show that bromine oxidants ore more tonic than
   chlorine oxidants, bromine oxidants decayed two to five times faster
   than chlorine oxidants in freshwater and saltwater, respectively. With
   regard to potential environmental impact, it is important that one
   consider the more efficacious biocidal characteristics of bromine (i.e.
   higher pHs) in the context of more rapid decay relative to chlorine. The
   strategy of using simultaneous addition of sodium bromide and chlorine
   could reduce environmental impact potential, although insufficient data
   exists to prove this. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   coliform bacteria and coliphage from raw sewage. More than a 4 log(10)
   reduction in the numbers of these microorganisms was achieved at room:

Abstract = {{In the treatment of hospital waste sludge which contains high
   concentrations of organic components, the amount of hypochlorite has a
   pseudo-first-order relationship to the formation of organic halides.
   When waste sludge was treated with 400 ppm of hypochlorite, the amount
   of TOX found in the chlorinated waste sludge was 291.6 mu g/g, (vs. 68.5
   mu g/g of TOX found in original sludge). The distributions of TOX were
   11.2 (3.8\%), 53.0 (18.2\%) and 226.9 (78.0\%)mu g/g, in the gas, liquid
   and solid phases, respectively. Ethanol is a common and safe solvent
   that is used for the extraction of organic halides from sludge. However.
   the high partitioning coefficient of sludge for microorganism hoc (or
   chlorinated microorganism hoc) retards the extraction effectiveness of
   ethanol. The lack of variation in the 1R absorption spectra of the
   residues at various molecular weights suggests that there is only a
   slight change in the functional groups during chlorination. (C) 1998

   humic substances (e.g. 1 mg/l as DOG), the Mn-catalysed ozonation is
   obviously enhanced. However, with the further increase of humic
   substance concentration, a negative effect of humic substances on the
   catalytic oxidation of atrazine is observed for both the cases of Mn(ll)
   and Mn(IV). It is proposed that Mn-catalysed ozonation of atrazine
   follows a radical-type mechanism. At low concentrations of humic
   substances, both the manganese species and the humic substances may
   initiate and promote the formation of hydroxyl radicals during ozonation
   which enhance the destruction of atrazine. However, at higher
   concentrations, humic substances may scavenge these highly reactive
   hydroxyl radicals, thus decreasing the oxidation efficiency of atrazine.

Abstract = {{A framework for modelling removal in deep-bed filtration is presented.
   This framework uses a phenomenological model as its basis, with
   well-defined parameters. The parameters were chosen to provide the best
   fit to one set of experimental data and theoretical models used to
   predict how the parameters change with operating conditions. The model
   predicts behaviour of the complete filter run, and takes account of
   variations in dow rate, temperature, grain size and particle size
   distribution. The model results were found to be reasonably consistent
   with experimental observations. The theoretical models used in this
   paper are relatively simple, but the framework is designed so that more
   sophisticated models can be used within the framework. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new electrolytic method for the synthesis of PAC
   (polyaluminum chloride). The ECR (electrochemical reactor) used aluminum

   adopted low voltage and high electric current intensity during

   the aqueous solution, affecting the formation of the most effective
   species of PAC, were also studied. The liquid product of PAC, in which
   the most effective species, Alb (The polymeric Al component estimated by
   the ferron method), was above 70\% by weight of the total aluminum with
   a basicity, B (OH/Al molar ratios) = 2.4, was successfully generated.
   The results measured by the ferron method and Al-27 NMR method showed
   that the Alb or Al-13 content of the E-PAC (PAC prepared by
   electrolysis) were obviously higher than that of the general PAC and
   other coagulants. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new analytical solution technique for networks of irreversible
   chemical reactions in batch reactors with first-order kinetics is
   presented. The solution technique involves the iterative calculation of
   a coefficient matrix that is then applied for direct calculation of
   species concentrations at any time. The derivation, which is based on
   Laplace transforms of an arbitrary network, is presented in the
   appendix. Several examples and extensions to the solution are discussed.
   Extensions made to the solution include the consideration of phase
   equilibria, first-order and zero-order sources and sinks, common
   reaction products outside the network, and combined networks of
   reactions and CSTRs. Rate-limited mass transfer effects and reversible
   reactions were not considered, The solution is general, compact, easy to
   use, and allows several extensions that will likely aid scientists and
   engineers in solving problems related to the dynamics of these networks.

Abstract = {{With system closure, mills are discharging warmer and more concentrated
   effluent which would be more economically; reused if treated
   thermophilically. The influence of high temperature biological treatment
   was studied in four parallel sequencing botch reactors over 40 weeks in
   mesophilic (35 degrees C) and thermophilic (45, 55 and 60 degrees C)
   operation. All SBRs were inoculated with mesophilic sludge obtained from
   mill scale activated sludge reactors and the temperature of the reactors
   were raised slowly to give enough time for acclimatization of the
   sludge. The COD removal percentage varied from 40-76\% with steady-state
   averages of 75 +/- 9.79\%. 73 +/- 10\%, 62 +/- 9\% and 63 +/- 10\% for
   SBRs operating at 35, 45. 55 and 60 degrees C, respectively. The COD
   removal was significantly higher at 35 and 45 degrees C in comparison
   with 55 and 60 degrees C. AOX removal (20-75\%) decreases with
   increasing temperatures, although the differences are not statistically
   significant between mesophilic and thermophilic operation. Chemical
   compound analysis of feed and various treated effluent showed a better
   removal of long chain fatty acids at thermophilic (60 degrees C)
   conditions in comparison to the mesophilic (35 degrees C) conditions.
   Smaller pinpoint flocs were observed in the 55 and 60 degrees C SBRs,
   which are responsible for an increase in suspended solids concentrations
   in the treated effluents from 20 to 50 mg/l. The sludge volume index
   (SVI) results varied from 50-150 ml/g at different temperatures with a
   minimum at 45 degrees C, thereby indicating that, in terms of settling

Abstract = {{The recognition that microorganisms satisfy their maintenance energy
   requirements in preference to producing additional biomass has revealed
   possible methods to reducing the generation of excess biomass during
   wastewater treatment. A relationship describing substrate utilization
   for maintenance and biomass production in substrate-limited continuous
   microbial cultures is presented. In continuously-fed, substrate-limited,
   microbial populations, it is proposed that the biomass production
   decreases proportionally to biomass concentration. To evaluate the
   significance of biomass concentration on biomass production, a
   laboratory chemostat containing Pseudomonas putida grown aerobically was
   fitted with a second stage in which the biomass in the reactor effluent
   was concentrated and a portion was recycled to enhance the biomass
   concentration. Overall substrate removal efficiency remained constant at
   each of the various biomass concentrations investigated. Increasing
   biomass concentration from 3 to 6 g l(-1) reduced biomass production by
   12\% and analysis of a similar system observed that increasing biomass
   concentration from 1.7 g l(-1) to 10.3 g l(-1) reduced biomass
   production by 44\%. Maintenance energy coefficients and true growth
   yields for operation both as a chemostat and with biomass recycle were
   found to be similar; q(m)=0.027 +/- 0.004 g substrate g biomass(-1)
   h(-1) and Y-G = 0.359+/-0.003 g biomassg substrate(-1) and
   q(m)=0.021+/-13.008 g substrate g biomass(-1) h(-1) and Y-G =0.385 +/-
   0.022 g biomass g substrate(-1), respectively. The relevance of these
   findings for biomass production in wastewater processes are discussed.

Abstract = {{Digestion of municipal solid organic waste (MSW). particularly of
   kitchen refuse with a total solid concentration of 7-8\% VS (volatile
   solids) was investigated. Experiments at mesophilic (37 degrees C) and
   thermophilic (55 degrees C) conditions were carried out comparatively in
   continuously stirred digesters with 30 1 volume, Increasing the organic
   loading rate (OLR) by reducing the hydraulic retention time (HRT). the
   maximum capacity of the biological process was assessed. With OLR = 6.0
   g VS l(-1) d(-1) and HRT = 11 d, the maximum VS reduction under steady
   state conditions reached 72\% at mesophilic and 80\% at thermophilic
   conditions. At 55 degrees C, the yield Y-gas, reached about 830 1 gas kg
   VS-1 whereas at mesophilic conditions only about 800 I gas kg VS-1 were
   generated. A simple mathematical model was set up to describe digestion
   performance adequately designating the process conditions for most
   effective turnover. This model was based on kinetic data of a one stage
   digester. With the assistance of the model and the data of digestion
   experiments the process conditions could be optimized. The main result
   was that the digestion of MSW should be performed in a two stage plant
   with a concentration unit between the two stages, Under these optimized
   process conditions a turnover of the organic mutter of 90\% with low
   retention time could be realized. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), one of the most commonly used
   phenoxy acid herbicides. A long acclimation period (about 4 months) was
   observed before 2,4-D biodegradation was established. At steady-state
   operation, all reactors achieved practically complete removal (>99\%) of
   2,4-D and the corresponding supplemental substrate (where applicable),
   regardless of the HRT applied, ranging from 12 to 48 h. A sequential
   utilization pattern of supplemental substrate and 2,4-D was observed
   throughout the study. The 2,4-D specific removal rates were affected by
   the type of supplemental substrate used (phenol or dextrose). being
   significantly lower (30 to 50\%) in the case of dextrose. Overall. the
   changes in the feed concentration of supplemental substrate or 2,4-D did

Abstract = {{Biodegradation kinetics for phenanthrene and fluoranthene, as a function
   of their dissolved concentrations, were determined for a marine
   PAH-degrading enrichment. Biodegradation rates in the presence of
   artificial (Celite coated with humic acid) or Puget Sound sediments with
   sorbed PAH were then determined. These rates were expected to be slower
   than for the tests without sediment, because of limited PAH in the
   soluble phase due to desorption limitations of PAH from the solid to
   liquid phases. Due to the low aqueous PAH concentrations that exist for
   PAH compounds, radiolabeled PAH compounds were used to follow the fate
   of the PAH compounds in batch degradation test. The radiolabeled
   compounds were followed as evolved CO2, unreacted PAH in the dissolved
   phase or sorbed to sediment, and as non-polar intermediate products.
   Epifluorescence microscopy was used to determine if the marine
   enrichment bacteria could attach to sediment during PAH degradation.
   Without sediment, first-order degradation rate coefficients with respect
   to PAH concentration for phenanthrene ranged from 0.033 to 0.139 L/mg-d.
   depending on when the marine enrichment was tested, Fluoranthene
   first-order degradation rate coefficients without sediment were 0.132
   and 0.162 L/mg-d. With sediment present, degradation rates for
   phenanthrene rind fluoranthene were 2.1 to 3.5 and 2.1 to 5.3 times
   faster, respectively, than the degradation rates at the same aqueous PAH
   and biomass concentrations without sediment, With phenanthrene present
   about 50\% of the biomass added to test samples was attached to the
   sediment. The results suggest that biomass interactions with sorbed PAH
   at the sediment particle surfaces account for increased PAH degradation
   rates in the presence of a solid phase material. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Active carbon fiber was used as electrodes to treat several simulated
   dyeing wastewater and factual textile-dyeing wastewater from a
   textile-dyeing operation at Shanghai. This method was found to be quite
   effective and highly competitive in contrast with Fenton's reagent.
   Several operating variables, such as voltage, pH and salt added were
   studied to ascertain their respective effect on the treatment efficacy.
   According to the experiment, nearly all the wastewater's chromaticity
   removals were higher than 90\%, with COD removals within ca. 40-80\%.

Abstract = {{In a preliminary survey of hepatitis A virus (HAV) ill local shellfish,
   HAV was found present in shellfish on two out of nine separate sampling
   occasions conducted in the winter. No HAV was ever detected in the
   shellfish-rearing marine waters on same sampling occasions. The levels
   of faecal coliforms and coliphages in both the shellfish and the
   shellfish-rearing waters did not provide any indication of the
   likelihood of the presence or absence of HAV in the shellfish.
   Subsequent one-year monthly microbiological monitoring of shellfish at
   two sites also gave similar results in that HAV was detected in
   shellfish on two sampling occasions in the autumn but levels of faecal
   coliforms and coliphages did not provide any clue to the presence or
   absence of HAV. The present study suggests that direct examination of
   HAV in shellfish may be useful for monitoring HAV in water environment.

Title = {{Tertiary lagoons: A review of removal mechanisms and performance}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Tertiary lagoons, or maturation ponds, have generally been viewed as an
   effective and low-cost method of removing pathogens from wastewater.
   Their low operation and maintenance costs have made them a popular
   choice for wastewater treatment, particularly in developing countries
   since there is little need for specialised skills to run the systems.
   This paper provides a critical review of the literature on the removal
   mechanisms operating in tertiary lagoons, and their overall performance.
   Numerous physical and chemical parameters have been suggested as factors
   involved in bacterial removal, and particular attention is paid in this
   paper to the relationship between pH,dissolved oxygen concentration and
   light. Very little information is available on the mechanisms of removal
   for intestinal parasites or viruses, or for BOD, COD or heavy metals.
   The two proposed mechanisms for nitrogen removal (ammonia volatilisation
   and sedimentation of organic nitrogen) are discussed. It has become
   obvious from the wide variations in performance reported in the
   literature that the design criteria currently in use for lagoons are not
   adequate. It is thought that by gaining a better understanding of the
   removal mechanisms operating in the lagoons, the design of new lagoons
   can be improved. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional formulas used for design of fitters and interpretation of
   experimental data depend upon a number of simplifications including
   negligible solid velocity u(s) and a superficial liquid flow rate q(L)
   which is assumed to be a function of time and independent of distance x
   through a filter cake. The extent of variation of u(s) and q(L) for
   highly compactible biosolids is discussed in this article. An
   approximate method based on well-known equations which rest on the
   assumption the q(L) is constant throughout a compressible cake at a
   given time is presented. Using previously available formulas, the
   assumption of constancy of q(L) is abandoned; and approximate equations
   yielding q(L) as a function of x are developed. Comparisons are made of
   the variation with distance of q(L), u(s), and relative velocities for
   cakes of different degrees of compactibility and slurries of varying
   concentrations, problems related to verification of a given model are
   discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The start-up of a membrane-assisted bioreactor for nitrogen removal from
   sludge reject water was examined. The aim was to rapidly achieve a high
   nitrogen loading rate while maintaining complete nitrification and to
   maximize denitrification with addition of methanol or acetic acid. The
   use of an ultrafiltration unit with a positive displacement pump for
   sludge recirculation resulted in complete nitrification at an aerobic
   sludge loading rate of 0.16 kg N (kg SS)(-1) d(-1) within two weeks. The
   use of a microfiltration unit with a centrifugal pump for sludge
   recirculation, resulted in complete nitrification at a maximal aerobic
   sludge loading rate of 0.08 kg N (kg SS)(-1) d(-1). With the centrifugal
   pump, a sudden collapse of nitrification was observed. The rapid
   decrease of the specific sludge activity was attributed to shear stress
   resulting from the high recirculation rate of biomass through the
   centrifugal pump. NH3 was found to inhibit Nitrobacter at a
   concentration higher than 0.1 mg N l(-1). Denitrification with methanol
   required an adaptation period of three weeks after which more than 80\%
   denitrification was achieved. Denitrification of nitrite with methanol
   required a COD:N ratio of 2.3 g g(-1), denitrification of nitrate
   required a COD:N ratio of 3.8 g g(-1). With acetate no adaptation was
   needed and 90\% denitrification was achieved. A low biomass growth of
   0.092 g SS (g CODremoved)(-1) or 0.398 g SS (g N-removed)(-1) was
   obtained. Polymer ultrafiltration of activated sludge at a concentration
   of 4 g SS l(-1), a transmembrane pressure (TMP) of 220 kPa and a linear
   how velocity (V) of 1.5 m s(-1) resulted ina long term flux of 81 m(-2)
   h(-1). For the ceramic microfiltration membrane, a long term flux of 160
   l m(-2) h(-1) was achieved (5.3 to 18.1 g SS l(-1), TMP = 200 kPa, V =
   3.0 m s(-1)). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen fluxes and processes were estimated in sandy and muddy
   sediments from the shallow eutrophic lake Nuldernauw, The Netherlands.
   N-2, NH4+, NOx- and CH4 fluxes were measured from sediment samples
   collected throughout the year and incubated under both oxic and anoxic
   conditions at 2, 12 and 23 degrees C. Fluxes increased with temperature
   with a mean temperature factor of 1.9 +/- 0.3 for a 10 degrees C
   increase for both sediment types. At the same temperature the total N
   fluxes (N-2 + NOx- + NH4+) from the muddy sediments were generally
   larger than those from the sandy sediments. These differences are
   related to the relatively high availability of decomposable organic
   matter in the muddy sediments compared to the sandy sediments.
   Especially the denitrification was influenced by the organic matteI
   content: 75-90\% of the total N flux was denitrified by the muddy
   sediment whereas only 45-65\% was denitrified by the sandy sediments.
   NH4+ fluxes were much higher and NOx- fluxes were much lower in cores
   collected just after spring bloom of phytoplankton, compared to cores
   collected during other periods. This effect was most pronounced at the
   high incubation temperature. The freshly settled and easily degradable
   organic matter at the top of the sediment appeared to be of great
   influence. Based on the results a general concept, combining the effects
   of temperature and (easily degradable) organic matter on N loss due to
   the coupled denitrification, was postulated. The concept implies that
   the coupled denitrification initially increases with increasing contents
   of (fresh) organic matter and/or temperature. By a further increase of
   organic matter or temperature, however, more oxygen is consumed by the
   aerobic mineralization and the CH4 oxidation and little or no oxygen
   remains available for the oxidation of nitrogen. Consequently no or less
   coupled denitrification can occur. Although high temperatures are not
   often found in the Dutch surface waters, these conditions can occur in
   spring and summer. Then nitrogen removal from the sediment-water system
   by the coupled nitrification-denitrification will be reduced and
   ammonium will be released to the overlying water where it can be
   consumed by algae. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the influence of pore water chemistry on the
   filtration and physicochemical properties of a male-specific filamentous
   bacteriophage isolated from chlorinated effluent of the San Jose Creek
   Water Reclamation Plant in Los Angeles County, California. The isolate
   belongs to a class of bacteriophage that are naturally present in
   sources of sewage, and hence may be an indicator of fecal contamination
   in groundwater. Furthermore, there is some evidence that this class of
   bacteriophage are mobilized in the subsurface following rainfall events,
   although the mechanism responsible for this process is not yet clear.
   Using a model filtration system consisting of packed columns of quartz
   sand, we found that the filtration of this isolate was strongly
   dependent on the concentration and valence of the dominant cation in the
   pore fluid. In one set of experiments involving columns 19 cm in length,
   virus retention in the column increased from 0\% to 99.999\% when the
   electrolyte composition of the pore fluid was changed from 10 mM NaCl to
   10 mM CaCl2. With one exception, filtration efficiencies calculated from
   the column experiments were inversely proportional to the
   electrophoretic mobility of the virus, implying that electrostatic
   interactions between the virus and the quartz surface dominate the
   filtration dynamics of this particular bacteriophage. From a practical
   perspective, these results indicate that small changes in the hardness
   and total dissolved solids of pore fluids - as might occur following a
   rainfall event - can dramatically affect both the filtration and
   mobilization of filamentous bacteriophage in subsurface systems. (C)

Abstract = {{Potable and monitoring wells located in close proximity to a large
   groundwater recharge project which utilizes a blend of surface water and
   reclaimed wastewater for recharge were tested for coliphage over a
   period of 6 months to assess the potential for virus migration. During
   the first 3 months FRNA phage were detected once at a shallow monitoring
   well. In late summer, an unexpected pulse of phage was detected in all
   wells, including control sites, suggesting an ecological phenomenon
   independent of recharge operations. Cubic and filamentous F-specific
   coliphage, consistent with the Levivridae and Inoviridae groups, and a
   noncontractile tailed phage consistent with the Siphoviridae family were
   detected. There was no discernible relationship between recharge
   operations and the pattern of phage populations detected. Phage were
   detected using a host designated HS12, a variant of KS(pFamp)R
   (Debartolomeis, J. and Cabelli, V. J. (1991) Evaluation of an
   Escherichia roll host strain for enumeration of f male-specific
   bacteriophages. Appl. Environ. Microbiol, 57, 1301.). During the study
   it was found that HS12 contained a temperate Myoviridae phage;
   Myoviridae phage were subsequently excluded from the results. A total of
   26 production wells, including 3 control sites, were sampled monthly and
   6 monitoring wells were sampled every two weeks: Water reclamation plant
   effluents and river water upstream of effluent discharges were randomly
   sampled. The concentration and distribution of phage isolated was quite
   different in chlorinated effluent compared to river water. The majority
   of isolates from reclaimed water were filamentous DNA F-specific phage
   suggesting this group was more resistant to chlorine. Groundwater
   samples were analyzed using a novel large volume enrichment technique
   that proved very sensitive for detecting low concentrations of phage.

Abstract = {{In this study, first, the polluted raw water of a municipal water
   treatment plant was subjected to direct chlorination or chlorination
   preceded by PAC adsorption. The results show that, with PAC, the aqueous
   phase NPDOC was found to increase with increasing chlorine dosage after
   the dosage exceeded certain value. The concentration of the halogenated
   organics in the aqueous phase of both cases was found to increase with
   increasing chlorine dosage. Furthermore, the concentration from the
   system involved PAC may be higher than that without. Those phenomena are
   supposed to be due to the release of dissolved organics into aqueous
   phase, as a result of reaction between chlorine and the adsorbed
   organics. Next, synthetic waters, each containing only one organic
   fraction extracted from the raw water, were subjected to similar
   experiments. A similar response tb chlorination as to that of raw water,
   i.e. increase in NPDOC value with increasing chlorine dosage and the
   concentration of halogenated organics from the system involved PAC can
   be higher than that without, can only be found in the system with low
   molecular weight hydrophilic neutral organics, but not the system with
   high molecular weight humic acid. It is speculated that the adsorbed low
   molecular weight organics were desorbed from carbon surface more easily,
   compared to the adsorbed high molecular weight organics. Therefore, the
   organic contents in raw water may affect its behavior during the
   adsorption-chlorination process. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   activated sludge wastewater treatment process using a distributed
   parameter approach. A computational algorithm, based on the global
   orthogonal collocation technique, for the activated sludge process is
   developed in this work. Steady-state and dynamic simulations are
   performed based on this algorithm. The system configuration considers
   backmixing or intermixing, which can represent the actual process more
   accurately than the idealised flow schemes commonly employed for the
   design and modelling of the activated sludge reactors. Based on a
   dispersed plug how model for activated sludge bioreactor formulated in
   this work, a Peclet number in the order of 0.5 to 5 and 5 to 7 internal
   collocation-points are recommended for modelling channel-type activated
   sludge bioreactor. The dynamics of substrate is predicted well whereas
   the prediction for biomass is fair, when compared to the experimental
   data. It is also demonstrated in this paper that the proposed algorithm
   can give superior prediction of process dynamics than the commonly-used
   tanks-in-series technique. Dynamic responses caused by disturbances in
   the influent wastewater which propagates at Various spatial positions
   along the bioreactor can be correctly predicted through simulations. (C)

Abstract = {{In the Atlantic Coastal Plain, riparian wetlands are thought to play an
   important role in removal of mobilized agricultural chemicals from
   groundwater. Degradation potential for dicamba
   (3,6-dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid) and metribuzin
   (4-amino-6-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-3-(methylthio)1,2,4-triazin-5 (4H)-one)
   were evaluated in riparian wetland soils of the Nomini Creek Watershed,
   VA, using serum bottle microcosms under nitrate reducing (NO3 amended)
   and non-nitrate reducing conditions. Soil samples were collected from
   two surface horizons (referred to as ponded and terrestrial, 1-15 cm)
   and the subsurface (25-45 cm) of a Bibb (coarse-loamy, siliceous, acid,
   thermic Typic Fluvaquent) sandy loam in May (soil temperature 16.4
   degrees C), September (19.9 degrees C) and November (13.5 degrees C) of
   1993 from 12 locations equidistant along a 250 m section of the riparian
   stream. Metribuzin degradation potential was determined for soils
   collected in May only. Dicamba was demethylated to 3,6-dichlorosalicylic
   acid under either nitrate reducing or non-nitrate reducing conditions,
   while metribuzin was degraded to diketometribuzin (DK), deaminated
   diketometribuzin (DADK) and deaminated metribuzin (DA). The presence of
   metabolites DA and DK was confirmed by gas chromatography coupled with
   mass spectrometry. The rates of dicamba and metribuzin degradation were
   generally more rapid in the surface than in the subsurface soil
   microcosms. In contrast to dicamba, the disappearance of metribuzin was
   slower. Although the degradation experiments were conducted in
   microcosms under Laboratory conditions, they indicate that these
   riparian wetland soils possess limited potential to degrade dicamba and
   metribuzin. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrates (NI) and total phosphorus (TP) fluxes were analysed in an
   agricultural river of southwestern France, the Save River, in order to
   identify their nonpoint and/or point-source origin. For this purpose, TP
   and NI concentrations were measured and the fluxes calculated along the
   whole river at 27 sampling sites during three different seasons; Pearson
   correlation coefficient and partial correlation were systematically
   calculated for each sampling period between TP or NI loads and the
   environmental variables; i.e. number of inhabitants, forest, crop and
   pasture surfaces. In Spring and Winter, concentrations and fluxes of NI
   and TP increased from the headwaters to the mouth of the Save River.
   During the dry season, in Summer, concentrations and fluxes of NI and TP
   were strongly influenced by instream biological processes and artificial
   water supply. During wet seasons, i.e. in Winter and Spring, in spite of
   the same spatial dynamics-of TP and NI fluxes, it appears that nitrate
   fluxes entering the river originated mainly from croplands (i.e. diffuse
   pollution) whereas phosphorus fluxes were highly related to the number
   of inhabitants (i.e. point source pollution). During the rainiest
   season, i.e. in Spring, phosphorus fluxes were also related to forests
   which are mainly located in the steep slope upstream part of the
   drainage basin. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Water hardness plays an important role in waste water treatment
   processes. Calcium and/or magnesium salts of organic products are mostly
   precipitated due to their low solubility and they are less biodegradable
   than the equivalent sodium or potassium salts; more soluble in water. In
   the case of alkaline salts of fatty acids (soaps) reported in the
   present work, we have obtained a biodegradation of 80\% average in
   anaerobic digesters, which is still significantly different from the
   expected value of 100\% assumed theoretically for sodium or potassium
   derivatives. Soap biodegradation in anaerobic digester was studied both
   in laboratory scale equipment as well as on commercial scale digester of
   sewage treatment plants (STP). In the second case the biodegradation was
   further monitored on sludge amended soils using the sludge from STP's
   monitored in first step of the study. It was found that as a consequence
   of aerobic conditions prevalent in soil layer studied the remaining soap
   further biodegrades up to nearly 100\% after 150 days. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Aerobic biodegradation of four representative commercial surfactants
   under a range of concentrations (i.e., sub- and supra-critical micelle
   concentrations, CMCs) beyond those ordinarily used in biodegradation
   studies was investigated. Of the four surfactants tested, sodium
   dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) showed no biodegradation and foam
   degradation. At a sub-CMC (500 mg/l), primary biodegradation, as
   measured by methylene blue active substances (MBAS) for an anionic
   surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and by cobalt thiocyanate
   active substances (CTAS) for a nonionic surfactant Witconol, followed
   Monod kinetics, substrate depletion being a function of both microbial
   growth and substrate concentrations. However, primary biodegradation at
   supra-CMCs (500 for Tergitol and 2500 mg/l for SDS and Witconol) and
   ultimate biodegradation (mineralization) at both suband supra-CMCs were
   best described by first-order kinetics, the degradation rate being a
   sole function of substrate concentrations. Parameters for the kinetic
   models (Ks, Y, mu(max), and k) were estimated using non-linear least
   squares methods. Increasing surfactant concentrations from sub- to
   supra-CMCs significantly decreased primary biodegradation, ultimate
   biodegradation, and foam degradation. This decrease may be attributed to
   the limited bioavailability of surfactants in the micellar phase as
   compared to the monomeric surfactants. The results are of significance
   for surfactant-based remediation, since the concentrations of
   surfactants employed in remediation are typically much higher than CMCs,
   while surfactant concentrations of primary interest in biodegradation
   work are in the neighborhood of and below 10 mg/l, which is usually
   10-100 times lower than CMCs. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Synthetic and natural allophanic compounds were used to evaluate the
   phenolic compounds and color removal capacity from a biological treated
   softwood bleached Kraft mill effluent. Kinetics studies and
   solid/solution relationship using synthetic allophanic compounds were
   studied and compared with powder activated carbon adsorption. On the
   other hand, the pH effect (4 to 9) on allophanic compounds adsorption
   was studied. The adsorption capacity of three allophanic soil profiles
   (10-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm) activated by washing the soil with H2SO4,
   0.1 M, and by calcination at 550 degrees C was also evaluated. Kinetics
   studies showed that the adsorption hall-time was 2 min in both activated
   carbon and synthetic allophanic compounds and more than 90 and 70\%
   removal occurred in the first 5 min, respectively. The adsorption of
   color and phenolic compounds increased with decreasing solid/solution
   ratio in both activated carbon and synthetic allophanic compounds. pH
   plays an important role in adsorption phenomena. Phenolic compounds and
   color removal increased with the decreasing of suspension-efffuent pH,
   obtaining the optimum at pH 5.0 with 87 and 96\% removal, respectively.
   Phenolic compounds and color removal were near 90 and 75\% when 20-40 cm
   acidified and calcinated soil profile was used, respectively. The
   organic matter content in the 10-20 cm soil profile and the low content
   of the fine colloidal fraction in the 40-60 cm profile reduced the
   removal capacity of the allophanic soil. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of hydraulic retention
   time (HRT) and mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) on trihalomethane
   (THM) precursor removal in the activated sludge process and to determine
   the effect of chemical properties of the organic components on
   trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP). A laboratory-scale reactor
   for the activated sludge process was used with synthetic domestic
   wastewater as influent. Experimental conditions, HRT and MLSS, were
   varied and the effluents were evaluated in terms of DOC and THMFP.
   Hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity and chemical functional groups were
   analyzed to determine the chemical parameters that may affect THMFP.
   Optimum removal of THMFP was achieved at HRT 24 h and at MLSS of ca.
   2500 mg l(-1). Due to the organic metabolites produced in the activated
   sludge floc, better DOC or THMFP removal was not observed at longer HRTs
   and larger MLSS. Decrease in DOC did not result in comparable removal of
   THMFP. This was attributed to two factors: the higher reactivity of the
   hydrophobic organic carbon (18.5 mu g THMFP mg(-1) C) compared to the
   hydrophilic organic carbon (6.2 mu g THMFP mg(-1) C) and the nonremoval
   of the remaining hydrophobic THM precursors in HRTs longer than 8 h. The
   activated sludge process preferentially removed the hydrophilic organic
   substances which was shown to have less potential to form THM. The
   activated sludge process effluents exhibited similar chemical
   characteristics compared with various types of treated industrial
   wastewaters determined in a previous study. The activated sludge process
   effluents contained larger amounts of the hydrophilic organic substances
   compared to the hydrophobic fractions. Larger amounts of the carboxylic
   and phenolic-OH functional groups were determined in the hydrophilic
   fractions than in the hydrophobic fractions. The equation obtained for
   THMFP prediction based on bulk parameters and specific functional groups
   of the treated industrial wastewaters was also found to be applicable on
   the activated sludge process effluents. The equation suggests that bulk
   THMFP was influenced by UV 260 and organic nitrogen of both the
   hydrophilic and the hydrophobic fractions, and phenolic-OH of the
   hydrophilic fractions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Conventionally, biologically available organic carbon is assumed to be
   the sole limiting nutrient for bacterial regrowth in drinking water
   distribution system. A new method,termed bacterial regrowth potential
   (BRP) method, was developed in The University of Tokyo to take into
   account of other possibly limiting nutrients. The BRP method is a
   bioassay, produced results within 5 days, had the capability of
   identifying the limiting nutrient in the sample using the indigenous
   inoculum, and supported the attached bacterial growth due to incubation
   of test tubes in a. rotating plate. The BRP method was applied for a
   survey of Tokyo metropolitan drinking water distribution system. The
   system was distributing around 6 x 10(6) m(3)/d through 14,616 km long
   pipes (pipes were interconnected between ten treatment plants) for
   around 11 million people. Before distribution, the water had undergone
   different treatment trains but all had chlorination as the last step.
   Mostly the trains included conventional rapid sand filtration system.
   Exceptions were that one had advanced treatment such as ozonation and
   biological granular activated carbon in between
   coagulation/sedimentation and rapid sand filtration, two had slow sand
   filtration, and two others had ground water supply. The survey covered
   the whole area with a total of 28 samples collected from different
   points at two different limes over a three month period (April-June
   `95). The results of the survey had clearly illustrated that Inorganic
   nutrients were limiting in more than half of the samples analyzed. In
   the rest of the samples biologically available organic carbon was
   limiting. With the use of phosphorus instead of inorganic nutrients, the
   limiting inorganic nutrient was confirmed to be phosphorus. Hence,
   proper analysis of the water for its actual limiting nutrient and thus
   the proper control measure is proposed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{An intermittently aerated and decanted single-reactor process was
   proposed and some key control parameters investigated for nitrogen
   removal from wastewater by simultaneous nitrification and
   denitrification (SND) via nitrite. Two types of synthetic wastewater
   with acetate as the main carbon source, and chemical oxygen demand
   (COD):nitrogen (N) ratios of approximately 5:1 and 10:1 were used. For
   both types of wastewater the average COD removal efficiency reached
   above 95\%, and under optimal conditions nitrogen removal efficiency
   also reached above 90\%. This process consisted of 72 min aeration, 48
   min settling and 24 min effluent decanting. Influent wastewater was fed
   from the bottom of the reactor: and did not require a separate mixing
   phase. In this process, nitritation (1st step of nitrification) was
   induced but nitratation (2nd step of nitrification) was effectively
   suppressed and denitrification was carried out using nitrite. Most
   important parameters for effective SND via nitrite in the proposed
   process were: (1) the increase rate and the minimum and maximum
   dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration during the aeration period, (2)
   length of one cycle, and of aeration per cycle, taking advantage of the
   lag-time of nitrite-oxidizers behind ammonia-oxidizers when adjusting
   from anoxic/anaerobic to aerobic condition, and (3) close contact
   between the mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) in the reactor and the
   influent wastewater under anoxic/anaerobic condition. During the
   aeration period, DO concentration dropped initially reaching the minimum
   value after several minutes, and then rose in 2nd-order fashion. The
   optimal maximum DO concentration (at the end of the aeration period) for
   nitrogen removal was determined to be around 2.0-2.5 mg/l in this
   proposed process. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Irgarol 1051,
   2-methylthio-4-tert-butylamino-6-cyclopropylamino-s-triazine, is a newly
   developed herbicidal additive for use in copper-based antifouling
   paints. It is intended to replace the antifouling agent tributyltin,
   which has been regulated internationally due to its severe impact on the
   aquatic ecosystem. However, there is no information in the open
   literature on the abiotic degradation of Irgarol, a fact that hinders
   the assessment of its ultimate impact on the environment. This study
   showed that mercuric chloride was capable of rapidly catalyzing the
   hydrolysis of Irgarol 1051 in distilled water and buffer solutions. The
   degradation appeared to follow the reaction of a catalyzed hydrolysis
   and was not significantly affected by the pH tested (5 to 9). All other
   5 heavy metal salts tested (AgNO3, CdCl2, CuSO4, PbCl2 and ZnCl2) had
   practically no catalytic property on Irgarol hydrolysis, implying the
   involvement of a specific activity for Hg2+ in this reaction. The
   mechanism for the catalyzed hydrolysis may be the formation of bidentate
   chelation through nitrogen: (No. 5) on the ring and the nitrogen on the
   cyclopropyl-amino side chain in Irgarol 1051 with the Hg2+ ion. The
   resulting four member chelate complex would weaken the cyclopropyl-amino
   bond considerably, thus facilitating the hydrolysis reaction.
   Ultraviolet spectroscopy of the reaction mixtures and the identification
   of Irgarol hydrolysis product M1
   (2-methylthio-4-tert-butylamino-6-amino-s-triazine) by GC-MS and LC-MS
   provided the basis for the proposed mechanism on the HgCl2-catalyzed
   hydrolysis of Irgarol 1051. M1 appeared to be more stable than the
   parent compound Irgarol 1051, thus implying its possible accumulation in
   the environment. One practical aspect of this work is that HgCl2 should
   not be used in preserving water samples in Irgarol 1051 monitoring
   programs. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{164-168}},

Abstract = {{Gel entrapped nitrifiers may be used in wastewater treatment plants as
   the main N-removal system, or as an additive to existing biofilm or
   sludge systems. In any case, gel entrapped nitrifiers may be stored for
   safety measures and added in cases of a collapse of the activity in the
   plant. Different preservation techniques; freezing, drying and
   lyophilization, were evaluated as means to optimize the conservation of
   the nitrification activity immobilized in PVA-SbQ gel beads during
   storage. Glycerol, sucrose and trehalose were added in various amounts
   as cryoprotectants. After 2-3 months of storage, the nitrifiers were
   reactivated in 450 ml CSTR using a synthetic nitrification medium with
   excess ammonium. Beads frozen without any additives or in 15\% glycerol
   maintained 60\% and 40\% of the original nitrification rate they had
   before conservation, respectively. After preservation by drying and
   lyophilization, 10\% or less of the activity was recovered. However,
   even those beads reached 100\% of the previous activity within 4-9 d of
   cultivation. In the case of drying, addition of 10 mM trehalose improved
   the initial activity significantly. When lyophilized, the presence of
   protectants up to 100 mM seemed to have a positive effect on the
   reactivation of the nitrifiers. The stress of the drying process
   apparently altered the structure of the gel beads so that they never
   fully regained the initial shape and volume, but without any significant
   loss in the obtainable maximum activity. It is concluded that for long
   time storage at a wastewater treatment plant, freezing without any
   additives should be the preferred preservation technique. For
   transportation, however, when weight and size are important economical
   factors, drying may be a better alternative. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

   decreased significantly to less than 4 logs (99.99\%). Of special
   interest was that in the presence of beef extract proteins, an apparent
   reversal of MS2 inactivation, dubbed rebound, was observed. It was
   observed that after an initial 5 to 6 log reduction in infectivity, a
   consistent and-statistically significant increase in the number of
   plaque forming units (PFU), as much as 2 logs, was measured. MS2 rebound
   occurred only when the oxidized iodine residual had been quickly
   consumed by beef extract proteins in solution. Neither virus particle
   aggregation nor water salinity were found to account for the increase in
   PFU values. Based on other investigators' suggestions that iodine
   disinfection caused changes to viral protein-coats, it was hypothesized
   that conformational changes in MS2's protein coat caused by iodine would
   result in a change in the isoelectric focusing point of whole MS2
   virions. A shift in isoelectric focusing point from an acidic pH Value
   of 3.9 to more basic values, and a dispersion of the virus band after
   exposure to high levels of iodine was observed, supporting the
   hypothesis that iodine caused changes in the charge distribution
   characteristics of the protein coat. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study examined the nonideal sorption phenomena and the effect of
   mixing conditions on sorption of five chlorophenols (CPs) onto anaerobic
   granules (AG) under dynamic conditions in continuous bioreactors. Under
   dynamic bioreactor conditions, anaerobic sorption of CPs which follow
   sorption linearity and sorption-desorption singularity, can be described
   by a dynamic model incorporating linear sorption. Nonequilibrium
   sorption caused by diffusion limitations in anaerobic reactors was found
   to be negligible, which is a result of the strong hydrodynamic
   dispersion that prevails in anaerobic reactors and the high porosity of
   AG. However, minor nonideal sorption phenomena were observed for
   3,4-dichlorophenol and pentachlorophenol, both of which showed
   sorption-desorption isotherm hysteresis. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Controlling the concentration and toxicity of propionic acid in upflow
   anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors is a challenging problem in
   biological wastewater treatment. Addition of FeSO4. 7H(2)O and FeCl3.
   6H(2)O to vinasses effluent yields a precipitate and considerably
   reduction of propionic acid in solution. This is due to the coordination
   of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) to metal ions, according to C-13 NMR
   techniques. C-13 NMR broadening of signals was carried out in vinasses
   effluent as well as in pure propionic acid (5.0 g/l) with various
   concentrations of Fe ions. The results show that Fe(II) is one of the
   micronutrients in anaerobic digestion, forms less stable complexes with
   propionic acid, and leads to a higher degree of bioassimilation of the
   dissolved organic compounds to produce biogas. This is one of the main
   reasons why FeSO4. 7H(2)O facilitates the anaerobic digestion. C-13 NMR
   signals of propionic acid and vinasses effluent with Fe(III) were
   considerably more broadened as compared to Fe(II), suggesting that
   chelation of VFAs with Fe(III) is stronger than with Fe(II) and,
   however, Fe(III) reduced to Fe(II) at anaerobic conditions. Metal
   complexes were not readily degraded by bacteria as the biodegradability
   of the metal complexes depends upon the stability and chemical nature of
   the complexes, and not on the toxicity of the metal ions towards the
   bacteria. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The combined toxicity of three common trace elements - aluminum, copper
   and manganese - on the endemic freshwater amphipod Paramelita nigroculus
   (Barnard) was studied in acidic waters. In soft ``artificial{''} water
   (distilled water to which appropriate salts had been added), after
   exposure periods of 21 d and at a concentration of 1.388 mg/L AL + 0.018
   mg/L Cu, survival was 55\% for juveniles and 60\% for adults. At a
   concentration of 1.388 mg/L Al + 0.018 mg/L Cu + 13.993 mg/L Mn survival
   was 61.5\% for juveniles and 62\% for adults. These concentrations are
   139 times the AEV for Al(0.01 mg/L), at least 10 times the AEV of
   Cu(0.0016 mg/L) and Mn (1.300 mg/L) from the official South African
   guidelines for each metal. Risk and multiple regression analyses show
   that, using juveniles in natural water, when the concentration of each
   element increases by I ppb, the risk of death increases minimally (by
   1.000086) while the addition of Al. Cu mixtures increases the risk of
   death by 2.6 times. The addition of Al + Cu + Mn increases the risk of
   death by 1.5 times, suggesting that Mn reduces the risk associated with
   the other two elements. The risk of death for an adult is 0.8 times the
   risk for a juvenile, while the risk of death for a moulting individual
   is 5.3 times greater than that of a juvenile. The risk in artificial
   water (i.e. with virtually no trace metals other than those specifically
   added) is 0.9 times that of the risk in stream water. The relationship
   between log growth and log concentration is: log(y) = a + b{*}log(x) and
   between growth and concentration is: y = cx(b) where y = growth; x =
   concentration of each element, and c = log(a) to base e. Thus growth in
   river water without Mn added is y = 469x(-0.194), while in river water
   with Mn added, y = 615x(-0.088). In ``artificial{''} water without Mn
   added, y = 434x(0.108) and with Mn added y = 226x(-0.070). (C) 1998

   culture was acclimated to denitrify the wastewater at pH 9, by step-wise
   increase in wastewater nitrate concentration from 2,700 mg/L NO3-N to
   5,400 mg/L NO3-N and finally to 8,200 mg/L NO3-N. Simultaneously,
   wastewater ionic strength was increased from 0.8 to 2.7 and to 3.0 (5,
   16, and 18\% total dissolved solids (TDSI). Although complete
   denitrification occurred, the maximum specific nitrate reduction rate
   decreased from 50 to 19 mg NO3-N/g MLSS/h as wastewater nitrate and TDS
   concentration increased. Also, accumulation of nitrite increased and the
   maximum nitrite reduction rate decreased. A similar attempt to acclimate
   activated sludge to denitrify the high-TDS, high-nitrate wastewater at

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A headwater stream in an agricultural catchment in Northern-Germany was
   intensively monitored for insecticide occurrence (lindane,
   parathion-ethyl, fenvalerate). Brief insecticide inputs following
   precipitation with subsequent surface runoff result in high
   concentrations in water and suspended matter (e.g. fenvalerate: 6.2 mu g
   l(-1) 302 mu g kg(-1)). These transient insecticide contaminations are
   typical for headwater streams with an agricultural catchment area, but
   have been rarely reported in such extent. Event controlled sampling
   methods for the determination of this runoff related contamination with
   a time resolution of up to 1 h are introduced. The temporal distribution
   of the insecticide concentration is shown on different time scales
   (years, months, hours) over a period of 4 years. The measured
   concentrations are compared with other references. Insecticide losses
   due to surface water runoff were calculated between 0.01-0.07\% of the
   applied insecticide. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Polyphosphate-accumulating bacteria in activated sludge samples from an
   anaerobic/aerobic batch-type reactor for enhanced biological phosphate
   removal (EBPR) were identified by dual staining with ribosomal
   RNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindol
   dihydrochloride (DAPI) at a polyphosphate-probing concentration. The
   staining with the oligonucleotide probes showed that there were four
   major bacterial groups in the sludge: the beta subclass of
   Proteobacteria, Grampositive bacteria with a high G + C content, the
   alpha subclass of Proteobacteria, and bacteria belonging to the
   Cytophaga-Flavobacterium cluster of the
   Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides phylum. By staining with DAPI, many
   of the Gram-positive bacteria with a high G + C content and the alpha
   subclass of Proteobacteria fluoresced bright yellow. These bacteria were
   considered to accumulate a large amount of polyphosphate. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to assess the specific impact of a
   wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent on the receiving water. A
   combination of a held survey and laboratory toxicity tests was used to
   detect a possible cause-effect relationship between the plant discharge
   and the receiving water quality. In addition to biological and chemical
   quality of the river upstream and downstream from the WWTP outfall, we
   assessed Hydropsychid life cycle as a field bio-indicator. Laboratory
   experiments were carried out using the 7-day Ceriodaphnia dubia chronic
   toxicity test. Field and laboratory studies were performed
   simultaneously almost every month from March 1995 to February 1996.
   Throughout the year, we observed a biological degradation at downstream
   site compared to upstream site based on biological indices, while we
   detected a constant chronic toxicity from C. dubia test. Field and
   laboratory indicators showed that the effect of the WWTP effluent on
   organisms was at its highest in summer. By studying both the effluent
   and the receiving water, we showed that not only the concentration of
   the effluent in the river but also its quality explain the impact of the
   WWTP effluent in summer. Thanks to field investigation, we detected the
   impact of the WWTP above the outfall, the WWTP upstream site being
   polluted by the stormwater overflow. Disturbances described were due to
   nutrient loading from the organic matter and to micropollutants
   contained in the WWTP effluent. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Two methods for the determination of sediment-water exchange of
   dissolved components (a) laboratory column experiments and (b)
   calibration of a model for vertical transport of dissolved components in
   pore water- are discussed. The three parameters of the transport model
   -the effective dispersion coefficient at the sediment-water interface,
   the attenuation constant of dispersion in the sediment and the advective
   flow rate- were highly correlated. Estimates for the dispersion
   coefficient at the sediment-water interface in the shallow Lake Veluwe,
   The Netherlands, showed a large variability, but were always one to two
   orders of magnitude larger than the molecular diffusion coefficient.
   Dispersive transport dominated advective transport at the sampled sites.
   The dispersion coefficient at the sediment-water interface in shallow
   lakes can be enhanced by several mechanisms, such as pressure gradients
   caused by wind stress. Exclusion of this turbulent dispersion, as in
   laboratory column experiments with intact sediment cores, can therefore
   result in an underestimation of the real flux. For reactive compounds
   the introduced error may be partly compensated by adjustment of the
   concentration gradient due to reaction during transport and incubation.

Abstract = {{The fate of organic pollutants in the environment depends critically on
   their reactivity, which is often dominated by interactions with
   solid-water interfaces. Since most natural systems are open, they are
   represented in the laboratory better by through-flow than by batch
   reactors. For the investigation of chemical transformation reactions in
   heterogeneous systems, a new experimental equipment has been developed.
   It consists of up to ten completely mixed flow-through reactors (MFRs)
   combined with an integrated on-line analysis for the measurement of pH,
   flow rate, and educt/product concentrations. The MFRs are designed to
   operate under steady-state conditions in order to study negative
   feedback effects due to reaction products and/or loss of active sites in
   the course of the experiments. The experimental set-up was applied
   successfully to the kinetic investigation of hydrolysis and
   reduction-oxidation reactions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The authors propose a new spectrophotometric method for the
   determination of sea water alkalinity. The method consists to neutralize
   all the basic species taken into account in the alkalinity expression by
   a weak acid (formic acid) mixed with a pH sensitive dye, the
   Bromo-Phenol Blue, which has a dissociation constant close to those of
   formic acid. The neutralization reaction leads to a final mixture having
   an absorbance at 590 nm which is a function of the original alkalinity
   of the sample. Two alternative calibrations procedures are proposed and
   alkalinities measurements on sea water from different origins are
   compared with the results obtained by the classical Gran's
   potentiometric titration. The agreement between the two methods is
   usually better than 1\%. The main advantages of the method are the
   possibility to run very small samples (1-2 mL) and its rapidity. (C)

Abstract = {{The hydrochemical study of Alto Guadalentin aquifer shows an unusually
   high bicarbonate content between 15 to 35 mmol l(-1) and P-CO2 between
   0.044 to 1.289 bars and, in accordance with electric geophysical data,
   he is in relation with horst areas. The waters have temperatures between
   19 to 32 degrees C and conductivity between 1087 and 6810 mu S cm(-1)
   (which increased in zones with high exploitation) and are fundamentally
   sulphate and chloride types. Chemical equilibrium modelling shows that
   the waters are oversaturated in quartz, calcite and dolomite and
   undersaturated in anhydrite and gypsum. O-18, H-2 and C-13 isotopes
   revealed that there is an enrichment in O-18 and mixing processes
   between meteoric waters and deep circulating waters. (C) 1998 Elsevier
