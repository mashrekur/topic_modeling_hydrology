Abstract = {{A chemical mass balance (CMB) model is developed and used to identify
   sources of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans
   (PCDFs) in three sets of sediment samples from the Housatonic River,
   Connecticut, Lake Huron, and the Baltic Sea. Various combustion sources
   and manufacturing processes, such as municipal waste incineration, coal
   and wood burning, and pentachlorophenols (PCPs), were considered
   possible sources of PCDD/Fs. Source fingerprints were taken from the
   literature. Our results indicate that air-particulates (SRM 1648),
   coal-fired power plants, municipal incinerators, and PCPs contribute
   significantly to:the measured concentrations of PCDD/Fs. The relative
   errors for chi(2) equal to the number of degrees of freedom, and the
   multiple correlation coefficient R-2, are used to determine the best
   fits of the calculated to the measured PCDD/F homolog profiles. The
   average relative errors are 50.4, 49.8, and 40.6\% (d.f. = 7, 8, 7) for
   the Housatonic River, Lake Huron, and the Baltic Sea, respectively. The
   average multiple correlation coefficients are 0.740, 0.693, and 0.842
   for the Housatonic River, Lake Huron, and the Baltic Sea, respectively.
   Coal burning was the major source of PCDD/Fs before 1955 in the U.S.,
   and 1970 in Europe, and municipal incinerators thereafter. Atmospheric
   transport may affect the PCDD/Fs profiles in the sediment.
   Biodegradation in the sediment is assumed to be negligible due to the
   long half-lives of these compounds. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Effective removal of soluble natural organic matter (NOM) from
   low-turbidity waters can be achieved by aluminium coagulation provided
   due attention is paid to micro-flee formation (coagulation) and
   macro-flee development (flocculation). This work provides guidelines and
   an explanation of how pH should be controlled to maximise soluble NOM
   removal while at the same time making full use of pH-influencing
   chemicals (acid, alum, and lime). For low-turbidity waters, essential
   flee nucleating sites can be provided by the lime that is used for pH
   and alkalinity adjustment, Provided that the lime is added in sufficient
   quantity and at a point where it retains some of its particulate nature,
   i.e. immediately after coagulant addition. Adjusting the pH downwards to
   between 4 and 5 prior to coagulant addition allows the formation of
   soluble NOM-aluminium complexes that link to each other, thereby forming
   large insoluble bridged complexes (micro-flocs), that also:act as nuclei
   for macro-flee development (flocculation). (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the potential of a biological activity control
   system (BAGS) for biological activated carbon (BAG) in comparison to
   granular activated carbon (GAG) for the treatment of potable water. The
   overall objective of the project is to produce drinking water of a
   higher quality more economically;by developing a BAGS for exhausted GAC
   that can be transformed to BAC by the development of a natural biofilm
   during the bio-regeneration mode. The research therefore may be
   interesting for water companies and the activated carbon industry.
   Findings show that the lifetime of a GAC filter can be significantly
   extended by maintaining an active biofilm that has to be controlled in
   order to avoid filter clogging. The most important parameters are
   dissolved oxygen (DO), pH and a correct balance of nutrients, which
   enables a natural control of the biomass. pH control was required to
   maintain an optimal bacteria-protozoa level. Excessive growth of
   filamentous bacteria can be prevented by a decrease in DO, increase in
   pH and the reduction of one essential nutrient, e.g. total phosphorus
   (P). Total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand (GOD) values
   were reduced by bioactivity. DO, turbidity and suspended solids (SS)
   values were kept in acceptable ranges with respect to drinking water
   objectives. Plants without a significant population of protozoa deliver
   turbid low quality effluent high on SS and biochemical oxygen demand
   (BOD). It was possible to control the biofilm on GAC containing a
   natural biofilm and BAC during the bio-regeneration mode. Natural and
   artificial bio-regeneration lead to similar performance characteristics.

Pages = {{2969-2972}},

Abstract = {{A two-phase, thermophilic anaerobic reactor was operated with a
   starch-based feed. Copper, zinc, nickel and lead (3 mM) were
   individually added to the feed each for a period of 30 h. The results
   were analysed to determine the extent of metal binding in the
   acidogenic, first-stage reactor and the degree of protection that this'
   afforded to the traditionally more sensitive methanogenic phase. The
   results showed that zinc and nickel were not bound particularly well,
   that lead was bound very strongly and that copper had binding
   characteristics that were between these two extremes. When these
   findings were compared with an earlier study with a mesophilic sludge,
   zinc was shown to have a very different behaviour. A possible reason for
   this is given. An examination of the gas production by the methanogenic
   stage, in relation to the amount of metal reaching this stage, suggested
   that the phase separation did not offer any real protection from the
   toxic effects of heavy metals. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A biological wastewater treatment unit under the influence of pressure
   was operated at pressures of up to 6 bar. It was demonstrated the
   capability of operating effectively with high carbonaceous oxidation and
   nitrification efficiencies at loadings of up to 13 g BOD m(-2) day.
   Another advantage of the pressurized treatment unit was observed to be
   its low sludge production. The cost of the pressurized treatment unit
   has, however, become an important factor for the applicability of the
   pressurized treatment unit. An investigation was carried out to
   determine the approximate cost of a proposed full-scale pressurized
   unit. The comparison between the pressurized unit and the established
   treatment processes were made for three populations of 500, 1000 and
   3000 persons. The costs were then compared with those of various other
   conventional biological treatment processes capable of treating an
   equivalent wastewater load. The conventional processes selected for
   comparison were the activated sludge, biological filtration and
   conventional RBC.
   The sludge disposal cost for the pressurized unit was appreciably lower
   than that for the other processes. The results indicated that the cost
   of the pressurized unit (present value for a 20-yr period) and the costs
   of the activated sludge and conventional RBC processes were found to be
   similar for the smaller populations. However, a substantial saving could
   be obtained with the pressurized unit for the larger populations. In
   addition, there was an indication that the land requirement of the
   pressurized treatment unit decreased appreciably as the flow rate
   increased. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{To obtain fractions enriched with biodegradable dissolved organic carbon
   (BDOC) or with organic compounds responsible for the chlorine demand
   (CID) and for trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP), Seine river
   water samples were percolated on various macroporous resins (anionic,
   cationic and non-ionic) and compared with granulated activated carbon
   (GAG). In addition, measurement of UV absorbance at 254 nm and the
   fluorescence index (lambda(excitation) 320 nm) had allowed to follow up
   the retention of dissolved organic matter by the different adsorbants.
   In contrast to cationic and non-ionic resins, anionic resins confirm
   their excellent retention capacity of organic compounds responsible for
   UV 254 absorbance and fluorescence index. The relative values of
   BDOC/DOC ratio (mg-C/mg-C) are slightly increased in the effluents of
   anionic resins, indicating that they retain a little preferentially the
   refractory fraction instead of the biodegradable fraction. There is no
   significant difference between the ratio of CID/DOC (mg-Cl-2/mg-C) in
   influent and effluent of anionic resins. Cationic resin has a low
   capacity for retention of DOG, but they seem to retain significantly the
   organic compounds responsible for ClD. The capability of anionic resins
   to retain THMFP is similar to that of GAG. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Title = {{The effect of nitrate on VOC removal in trickle-bed biofilters}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{In response to the growing concern over volatile organic compounds
   (VOCs), biofiltration is becoming an established economical air
   pollution control technology for removing VOCs from waste air streams.
   Current research efforts are concentrating on improving control over key
   parameters that affect the performance of gas phase biofilters. This
   study utilized diethyl ether as a substrate, nitrate as the sole
   nutrient nitrogen source within two co-currently operated trickle-bed
   biofilters, for over 200 days. The two pelletized medium biofilters Were
   operated at a low empty bed contact time of 25 s, inlet gas flow rates
   of 8.64 m(3)/day, nutrient liquid flow rates of 1 liter/day, and COD
   loading rates of 1.8 and 3.6 kg/m(3) per day, respectively. Operational
   parameters including contaminant concentration in the gas phase,
   nutrient nitrate concentration in the aqueous phase, and the frequency
   of biomass removal were considered. Special attention was given to the
   effect and the role of nitrate on VOC removal. Throughout the
   experiment, nitrate persisted in the liquid effluent and the ether
   removal efficiencies improved with increasing influent nitrate
   concentration, which suggest that the nitrate diffusion into the
   biofilms is rate determining. By increasing the concentration of oxygen
   in the feed to this biofilter from 21\% (ambient air) to 50 and 100\%,
   while maintaining an influent ether concentration of 133 ppmv and a feed
   nitrate concentration of 67 mg-N/liter, the performance of the biofilter
   was not significantly affected. These results suggest that nitrogen was
   rate limiting as a growth nutrient rather than as an electron acceptor
   for the respiration of ether. The results also indicated that removal of
   excess biomass is necessary to maintain long-term performance. However,
   the required frequency of biomass removal depends on operating
   parameters such as loading. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A panel of bacteria, each genetically engineered to respond by increased
   luminescence to a different type of environmental stress, is presented.
   Members of the panel were shown to be sensitive to several groups of
   chemicals including phenols, halomethanes and several oxidants. The
   increase in light emission depended upon toxicant concentration and
   could, thus, be used to calculate a characteristic value, EC200,
   designating the sample concentration causing a two-fold luminescence
   induction. In almost all cases, EC200 values were lower than the
   corresponding Microtox(TM) EC50 values, indicating a generally higher
   sensitivity. One of the panel members, DPD2794, a designated DNA-damage
   sensor, responded within 2 h to the presence of genotoxicants, including
   metabolically activated nitropropane. It is suggested that these or
   similarly constructed strains can be used for the rapid and sensitive
   detection of potentially toxic and genotoxic pollutants and that the
   concept of genetically engineering a panel of microbial toxicity sensors
   can readily be implemented for environmental monitoring. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Surface sediments of the Guanabara Bay (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) were
   analyzed by a sequential extraction procedure for Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, Mn
   and Fe, determining their distribution among five geochemical phases and
   in the nitric acid extractable phase. Bioavailable phases and
   non-bioavailable phases have been determined in six transects in the bay
   to define the significant level of pollution due to sediment metal
   contamination. A multiple correlation showed limited responsibility of
   Mn and Fe oxides and humic acids in the adsorption process, which
   allowed discrimination among the different processes and suggested the
   strong influence of the hydrogen sulfide present in the highly reduced
   bay bottom environment. The authors suggest the need to avoid disturbing
   bottom sediment by dredging or by artificial bottom aeration which could
   result in a rapid worsening of the environment due to the accelerated

Abstract = {{The large wastewater treatment plants in Switzerland have to be extended
   by enhanced nitrogen removal to comply with the relevant EU directives.
   Denitrification in tertiary filtration is a cost-effective alternative
   to extended denitrification in an activated sludge system which needs
   additional reactor volume. Full-scale experiments in denitrification
   with methanol in tertiary filtration were performed at the wastewater
   treatment plant in Zurich-Werdholzli during a summer and a winter
   campaign, each lasting 4 months. One of the original 22-filter cells was
   equipped with a methanol dosage unit for this purpose. Denitrification
   rates of about 1.0 kg-N m(-3) d(-1) are attained at temperatures of
   12-15 degrees C. The denitrification is reduced significantly after main
   back-washing. Frequent back-washings (several times per day) lead to
   methanol breakthroughs due to biofilm loss. The yield coefficient Y-COD
   was 0.4 kg-CODX kg-CODme-1. In spite of the methanol dosage, the quality
   of the filter effluent is very good during normal operation in the
   winter campaign. Accumulation of the nitrite intermediate product was
   observed in summer at temperatures of 20-22 degrees C. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The adsorption and desorption kinetics of 2-nitrophenol (2NP) from

   have been studied at pHs 1, 4.6 and 13, using batch tests. Adsorption
   and desorption kinetics of 2NP on to both carbons were adequately
   described by the homogeneous solid surface diffusion model (HSSD). The
   adsorption and desorption kinetics can be predicted at different pHs by
   using adsorption kinetics parameters of the pH 4.6 and the isotherm
   parameters for the corresponding pH. Thus, the differences in the rates

Abstract = {{Soils located near high traffic roadways, particularly where renovations
   have taken place, typically exhibit elevated levels of trace metals in
   the upper soil horizon. Regulators are currently seeking an efficient
   method of site characterization and treatment system design which will
   lend itself to timely and environmentally efficacious clean-up. The soil
   investigated in this study was a silty sand collected near a bridge
   abutment for a major interstate highway. The soil had a total lead
   content of 1392 mg/kg. In addition, the soil contained a considerable
   fraction of organic carbon (approximately 6.3\%). A sequential chemical
   extraction indicated that a fraction of contaminants were in labile soil
   phases and thus amenable to chemical extraction (soil-washing). A soil
   washing design methodology is presented based on surface chemistry and
   equilibrium stage operation. In this work, a double layer surface
   complexation model was used to describe equilibrium sorption behavior
   and a preliminary design of an ex-situ counter-current equilibrium stage
   extraction process is presented. Model calibration was conducted using
   sorption data obtained from a 1:40 solid to liquid ratio (s/l),
   adsorption edge. Model validation was accomplished with batch titration
   data and a 1:20 s/l, adsorption edge. The model accurately predicted
   leachable lead concentrations over a wide pH range. The required number
   of ideal equilibrium stages was highly sensitive to pH. (C) 1997

   be used in touristic-coastal areas. Results show that removal
   efficiencies are similar in both seasons because temperature balances
   the excess of the summer load. However, the overall yield coefficient
   for sludge production is reduced around, compared with reported values

Abstract = {{Implementation of crossflow microfiltration in the held of wastewater
   treatment was investigated. The membrane used throughout the research
   was made of multifilament polyester yam woven in the form of a double
   interleave cloth with a pore size of 20-40 mu m. Secondary effluent and
   primary settled sewage, from Blyth Sewage Treatment Plant, were used in
   the investigation. The study showed that the permeation rate (flux) was
   linearly affected by the crossflow velocity (CFV) in the case of
   treating secondary effluent. Permeate quality was also found to be
   affected by the crossflow velocity values. In addition, the effect of
   feed suspended solids concentration was found to proceed according to
   the concentration-polarization phenomena. Using the crossflow
   microfiltration process in treating primary settled sewage, without
   pretreatment, was found to be impractical due to the low flux values.

Abstract = {{Based on their displacement by protons, the following ascending order of
   light metals affinity toward Sargassum fluitans biomass was observed:
   Na+ less than or equal to K+ < Mg2+ < Ca2+ < Al3+. Higher biomass-metal
   affinities resulted in lowering the leaching tendency of
   (polysaccharidic) biomass components during the sorption process. More
   than 12\% weight loss of protonated biomass occurred during 2 min of
   sorption, which should be considered in all stoichiometric and sorption
   calculations. The rate of proton uptake for Na-loaded and Ca-loaded S.
   fluitans biomass at pH 4.5 was lower than the rate of desorption at pH
   1.1. In the case of Na-loaded S. fluitans, the predominant proton uptake
   rate was of a zero order. Na uptake by protonated S. fluitans biomass
   did not take place at all in the presence of Ca and Al ions. However, it
   increased in the absence of other light metals. Since the affinity of
   Ca2+ for the biomass was much greater than that of Na+, the
   three-component system of Na+, H+ and Ca2+ could be simplified into
   proton-calcium ion exchange. The initial rate of Ca uptake with
   protonated S, fluitans biomass at pH 4.5 was lower than that of proton
   release from biomass. Approximately 20\% of Ca2+ sorbed was bound to the
   binding site as a mono-valent ion. Titration and stoichiometric
   indications pointed to the fact that Al was being sorbed as a hydroxyl
   complex. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Duplicate groundwater samples were collected from 104 monitoring wells
   (piezometers) from shallow aquifers underneath an industrial city in the
   Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Concentrations of Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr,
   Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Ti, V, Zn, Ca, Mg, K, Na, Cl, SO4, alkalinity,
   salinity, total dissolved salts, and pH were determined in these
   samples. Analysis of variance showed significantly (p < 0.05) wide
   variations in the concentrations of the above parameters. The contour
   maps of metal concentrations indicated that these variations were
   related to important landmarks in the study area. The results of
   correlation analyses suggest that geographical as well as chemical
   factors may influence metal distribution in the groundwater samples. To
   investigate the geographical effects, the analytical data were
   normalized (element/Cl ratios were calculated) for chemical variability.
   As expected, contour mapping of the ratio data of element/Cl of Na, Ca,
   Mg, K, SO4, alkalinity, salinity, total dissolved salts, and Sr vary in
   a relatively small range and did not show-a particular geographical
   trend. The groundwater sample from the industrial-dust area contained
   higher ratios between concentrations df Cl and Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo,
   Ni, Pb, and Zn. These observations clearly suggest an extraneous
   contamination source, probably industrial dust, in the area. Another
   geographical area where metal (As, Cd, Cu, Mo, Ni, Ti, and V)/Cl ratios
   were found to be large was in the vicinity of an oil-refinery.
   Groundwater samples collected from the vicinity of a fertilizer plant
   and green-belt area contained relatively higher ratios of Al, Cd, Cr,
   Co, and Ni. The results of this study suggest that leachate from the
   industrial dust, leakage from the oil refinery and fertilizer plant, and
   drainage of irrigation water are some of the important pollution sources
   in the industrial city. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The use of ozone as a pre-oxidant or intermediate oxidant in
   drinking-water treatment is becoming increasingly common. The ozonation
   of natural source waters containing natural organic matter produces
   biodegradable by-products such as organic acids, aldehydes, and
   ketoacids. These organic by-products serve as carbon source for
   bacteria, potentially causing regrowth problems in distribution systems.
   The measurement of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC)
   provides quantitative insight into the amount of BDOC that is present.
   In drinking-water treatment, removal of BDOC can also reduce the
   formation potential of chlorination disinfection by-products such as
   trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids. Removal of BDOC was optimal at an
   applied ozone:DOC ratio of 2:1 (mg/mg) for source waters containing DOC
   levels ranging from 3 to 6 mg/liter. The use of biotreatment resulted in
   a 40-50\% decrease in DOG, a 90-100\% reduction in aldehydes. and a
   40-60\% reduction in trihalomethane formation potential. No removal of
   bromate ion and dibromoacetic acid was observed. A positive correlation
   was obtained between BDOC and assimilable organic carbon; both
   parameters indicate a tendency to plateau at an applied ozone/DOC weight
   ratio of 2:1. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   been found to occur, and metabolites of alachlor may be formed and could
   accumulate. The objectives of this study were to determine the rate of
   alachlor biotransformation and to identify the transformation
   intermediates formed under aqueous denitrifying, methanogenic, and
   sulfate-reducing conditions. Second-order biotrasnformation coefficients
   for alachlor were determined to be 7.6x10(-5) (+/-4.0x10(-5)),
   2.9x10(-3) (+/-1.6x10(-3)), and 1.5 x 10(-2) (+/-1.4 x 10(-2)) 1 mg
   VSS(-1) day(-1) under denitrifying, methanogenic, and sulfate-reducing
   conditions, respectively. Acetyl alachlor and diethyl aniline were
   positively identified as transformation products of alachlor under all
   conditions. In denitrifying reactors aniline was identified as a product
   of alachlor. When acetyl alachlor was fed as the parent compound,
   aniline was also identified as a transformation product under
   methanogenic conditions. This research showed that although alachlor is
   degraded under denitrifying, methanogenic, and sulfate-reducing
   conditions, significant concentrations of several metabolites are formed
   and are only slowly degraded. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Wet oxidation of phenol by air or oxygen over a Pt/TiO2 catalyst is
   studied in a batch reactor in the temperature range 150-200 degrees C,
   pressure range 34-82 atm, and a catalyst loading range of 0-4 g catalyst
   L-1. The catalyst was powdered 4.45\% Pt/TiO2 with a maximum particle
   size of 105 mu m. Results show complete oxidation of phenol and almost
   complete total organic carbon (TOC) removal. Small amounts of stable
   organic acids are formed in side reactions of the phenol degradation
   pathway and are not readily degraded. Experimental results show that the
   reaction rate decreases by increased oxygen concentration. Theoretical
   rate expressions are derived, based on postulated oxidation and TOC

Abstract = {{We examined three samples of lysates from cell cultures that had
   previously been infected by the aerosol generated by a waste water
   treatment plant near Pisa. We first attempted to confirm that we were
   dealing with one of the enterovirus family, using an inverse PCR
   analysis of the RNA extracted from the cell lysates. This identified a
   single genome sequences in all the samples, which corresponded to
   poliovirus 3. Sequence analyses revealed that the genotyping of
   poliovirus 3 was accurate for the species, irrespective of the genomic
   region sequenced. Subspecies genotyping is only possible for the
   translated region, and in this case, it identified the Poliovirus type 3
   Leon 12a1b strain as ancestor of the virus isolated. Molecular analyses
   were then carried out on the wild virus in the regions VP2 (9623 bp),
   VP3 (922 bp) and VP1 (1128 bp) and found various nucleotide mutations
   (e.g. 472(T-->C); 970(G-->C,Cys-->Ser); 1319(G-->T,Val-->Leu);
   1743(T-->C,Val-->Ala); 1817(C-->T,Hys-->Tyr)) Thermosensitivity tests at
   34 degrees C and 44 degrees C showed a slight reversion to the heat
   resistant phenotype. The need for adequate protective measures for plant
   staff, together with the frequent use of treated water for irrigation,
   means that effective methods of aerosol borne pathogen detection and
   risk determination must be adopted. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts was
   determined both in the raw water and the treated waters from two water
   treatment plants in Selangor, Malaysia between July 1994 and January
   1995. At each treatment plant, raw and treated water samples were
   collected fortnightly on 10 separate occasions. Physical parameters,
   including dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, conductivity, turbidity and
   free and total chlorine were measured, and samples were also taken for
   faecal coliform analyses. The isolation and enumeration of cysts and
   oocysts was according to UK standard methods. Whilst Giardia cysts were
   detected in 90\% of the raw water samples (range 0-60 cysts per litre)
   no Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected. Higher concentrations of cysts
   were detected in the raw water of the first treatment plant. All raw
   water samples were faecally contaminated, as faecal coliform counts
   ranged from 4.6 x 10(4) to 1.3 x 10(5) colony forming units per 100 mi.
   No correlation between the concentration of Giardia cysts and the
   concentration of faecal coliforms could be demonstrated statistically,
   nor was there any correlation between the concentration of Giardia cysts
   and the physical parameters tested for any of the raw waters. No cysts,
   oocysts or faecal coliforms were detected in samples of treated water.

Abstract = {{This paper presents some new results about the kinetics of
   orthophosphate release and substrate uptake occurring under anaerobic
   conditions in a lab-scale activated sludge plant consisting of an
   anaerobic first and an aerobic second step (A/O-process). The synthetic
   wastewater contained acetate, peptone and yeast extract. The mixed
   culture was enriched from activated sludge samples from a large-scale
   plant with enhanced biological phosphorus removal. Anaerobic batch
   experiments were carried out with this enriched mixed culture using
   acetate as the only source for carbon and energy. In the first
   experiments, high acetate concentration was only partly consumed by the
   bacterial culture, resulting in a nearly total emptying of the
   poly-P-store (poly-P-limitation). In the next experiments, only a
   relatively low acetate concentration was added, resulting in a total
   acetate uptake and in partial emptying of the poly-P-store
   (acetate-limitation). This experimental strategy was successful in
   studying the complex kinetics of the anaerobic process in enhanced
   phosphorus removal. Most of the calculated kinetic coefficients depend
   on temperature; a dependence on pH cannot be postulated with certainty.
   A comparison with known results shows conformity but also differences.

Abstract = {{Computer modeling can be a useful tool in understanding the dynamics of
   bacterial population growth. Yet, the variability and complexity of
   biological systems pose unique challenges in model building and
   adjustment. Recent tools from Bayesian statistical inference can be
   brought together to solve these problems. As an example, the authors
   modeled the development of biofilm in an industrial pilot drinking-water
   network. The relationship between chlorine disinfectant, organic carbon,
   and bacteria concentrations was described by differential equations.
   Using a Bayesian approach, they derived statistical distributions for
   the model parameters, on the basis of experimental data. The model was
   found to adequately fit both prior biological information and the data,
   particularly at chlorine concentrations between 0.1 and 2 mg/liter.
   Bacteria were found to have different characteristics in the different
   parts of the network. The model was used to analyze the effects of
   various scenarios of water quality at the inlet of the network. The
   biofilm appears to be very resistant to chlorine and confers a large
   inertia to the system. Free bacteria are efficiently inactivated by
   chlorine, particularly at low concentrations of dissolved organic
   carbon. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a real-time process control scheme to cope with the
   problem of input disturbances in wastewater treatment processes, based
   on a fuzzy inferential control system. This can detect the presence of a
   dangerous input conditions whenever either organic overload or
   inhibitory/toxic compounds are present in the raw wastewater. Based on
   this diagnosis, a set of fuzzy rules are implemented to divert the
   process flow and bring the system back into a safe state. The control
   system was designed and tested using a pilot plant, to which a toxic
   disturbance was applied. Its behaviour with and without fuzzy control
   are compared, and the process reliability improvement in the controlled
   case is demonstrated. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from bottled and

   susceptibility, plasmid content, analysis of chromosomal DNA EcoRI

   methods showed poor discrimination power between strains, and plasmids
   were detected in 29\% of isolates. Southern blot hybridisation analysis
   showed genetic diversity between isolates, and six different ribotypes
   were defined. Arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR)
   analysis also differentiated between the strains with higher
   discriminatory power than ribotyping, since 13 different profiles were
   obtained. Both DNA-based methods are valuable alternatives to
   traditional typing systems for P. aeruginosa, and AP-PCR could be
   particularly useful for epidemiological studies. (C) 1997 Elsevier

   the narrowest littoral zone. The present pollution has ecological
   implications primarily on the enchanted point-source spots. Comparison
   of the results for these closed seas reveals that the Adriatic sea has

Abstract = {{The use of sulphorhodamine B, a known red fluorescent dye as a
   quantitative tracer in hydrological studies related to wastewaters has
   been proved experimentally. The interference in the accuracy of
   fluorescence readings owing to dissolved or suspended contaminants in
   wastewaters, especially at low concentrations of dye, was solved by
   successive filtering and eluting of the sample through a sep-pack C-18.
   The sulphorhodamine B, which is concentrated by displacement with small
   volumes of methanol, was thus retained. Volumes were then read with an
   fluorescence spectrophotometer. The procedure was demonstrated to be
   valid for use with sewers, stabilization ponds and wastewaters for
   concentrations as low as 5 x 10(-7) g litre(-1). (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Shell valve movements of fouling mussel, Mytilopsis leucophaeta, have
   been studied in the presence of chlorine, using a mussel monitor. Data
   showed increasing shell valve closure with increasing chlorine
   concentration. Shell opening rates of M. leucophaeta at control
   experiments (0 mg litre(-1) residual chlorine) were about 10 times more
   than those at 1 mg litre(-1) residual chlorine. Continuous dosing of
   0.75 mg litre(-1) residual chlorine is required before shell movements
   are critically affected. Since current environmental stipulations do not
   permit this, a level of 0.5 mg litre(-1) has to be used continuously
   during settlement periods of M. leucophaeta for their control. The
   results also indicate that M. leucophaeta is more tolerant to chlorine
   than other mussel species. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In a laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) granules were
   cultured under aerobic conditions. To enhance the growth of granular
   sludge the SBR was operated with very short sedimentation and draw
   phases resulting in the washout of slow settling biomass. Fast settling
   granules were retained in the reactor and thus had an advantage over
   flocs with a slower settling velocity. After 40 days of operation
   granules were the dominant form of microbial aggregates in the reactor,
   even though some pin-point flocs remained in the system. Granules taken
   from the reactor were stored for weeks without disintegrating. After
   about 130 days of operation the granule quality and GOD-removal
   worsened. The reasons for that are yet to be investigated. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Benzothiazoles appear in the environment mainly as a result of their
   production and use as rubber vulcanization accelerators. This review
   focuses on the potential environmental hazard these substances pose and
   their biological removal from and transformation in aquatic and
   terrestrial ecosystems. Benzothiazole degradation by mixed and pure
   cultures and the toxic impact on microorganisms are discussed. It is
   concluded that biological purification of wastewaters from
   2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) production can be achieved, provided the
   MBT influent concentration is 100 mg/l at maximum. So far, no attempts
   have been made to study the molecular mechanisms of benzothiazole
   degradation, mainly due to the unavailability of axenic cultures capable
   of benzothiazole breakdown. However, the toxic effects of MBT towards
   microorganisms have been studied and can be attributed to its metal
   chelating properties and/or its interference with membrane-bound
   (co)enzymes in particular. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The pollutant fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus were elucidated for 3
   years in a paddy-field watershed where a circular irrigation system was
   implemented. The annual net outflow loads of pollutants, i.e. the
   outflow load minus the inflow load, were as follows: the total nitrogen
   loads for the first, second and third year were -5.46, +58.7 and -4.20
   kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, and the total phosphorus loads were
   -2.87, +1.13 and -1.70 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The positive net
   outflow loads for the second year were strongly affected by a
   considerably large amount of precipitation. It is concluded that the
   study watershed purified nitrogen and phosphorus compounds during normal
   hydrological years. The reason for the good purification performance in
   spite of no significant concentration decrease was that a large amount
   of water, usually more than 1000 mm excepting precipitation, flowed
   within the watershed by paddy-field irrigation. The study watershed
   seemed to have the desirable function of pollutant removal, with the
   deposition being more effective than the flushing in the river, and the
   retention time being sufficient for the purification mechanisms in paddy
   fields. Although the circular irrigation system was originally designed
   not for the purpose of pollutant removal but to supply water for
   paddy-field irrigation, it can contribute to reducing non-point
   pollutants. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon and phosphorus transformations in a full-scale enhanced
   biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) process was followed during 1 year.
   A correlation between the soluble phosphorus uptake in the process and
   the potential substrate for bio-P bacteria, measured as the volatile
   fatty acid (VFA) potential, in the influent wastewater was found. The
   results indicated that approximately 20 mg VFA-COD were required to
   remove 1 mg of soluble phosphorus. In the anaerobic stage of the
   process, poly-beta-hydroxyalcanoic acids (PHA) were produced in an
   amount of 1.5 mg PHA-COD per mg of VFA-COD taken up by bio-P bacteria.
   Furthermore, a release of 0.31 mg of phosphate-P per mg of PHA-COD
   formed was observed in the anaerobic stage. Most of the released
   phosphate could be accounted for by a decrease in the polyphosphate
   content of the biomass in the anaerobic stage. Most of the results
   obtained were very well in agreement with the biochemical model for EBPR
   suggested by Smolders et al. (1994a). (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Several additives, polyethylene glycol, gelatin and some

   stoichiometry and minimum additive requirements were investigated. The
   fate of additive after reaction was also studied. The experimental
   results showed that all tested additives significantly reduced the
   horseradish-peroxidase requirement. Comparison among them revealed that
   polyethylene glycol was the best choice from all perspectives. It saved
   more peroxidase and had no negative overdose effect shown by gelatin and
   polyelectrolytes. At minimum polyethylene glycol dose, there was little
   polyethylene glycol remaining in solution after completion of reaction.
   However, a considerable amount of gelatin remained in solution even at
   the minimum gelatin dose. Also, gelatin produced more precipitate than
   polyethylene glycol. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A portion of administered pharmaceuticals are excreted unmetabolised by
   patients and can be found in hospital effluent and municipal sewage.
   Some pharmaceuticals such as anti-tumour agents are carcinogenic,
   mutagenic, teratogenic and fetotoxic. Little is known about their
   environmental impact. Therefore, the biodegradability of the widely used
   anti-tumour agent ifosfamide (IF) was assessed with the modified
   Zahn-Wellens test (OECD 302 B) and a test simulating biological sewage
   treatment. The biodegradation was monitored by DOC and GC/MS. The
   concentration of IF in hospital effluent, communal sewage and the
   effluent from a communal sewage treatment plant (STP) was analysed as
   well as calculated by the amounts of water and IF used in hospitals. The
   expected concentration of IF in German surface waters was calculated. IF
   was not biodegradable in the Zahn-Wellens test and the STP simulation
   test. It was not adsorbed by the sewage sludge. The concentrations
   measured in the hospital effluents, the STP influent and the STP
   effluent were of the same order of magnitude as the calculated ones,
   indicating that no adsorption, biodegradation or other elimination of IF
   took place to any noticeable extent. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Within a pilot project, a monitoring network for the description of the
   non-point sources of groundwater pollution in urban areas was
   implemented and operated for 3 years. The main concept of the network
   lay in the collection of consistent series of time data for the
   description of groundwater quality and the description of the
   relationship between the non-point sources of anthropogenic pollutants
   in the urban areas and the measured concentration in groundwater. The
   impairment of the groundwater quality due to non-point sources of
   pollution could be demonstrated and described. Supporting information on
   hydrology, geology and land-use has been used in addition to the
   measured data. The results show the significant impact of the urban
   non-point sources on the groundwater quality. In particular, drastically
   decreasing concentrations of oxygen and increasing concentrations for
   boron, EDTA and NTA have been observed. The second step of the work
   focuses on the deduction of rules for the qualification of the influence
   of land-use on the groundwater quality by means of the decision-tree
   method. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Enhanced biological phosphorus removal is based on the selective
   enrichment of bacteria accumulating inorganic polyphosphate, obtained at
   a cyclic regime of alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions. In the
   University of Cape Town (UCT) process for combined nitrogen and
   phosphorus removal, polyphosphate-accumulating bacteria will also be
   exposed to nitrate in the anoxic zone, i.e. an electron acceptor that
   may be utilized as well as the oxygen of the aerobic zone. During a
   1-year study of the full-scale UCT process run at Oresundsverket,
   Helsingborg, special attempts were made to quantify the relative
   contribution of an anoxic phosphate uptake at full-scale conditions: the
   dominant chemical oxygen demand (COD) uptake in the anaerobic zone could
   be identified as poly-beta-hydroxy-alkanoates (PHA). PHA accumulation
   was at its largest during a test period with acetate added as an extra
   carbon source. At least one-third of the COD consumed in the anoxic zone
   could be identified as PHA. The anoxic sludge contained increased
   amounts of polyphosphate and reduced amounts of free orthophosphate
   compared to the anaerobic zone, approaching the levels of aerobic
   sludge. The metal bound orthophosphate remained largely unaffected, at a
   level of 25-30\% of the total phosphorus content. After correction for
   the sludge recycling of the system, the formation of inorganic
   polyphosphate in the anoxic zone itself was estimated to be 30\% of the
   total. When the metabolic activity was tested under controlled
   conditions in batch, the anaerobic sludge of the plant showed a high
   denitrifying activity accompanied by a phosphorus uptake and a
   simultaneous consumption of intracellular PHA corresponding to 2
   g-COD/g-N, i.e. half the theoretical value needed for denitrification
   when biomass growth is included. It is concluded that intracellular PHA
   played a major role as a carbon source for denitrification in this
   full-scale UCT process, with a corresponding phosphate uptake also in
   the anoxic zone. The biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal must,
   therefore, be regarded as interconnected. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Removal of acetate has been investigated in sewer biofilms by
   continuous-flow biofilm reactor studies simulating the conditions in a
   gravity sewer. Non-steady-state conditions are prevailing in sewers, due
   to periodic variations in substrate concentrations. In order to simulate
   two extreme situations in a gravity sewer, biofilms defined as
   high-loaded and low-loaded, respectively, were grown by continuously
   feeding wastewater to the reactors with and without supplementary
   addition of acetate. During short-term experiments with high acetate
   concentrations (1-2 h),surface removal rates of acetate and dissolved
   oxygen (DO) and observed yield coefficients were determined, as well as
   the influence of DO concentration on acetate removal rates. The
   low-loaded biofilms showed very high acetate removal rates in short-term
   experiments at high acetate concentrations. The DO uptake rates were
   low, resulting in an average observed yield coefficient of 0.79 g
   biomass produced per gram acetate (as chemical oxygen demand, COD)
   consumed. This indicated a luxury uptake by the cells probably for
   storage inside the cells or for production of extracellular polymeric
   substances. The high-loaded biofilms showed lower acetate removal rates
   during the short-term experiments, with an average yield coefficient of
   0.49 g biomass produced per gram acetate (as COD) consumed. The level of
   the acetate removal rates seemed to be related to the structure of the
   biofilm. The highest acetate removal rates were found for the low-loaded
   biofilm, where the biofilm was very hairy with `'streamers'' with a
   length of 8-9 mm. At low acetate removal rates (high-loaded biofilm),
   the `'streamer'' lengths were only 3-5 mm. The surface removal rates for
   acetate and DO seemed to follow 1/2 order approximations to biofilm
   kinetics. For a DO of 0.8 and 6.0 g/m(3), the limiting acetate
   concentrations were about 3-4 and 20 g-COD/m(3), respectively. Under
   real gravity sewer conditions, the typical concentration ranges for
   acetate and DO are at levels where any of them may be rate-limiting for
   microbial acetate removal. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A 10-litre anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR), with eight compartments, was
   used to examine the effect of organic shock loads, in the form of a step
   change in the feed chemical oxygen demand (COD) at constant hydraulic
   retention time (HRT), on reactor performance in terms of COD removal,
   and to obtain a greater insight into microbial responses and
   interactions during these shocks. In order to minimise feed variations,
   and have a totally biodegradable substrate, a synthetic carbohydrate
   (sucrose)-protein (meat extract) substrate was used. The reactor was
   operated at 20-h HRT, 4 g/litre COD (4.8 kg-COD/m(3) d), and 35 degrees
   C for 1 month as a base-line condition, and this resulted in 98\% COD
   removal. It was found that a step change in the feed to 8 g/litre COD
   (9.6 kg-COD/m(3) d) at 20-h HRT for 20 days did not affect the substrate
   removal efficiency at all; however, when the concentration was increased
   to 15 g/litre COD (18 kg-COD/m(3) d) from 4 g/litre for 20 days, the
   removal efficiency decreased to 90\%. It was found that the
   compartmentalised ABR consisted of three general zones (acidification,
   methanation, and a buffer zone where little acidification and
   methanogenesis occurs), and the function of high solids concentrations
   in the reactor was to enhance stability rather than improve COD removal.
   Hence, the structure of the ABR prevents most of the biomass being
   exposed to low pHs during shock loads, and enhances reactor stability.
   In addition, due to low pHs and high substrate concentrations in the
   first compartment, a microbial population seems to be selected which
   produces primarily acetate and butyrate rather than formate and
   propionate, and this also enhances the stability of the reactor during
   shock loads. In contrast to past results, formate did not seem to be an
   important interspecies electron carrier except under high mixing
   conditions and shock loads, and this was postulated to be due to
   differences in the structure of the microbial flocs. Based on these
   observations, the ABR holds some promise as a reactor design for
   anaerobic industrial wastewater treatment. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Two Anaerobic Baffled Reactors (ABR) were used to examine the effect of
   transient and step hydraulic shock loads on reactor performance in terms
   of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and microbial responses to
   hydraulic shocks in each compartment. The reactors were operated at 20-h
   hydraulic retention time (HRT), 4 g/litre COD and 35 degrees C as a
   base-line condition. Hydraulic shocks with an HRT of 1 h (an increase of
   20 times in the influent flowrate), 10 h and 5 h were applied to the
   reactors for 3 h, 2 weeks and 3.5 weeks, respectively, and a variety of
   key intermediates monitored over time in each compartment. The baseline
   conditions (4.8 kg-COD/m(3) d) resulted in 98\% COD removal; however,
   when the HRT decreased to 10 h (9.6 kg-COD/m(3) d) removal dropped to
   90\%, and at 5-h HRT (19.2 kg-COD/m(3) d) removal was only 52\%. It was
   found that the ABR was very stable to large transient shocks, and while
   biomass loss was substantial, it recovered back to its basline
   performance;only 9 h after the shock ceased. Tracer studies found that
   the total dead space in the reactor at 24 g-VS/litre and 20-h HRT was
   about 18\% by volume; however, when the HRT was reduced to 10 and 5 h,
   this increased to 39\%. Comparison of this data with previous results
   for varying feed concentration and recycle ratio in the ABR revealed
   that removal efficiency could be tentatively explained in terms of HRT;
   organic loading rate; the concentration/activity and kinetics of the
   biomass: the dead space in the reactor; the severity and type of
   channelling in each compartment; the substrate concentration in each
   compartment driving mass transfer into the flocs; and floc size. Hence,
   it seems that this type of reactor configuration has potential in
   treating industrial wastes that vary in both flow and concentration, and
   still enable high removal rates to be achieved. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The survival of indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli and enterococci)
   and polio viruses in Lake Kinneret were studied at different seasons,
   under various light and oxygen-sulfide regimes. Survival of the bacteria
   was dependent on environmental conditions, whereas numbers of
   polioviruses (pfu) were high for all the seasons studied. A large
   discrepancy was often noted between the methods to determine bacterial
   numbers (plate counts on selected media and direct counts). Under
   certain conditions, bacterial plate counts dropped, even though the
   direct counts remained the same or increased. These `'inactive'' or
   non-culturable cells were still viable, since glucose uptake activity
   was not impaired in such bacteria. Inactivation of E. coli appears to be
   initiated by light, although sulfide also renders the cells
   non-culturable. Survival patterns of E. coli and polioviruses in the
   lake were similar, suggesting that for the Kinneret, at least, E. coli
   is a better indicator of fecal pollution than the enterococci. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The biotransformation of thiocyanate (SCN-) and cyanate (OCN-) in a
   predominantly heterotrophic, activated sludge-derived culture was
   investigated. Acclimation and enrichment of aerobic,
   thiocyanate-degrading microorganisms led to complete thiocyanate
   oxidation to ammonia, bicarbonate, and sulfate. Low levels of cyanate
   were detected, indicating that its hydrolysis is not the rate-limiting
   step in the complete aerobic oxidation of thiocyanate. Cyanate removal
   followed the hydrolytic route to ammonia and bicarbonate under aerobic
   conditions. Abiotic assays confirmed that the observed thiocyanate
   removal was biologically mediated while cyanate hydrolysis was enhanced
   enzymatically. Neither thiocyanate nor cyanate inhibited the aerobic
   removal and assimilation of organic compounds simulating typical
   municipal wastewaters. However, partial inhibition of nitrification,
   especially the conversion of nitrite to nitrate, was observed, and was
   attributed to thiocyanate and/or free ammonia. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{After biological and/or physico-chemical treatment of stabilised
   landfill leachates, COD and salinity content are often larger than
   reject requirements. In this case, reverse osmosis can be used to treat
   effectively these residual COD and salinity. However, reverse osmosis
   feasibility is limited by the membrane fouling. In order to reduce the
   landfill leachates high fouling power, coagulation-flocculation is
   examined in this work as reverse osmosis pretreatment. Using the
   jar-test procedure, physico-chemical conditions were optimised. It
   concerns the most effective coagulant between ferric chloride and
   aluminium sulphate, the optimal pH and the most effective flocculant
   between anionic, cationic and nonionic polymers. Although 97\% reduction
   turbidity was achieved, the supernatant still presented a pronounced
   fouling power (Fouling Index above 15 min(-1)), according to the large
   supernatant iron content. By adding upstream coagulation phase both H2O2
   as oxidant and lime for pH control, iron content and Fouling Index
   supernatant were reduced underneath 2 mg/l(-1) and 5 min(-1),
   respectively. Also, supernatant could be treated by reverse osmosis
   without entailing an important membrane fouling. (C) 1997 Elsevier

   present. Three acclimation temperature ranges were tested: 0-5, 10-15,
   and 20-25 degrees C. Chlorine was tested at 0.1 and 0.5 mg/L; ozone at
   0.5 mg/L. Mortality was described by a cumulative normal distribution,
   from which times to 95\% mortality were estimated and used as a
   dependent variable for hypothesis testing. Study results showed that the
   addition of chlorine or ozone was more effective than heat alone at test
   temperatures above 30 degrees C. Compared to heat alone, the combined
   use of heat and oxidants decreased the time to 95\% mortality by more
   than 95\% at 30 degrees C. Above 30 degrees C, the benefits of the
   combined treatment strategy decreased with increasing test temperature.
   At 36 degrees C, the benefits of the combined treatment strategy over
   heat alone were minimal. Acclimation temperature was important only for
   heat alone and for mussels acclimated at 0-5 degrees C. The addition of
   chlorine or ozone at elevated temperatures can reduce mortality times by
   as much as three orders of magnitude compared to oxidant addition at
   ambient temperatures. The results of the study should be of significance
   to powerplants or industries where excess heat is available to raise
   water temperatures. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Title = {{Survival and activity of Comamonas testosteroni in mixed population}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Inoculating specialized microorganisms directly into the mixed microbial
   flora in wastewater treatment processes is the most simple and economic
   way to use their abilities (Fujita and Ike, 1994). However, success or
   failure of a bioaugmentation depends on two conditions: the survival of
   the microbe and the demonstration of its degradative activity
   (Stephenson and Stephenson, 1992). Specialized bacteria which exhibit
   extremely high degradation activities of xenobiotic compounds may be
   suitable for use in this way, since the degradation rate can be enhanced
   even if the strain maintain relatively low populations in the processes.
   For that purpose, the survival of a naturally occurring microorganism,
   Comamonas testosteroni T-2, in activated sludge microcosms was
   investigated. This bacterium was able to mineralize completely
   p-toluenesulfonate (pTS), as a model xenobiotic compound.
   Materials and methods
   Comamonas testosteroni T-2, isolated by Thurnheer et al. (1986), was
   able to degrade, as a unique source of carbon and energy,
   p-toluenesulfonate, which is mainly used as hydrotropic agent in
   detergent formulation. Activated sludge was sampled from a domestic
   wastewater treatment plant. After three centrifugations (20000 x g, 4
   degrees C, 15 min) and washing with phosphate buffer, the sludges were
   directly inoculated without enrichment culture.
   Aerobic growth studies were performed at 30 degrees C in 2-litre
   Erlenmeyer flasks containing 500 mi of mineral medium with 6 mM of pTS
   as unique source of carbon and energy (Locher, 1991). Six different
   concentrations of the specialized bacterial strain were inoculated: (i)
   O\%, containing only mixed activated sludge; (ii) 100\%, i.e. pure
   culture of C. testosteroni; (iii) 50\%; (iv) 25\%; (v) 10\%; and (vi)
   5\% of C. testosteroni in the total inoculum. In all inocula, the total
   initial biomass concentration was calculated to have each So/Xo ratios
   between 2.5 and 3 (Chudoba et al., 1992).
   pTS was determined by HPLC (Grossenbacher et al., 1986). Dissolved
   organic carbon was measured by a TOC-500 analyser (Shimadzu, Duisburg,
   Germany). Sulfate was analyzed with a FIAstar(R) 5010 system (Tecator,
   Hogonos, Sweden). Bacterial growth was determined by the measure of dry
   weight (dw) after collection of samples on membrane filters (porosity
   0.45 mu m) and by plating onto both selective pTS medium and plating
   count agar (PCA) medium for counts of pTS degrading microorganisms and
   total flora, respectively.
   Results and discussion
   pTS was removed by all inocula, even by the activated sludge alone (Fig.
   1). Residual carbon accumulated in cultures containing high
   concentration of activated sludge. The increase of sulphate
   concentrations showed that this ion was one of the final product of
   degradation with all inocula. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the xenobiotic
   compound removal was enhanced when mixed inocula were used. But, the
   higher the specialized inoculum size the faster the degradation occurred
   (Fig. 2). The time of adaptation to pTS elimination was also
   considerably shortened.
   For each mixed inoculum (50, 25, 10 and 5\% of C. testosteroni), the
   proportion of pTS degrading microorganisms in the microbial population
   was determined during the culture. As is shown in Fig. 3, the number of
   pTS degrading bacteria at the end of culture. was a function of the
   specialized inoculum size. When added in the concentration of 10-50\%,
   pTS degraders even tend to dominate the final microbial population (Fig.
   3). C. testosteroni composed about 95\% of pTS degraders. Other strains
   like Rhodococcus sp., Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas putida have also been
   isolated in small amounts.
   Contrary to many other microorganisms able to degrade aromatic sulphates
   (Focht and Williams, 1970; Ripin et al., 1971; Bird and Cain, 1974;
   Hattendorf and Hempel, 1990), C. testosteroni metabolized completely and
   rapidly pTS even under unfavorable growth conditions with high
   concentrations of sulphate or natrium chloride or with little buffered
   medium, conditions that are often found in industrial wastewaters as
   those from dyestuffs production (Fresenius et al., 1990).
   Moreover, C. testosteroni has been shown to be able to persist and to
   grow in activated sludge, whatever the inoculum size (Fig. 2). Inamori
   et al. (1992) have described six different behaviours for an exogenous
   microorganism inoculated into a complex ecosystem. The development of
   the bacterium was mainly function of environmental conditions (i.e.
   temperature, oxygen, available substrates), predation, competition and
   the strain physiological characteristics (Goldstein et al., 1985; Atlas,
   1992; Pipke et al., 1992). In the present study, growth conditions were
   optimal for the specialized microorganism, and no protozoa have been
   detected in the mixed cultures. Then, the only parameter which could
   modify the survival of C. testosteroni, in the systems was competition
   with natural flora. This factor was also minimized: activated sludges
   were taken from domestic wastewater treatment plant and few naturally
   occurring pTS degrading microorganisms were present. In addition, the
   specialized inoculum size showed to have also an influence on the
   development of the exogenous bacterium (Fig. 3). The same phenomenon was
   previously described by Inamori et al. (1992) and Fujita et al. (1994).
   These authors pointed out the importance of the physiological state and
   biological characteristics on the survival of the inoculated strain. In
   the present experiments, the exogenous bacterium belonged to the genus
   Comamonas, often isolated of activated sludge and resistant to
   starvation (McClure et al., 1989; Fitter and Chudoba, 1990). C.
   testosteroni was inoculated during the exponential phase of growth,
   while activated sludge was directly added to the medium without an
   enrichment culture step. The addition of C. testosteroni enhanced the
   degradation of pTS. Indeed, the xenobiotic compound was the only source
   of carbon and energy and the growth could not be supported by more
   easily biodegradable substrates (Dwyer et al., 1988). Nevertheless, the
   pollutant removal was delayed in ecosystems containing high ratios of
   activated sludge. Corseuil and Weber (1994) observed that the delay for
   the degradation of benzene, toluene or xylene varied inversely with the
   initial number of microbes able to use these compounds, suggesting the
   need for development of some critical population of microorganisms.
   In this study, the survival of C. testosteroni has been promoted by
   controlled environmental conditions. This specialized bacterial strain
   was able to enhance pTS degradation and dominate a natural complex
   microcosm rapidly. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Within the scope of the joint research project `'Research Network on
   Agroecosystems Munich (FAM)'' in Scheyern, Upper Bavaria, Germany, the
   concentration and distribution of pesticides were studied in sediment
   samples in order to elucidate their fate in the aquatic environment. Of
   seven recently applied pesticides, only atrazine, bifenox and their
   metabolites were measured both in the solid sediment and the porewater
   isolated from the Teufelsweiher pond (area 3155 m(2), depth 0.3-1.3 m)
   near Scheyern from 1992 to 1994. The mean total concentrations ranged
   from 33-76 ng litre(-1) in the porewater and 1.3-4.9 mu g kg(-1) in the
   solid sediment for atrazine and 9.5-23 ng litre(-1) and 4.1-18.3 mu g
   kg(-1) for bifenox, respectively. They exhibited a small spatial but
   obviously no temporal variation. This Variation depends on the sediment
   particle-size distribution, because the highest pesticide concentrations
   were found in both the smallest (< 6.3 mu m) and the largest fraction
   (63-200 mu m). The organic matter content of the sediment contributes
   mainly to this concentration distribution. In addition, comparing the in
   situ measured K-oc with the K-oc determined in the laboratory, the
   generally lower K-oc values indicate that dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   adsorbs pesticides, resulting in a higher total concentration in the
   porewater than in the absence of DOC. This `'solubilization effect'' may
   increase pesticide remobilization and availability in the aquatic
   environment. Atrazine and bifenox were mainly transported by runoff from
   the inclined areas nearby into the Teufelsweiher, but their transport
   pattern and metabolism schemes show some differences according to the
   different physiochemical properties. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, inocula of the bacterium Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP134
   including nutrients, or of nutrients alone, were released into seawater
   mesocosms every third day during a 12-day period. The purpose was to
   compare the effects of the two types of inocula on important ecosystem
   parameters. A. eutrophus was not able to grow in the mesocosms, and the
   introduced cells were mainly removed from the water column by grazing of
   heterotrophic nanoflagellates. The two types of inocula led to
   comparable changes in the concentrations of ammonium, nitrate, dissolved
   organic carbon and chlorophyll a in the mesocosms. Also, the effects on
   the abundance and production of the natural bacterioplankton were
   comparable: During the initial 6 days of the experiment, the
   inoculations stimulated the production of biomass, while a high grazing
   impact from heterotrophic nanoflagellates in combination with phosphorus
   limitation seemed to limit the bacterioplankton population in the latter
   part of the experiment. Taken together, these results indicate that the
   effects of the released bacterial cells per se were negliglible, whereas
   the nutrients accompanying the cells cause more concern as they may
   alter the structure and function of the ecosystem. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Toxic transition metals are common contaminants at Superfund sites.
   Metals adsorb strongly to soil surfaces and, therefore, are not easily
   removed by pump and treat remediation. Metal mobility is also an
   important factor in risk assessment. Bacterial extracellular polymers
   occur naturally in soils and have well-documented metal-binding
   properties. Therefore, extracellular polymers that are soluble in water
   and do not adsorb strongly to the soil matrix have the potential of
   increasing metal mobility in soils. The transport and fate of bacterial
   polymers have not received an extensive evaluation. This research
   focused on the microbial degradation of bacterial polymers and their
   mobility in porous media, processes that must be understood if polymers
   are going to be considered for inclusion in risk assessments or for use
   in remediation efforts. Mineralization of C-14-labeled bacterial
   polymers was studied using bacterial inocula obtained from four sources
   (aquifer sand, seep sediment, surface soil, and unchlorinated secondary
   effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant). The bacterial
   population in secondary effluent was found to be one of the most
   effective at extracellular polymer degradation. After 10 days, 20\% of
   the C-14-labeled polymer was mineralized by the secondary effluent
   inoculum, compared with 55\% of the C-14-labeled glucose in a parallel
   experiment. Column experiments were used to determine the mobility of
   extracellular polymer during flow through a porous medium. An aquifer
   sand was used as the solid (stationary) phase in these experiments. The
   polymer was found to have a retardation factor (R less than or equal to
   21) orders of magnitude lower than those reported for lead (R = 19,000)
   and cadmium (R = 4700) in the sand medium. The polymer was partially
   mineralized during transport through the porous media. The inhibitory
   effect of lead on polymer degradation was studied in both batch and
   column experiments. In column tests, the polymer degradation rate was
   reduced in the presence of lead. Degradation rate constants ranged from
   0.00057/min to 0.0048/min in the absence of lead and from 0.00056/min to
   0.0018/min in the presence of lead (values varied depending on the
   assumptions used in model calculations). Lead inhibition of polymer
   degradation was also observed in some batch experiments. The high
   mobility and relatively low biodegradability of bacterial polymers
   demonstrated by this work indicate that such polymers deserve further
   evaluation as facilitated;transport carriers of metals in contaminated
   groundwater. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Thirteen different bioremediation products were evaluated for their
   effectiveness in biodegrading petroleum hydrocarbons. All 13 products
   tested in this experiment were listed on the NCP product schedule. Of
   these 13 products, 12 were bioaugmentation agents and one was a
   biostimulation agent. All the products were tested for toxicity levels
   initially, using standardized protocols. The products were sampled and
   analyzed three times over a 28-day period for most-probable number (MPN)
   of hydrocarbon degraders and total petroleum hydrocarbon as separate
   fractions. A subsample was analyzed for MPN, and the rest of the sample
   was extracted and fractionated in total saturated petroleum hydrocarbons
   (TsPH) and total aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons (TarPH). This
   experiment revealed that the petroleum hydrocarbons were biodegraded to
   an extent significantly greater than that achieved by the naturally
   occurring microorganisms. After 28 days, some products reduced the TsPH
   fraction to 60\% of its initial weight and the TarPH fraction to 65\%.
   Three of the 13 products tested enhanced microbial degradation of the

Abstract = {{Modelling and multivariate analyses processed on multiple time series
   usually encounter some difficulties for three reasons: (1) sampling
   dates may be not equally spaced; (2) several values may be missing; and
   (3) the usual multivariate analyses may not succeed in separating
   long-term trends from regular periodic variations on an annual scale
   within the time series. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose a
   statistical approach based on the modelling of data by the
   non-parametric smoother Loess and the application of functional
   principal components analysis (FPCA). FPCA thereby facilitates the
   typology of variables based on their long-term trends and/or their
   periodic variation. We applied this approach to a long-term study over
   nine years (1983-1991) of the water quality of the Seine river (France)
   conducted downstream of a plant for wastewater treatment. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Transformation rates of four widely used pesticides were determined in
   surface waters that were characterised on the basis of hydrological
   status and physico-chemical, biochemical and chemical composition. Large
   variations in transformation rates were observed, ranging from 0.004 to
   0.01 day(-1) (half-life = 70-173 days) for aldicarb, 0.005 to 0.57
   day(-1) (half-life = 1-139 days) for simazine, 0.002 to 0.43 day(-1) for
   MCPA (half-life = 2-347 days) and 0.0005 to 0.24 day(-1) (half-life =
   3-1400 days) for mecoprop. Principal component analyses and step-wise
   multiple regression analyses were carried out, combining field data and
   laboratory observations, to reveal the discriminating environmental
   variables that determine the transformation rates of aldicarb, simazine,
   MCPA and mecoprop in various aqueous systems. A large set of
   environmental variables (286 observations) was reduced to three
   underlying components, explaining 84\% of the total variance in the data
   set. The first component contains variables that promote biorespiratory
   processes, in which a relationship appears between sorption potential, N
   sources and microbial activity. The second component is the
   macro/micronutrient group. The third component is the phosphorus group.
   Rapid transformation of these pesticides generally occurs in small
   hydrological systems such as field ditches and channels. Large water
   bodies such as main discharge channels or lakes seem to enhance the
   persistence of all four pesticides. Besides the hydrological status of
   the water course, historical application of the pesticide and subsequent
   adaptation of biorespiratory processes appear to be the most
   discriminating environmental factors that determine transformation rates
   of the pesticides studied. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) resulting from prefermentation of influent
   glucose were used to cultivate a bacterial population capable of
   enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) in two identical
   anaerobic/aerobic sequencing batch reactors (SBRs). An identical SBR
   receiving starch, which did not readily preferment, established only
   marginal EBPR. The Starch SBR population did not respond in batch tests
   to any of the substrates studied. In batch tests for the glucose SBR
   populations the two to five carbon VFAs, except propionic acid, induced
   greater inorganic phosphate (P-i) removal. Succinic acid also improved
   removals. Branched VFAs were superior to their linear isomers.
   Isovaleric acid improved P-i removal the most consistently, and at lower
   molar concentrations than any other VFA. The C-2 and C-5 alcohols did
   not have a significant effect on P-i removal, and neither did formate or
   methanol. The C-3 and C-4 alcohols did result in relatively small but
   consistent improvements in removals. Glucose, as well as amino acid rich
   synthetic wastewater, were both extremely detrimental to P-i removal.
   Fructose and starch did not have the same detrimental effect as glucose.

Abstract = {{Photochemical oxidation methods can be successfully used to eliminate
   hydrophilic xenobiotics in the water phase with a high efficiency. The
   influence of nitrate on the photochemical degradation kinetics of
   organic micropollutants in the presence of H2O2 proved to be different
   from its influence in the absence of H2O2. In the presence of H2O2,
   nitrate acts as an `'inner filter'' and reduces the UV light intensity
   in the photoreactor. As a consequence, the degradation rate of the
   micropollutants in the UV/H2O2 process decreased with increasing nitrate
   concentration. The degradation rate of the photolysis (UV irradiation
   only) was enhanced in the presence of nitrate. This could be explained
   by the formation of HO radicals during the nitrate photolysis. The
   influence of nitrate on the degradation rates in both UV processes was
   significantly more distinct for the irradiation of lambda(ir) = 222 nm
   compared to the degradation at lambda(ir) = 254 nm. This is mainly
   caused by a higher UV absorption of nitrate al the shorter wavelength.
   Problems with this technology can arise because nitrite and
   peroxynitrite were formed during UV irradiation of nitrate. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Column trials were used to characterize the downward movement of sodium,
   potassium, ammonium, orthophosphate and chloride (all typically present
   in cattle slurry) through the soil profile. The soil used was a pasture
   soil developed over amphibolite; trials were carried out with the < 2 mm
   fraction, each column being packed with soil from a single horizon. A
   feed solution containing known concentrations of the above ions was
   applied to the top of each column, and ion concentrations were
   determined in outflow samples. Chloride passed through the soil more
   rapidly than water. Sodium passed through at about the same rate as
   water (i.e. a retardation factor of about 1). Potassium and ammonium
   both showed a clear lag (retardation factors of about 1.5-2.5).
   Orthophosphate was almost totally retained. For all columns, sodium
   outflow exceeded sodium input, possibly as a result of displacement of
   soil sodium by other cations in the feed solution; in addition, the
   time-course of sodium outflow suggests a pulsatile pattern of
   sorption/release. Differences in the cation retention capacities of the
   three soil horizons studied appear to be largely attributable to
   differences in clay content. The retention of orthophosphate is probably
   attributable to reaction with iron and aluminium oxides, which are
   abundant in the soil studied. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{31}},

Pages = {{2899-2909}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Rapid small-scale column tests (RSSCTs) were evaluated for their ability
   to predict atrazine removal in pilot-scale granular activated carbon
   (GAC) adsorbers. The performance of both virgin and preloaded GACs was
   tested. Atrazine removal by virgin GAC was studied in post-filter
   adsorbers at Toulouse, France, and Choisy-le-Roi, France, using
   empty-bed contact times (EBCTs) of 10.3 and 14 min, respectively. For
   virgin GAC, RSSCTs successfully simulated atrazine removal over
   large-scale operating times of about 3.5-7 months. However, RSSCTs
   significantly overestimated atrazine removal at longer operating times.
   Atrazine removal by preloaded GAC was studied in pilot-scale post-filter
   adsorbers at Choisy-le-Roi, France, after preloading times of 5 months
   and 20 months. EBCTs were approximately 8.5 min. To describe the
   performance of pilot-scale adsorbers containing preloaded GAC, RSSCTs
   were initiated with virgin activated carbon, and preloading was
   simulated prior to the spiking of atrazine. For a pilot-scale adsorber
   containing GAC that had been preloaded for 5 months, the RSSCT data
   effectively described atrazine removal. However, the RSSCT was not
   successful in predicting atrazine removal by GAC after a preloading time
   of 20 months. Discrepancies between RSSCT and pilot data for long
   service times or after extended preloading periods may have been due to
   enhanced adsorption of background organic matter in the presence of
   oxygen. Overall, RSSCTs were judged to be most useful for predicting the
   initial performance of adsorbers containing virgin GAG. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Yugoslavia's exposure to UN sanctions since 1992 resulted in a
   production reduction in almost every field of economic activity, and
   that caused a decrease of pollutant inputs in the water ecosystems.
   Although the boundary profiles of international rivers registered no
   change, an improvement was detected in river water quality on profiles
   that run deeper inside the country. The quality of Yugoslav rivers in
   period from 1991 to 1995 is presented in this paper. The quality of the
   Danube, Tisa, Sava, Drina, Morava, Ibar, Bojana and Moraca is evaluated
   by the concentrations of characteristic parameters. The specific
   situation where the reduction in industrial and agricultural production
   occurred, together with reduced traffic activities and uncontrolled
   black-market import of fertilizers, influence the changes in
   concentrations of water quality parameters. It is possible to conclude,
   based on analysed data, that a general improvement in the quality of
   Yugoslav rivers has occurred during the period of observation,

Abstract = {{Reverse osmosis and vacuum distillation are commonly used for
   desalination when purifying drinking water from sea or brackish water.
   The ability of these methods to remove nodularin, a hepatotoxin produced
   by the cyanobacteria Nodularia spumigena, was investigated. For this
   purpose, natural brackish water was contaminated with toxic algal
   material. Nodularin concentrations of raw and purified water were
   determined after a solid-phase extraction procedure employing
   high-performance liquid chromatography. In the case of reverse osmosis
   (Freshwater(R) MT 5000B) the initial nodularin concentration was 10.0 mu
   g/litre, but, after a concentration programme which included recycling
   the wastewater and discharging the purified water, the final nodularin
   concentration after 19.5 h was 32.3 mu g/litre. The nodularin
   concentration of the purified water always remained below the limit of
   quantitation, which was 0.5 mu g/litre, but, by the end of the
   experiment, when both the nodularin and salt concentrations had
   increased threefold, traces of nodularin were detected. The specific
   conductivity of the purified water increased simultaneously. In the case
   of vacuum distillation, the nodularin concentration of brackish raw
   water was 70 mu g/litre and the test was performed using a Rotavapor
   R-114 instrument at 60 degrees C to simulate an existing purification
   method. No nodularin was detected in the distillate. Both reverse
   osmosis and vacuum distillation removed nodularin effectively. When
   brackish water is to be purified by reverse osmosis, conductivity
   measurement can be used to monitor the effectiveness of the purification
   result. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1997}},

Abstract = {{Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and inductively coupled
   plasma/mass spectrometry (ICP/MS) have been performed to study the
   degree of contamination due to toxic heavy metals and other pollutants
   in water and sediments of a Moroccan river. Water and sediments samples
   have been collected from seven locations from this river along 41 km, as
   shown in Fig. 1.
   The sediment samples were irradiated in the Osiris nuclear reactor in an
   epithermal neutron flux of 10(13) n cm(-2) s(-1) for 2 h in high purity
   aluminium paper. The gamma-rays subsequently emitted were measured for 1
   h, after a decay time of 1 and 15 days, with a coaxial GeLi detector
   coupled to a 4600 pulse-height analyser. The computational K-o method
   was used to determine the concentration of elements of interest (Elmir,
   1994; El Nimr et al., 1981).
   As summarized in Table 1 and presented in Figs 2, 3 and 4, the results
   showed maximum concentrations for As,Ba, Pr, Co, Cr, Cs, Fe, La, Rb, Sb
   and Zn in stations situated between I and 15 km below Meknes city. They
   also showed that the sedimentation takes place along 15 km and decreased
   at S7, 21 km below the city. The existence of toxic elements such as As,
   Pr and Sb is detrimental to aquatic systems. Perhaps it could explain
   the absence of normal aquatic life in the river (Rodier et al., 1992;
   Phillips et al., 1993). A maximum concentration of Cr, Fe and Zn in S4
   and S6 is correlated to the different utilization of these elements in
   human activities (tannery, textile and ceramic industries etc.) (Jenkins
   et al., 1992; Minear, 1982), and their origin is mainly anthropogenic.
   Water samples were decanted and plated in polythene bottles and stored
   at 4 degrees C. All the samples have been analysed using the ICP/MS
   method (Fardy, 1992; Howard, 1992; Jarvis, 1992). The measurements were
   carried out using a PQ2-Plasma Quad system (Fisons) with a pneumatic
   nebulizer. Data acquisition was controlled using PQ-Vision software. The
   machine was calibrated with `'SPEX'' commercial solutions diluted at 10
   ppb. Some elements such as Fe, Zn and Ca were analysed by INAA after
   evaporation on high purity aluminium at room temperature. Samples and
   standards were irradiated in the Orphee reactor in a thermal neutron
   flux of 10(13) n cm(-2) s(-1).
   As summarized in Table 2 and presented in Figs 5, 6 and 7, the
   concentrations of Fe and Zn in water are maximum at S1 (Fig. 5). These
   Values were confirmed with INAA, and the fluctuation is less than 10\%.
   The results confirmed that the source is rich in Zn and deposits it
   along the course of the river. The concentration of Mn increased from S4
   to S7 (Fig. 6). This may be explained by its utilization in ceramics,
   painting and agriculture as a fertilizer (Forstner, 1991; Minear, 1982).
   The high quantity of Pb in S6 can be explained by its use in industries
   involving accumulators, ceramics and caoutchouc. Other elements such as
   Co, Ni, Se and V were also detected. They increased from S4 onwards but
   the concentrations were low (approximate to ng/g). The high and
   quasi-constant concentration of Ca could be due to its natural
   geological origin (Abdellaoui, 1990).
   With the aim of detecting eventual diffusion of pollutants from the
   river to an adjacent well, three samples, namely Meknes city fresh
   water, water from station S6 and that from the well, were analysed using
   the ICP/MS method. The results are summarized in Table 3. They indicate
   a high concentration of Fe, Pb and Zn in the fresh water. (C) 1997

   the acid effluent by 50\%, thus reducing the AOX in the influent to the
   biological treatment plant by 30\%, in agreement with the laboratory
   tests. The performance of the biological treatment was not adversely
   affected by the chemical pretreatment in terms of COD, BOD and AOX
   removal. The percent AOX reduction by combined chemical and biological
   treatment ranged from 53 to 59\% depending on the operating conditions
   of the biological treatment plant. The chemical pretreatment

   due to the action of radicals. Tomato wastewaters, on the other hand,
   show a higher reactivity even with UV radiation alone. The quantum yield
   for tomato wastewaters with an initial COD of 930 mg O-2 l(-1) was found
   to be 0.7 mol O-2 photon(-1) and decreased with reaction time. The
   combined effect of UV radiation and hydrogen peroxide at a 0.01 M
   concentration on tomato wastewaters leads to about 25\% COD reduction
   while TOC was unchanged. The contribution of radical reactions in this

Abstract = {{The oxidation of two wastewaters with ozone combined with hydrogen
   peroxide or UV radiation (254 nm) has been studied. The oxidation yields
   of these systems were compared with those from ozonation alone at
   similar experimental conditions. It was found that O-3/H2O2 oxidation
   leads to important increases in COD degradation rate (i.e. 86\% at pH 6
   in tomato wastewaters). The differences between the oxidation types (O-3
   and O-3/H2O2) diminish with increase in pH. With distillery wastewaters
   the presence of hydrogen peroxide hardly increases the oxidation rate.
   However, the combination of O-3/UV radiation was the best oxidation
   method applied because of the improvements achieved in both COD and TOC
   disappearance rates compared to those of ozonation alone, regardless of
   wastewater type treated. As happened with other oxidation systems, the
   COD and TOC reductions were higher in tomato wastewater oxidation.
   Different kinetic parameters were also determined in order to quantify
   the reactivity of wastewaters towards the oxidation systems applied. (C)

Abstract = {{The degree of association of the pyrethroid insecticide fenvalerate to
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) was measured with the reverse-phase
   partition coefficient (K-rp) using Sep-Paks. Natural DOM of four size
   fractions ranging from 1 K molecular weight up to 1 mu m was isolated
   from Jack Lake and Luther Marsh in Ontario, Canada, and compared to the
   commercial DOM substitute Aldrich humic acid (AHA). A generator column
   method to produce fenvalerate-saturated DOM solutions necessary for
   determining K-rp was compared to the standard method of mixing the
   components in a bottle until equilibrium was reached. Using the bottle
   method, the association of fenvalerate to DOM was not significantly
   different (alpha = 0.05) for any of the DOM. With the generator
   column-produced solutions, the mean K-rp of the smallest fraction (1 K <
   DOM < 10 K) was significantly lower (2.2 x 10(3) litres/kg, p < 0.00001)
   than the mean of each of the three larger fractions and AHA, which were
   not different from each other (8.0 x 10(4) to 3.0 x 10(5) litres/kg).
   Jack Lake DOM had higher K-rp values than Luther Marsh, which
   predominantly contained lower molecular weight DOM. The generator column
   method produced more precise K-rp measurements between fenvalerate and
   DOM than the bottle method; however, the use of Sep-Paks to measure DOM
   association with hydrophobic chemicals which exhibit high breakthrough,
   such as fenvalerate, may produce questionable results. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of sodium cyanide (NaCN), iron-cyanide complexes and a blast
   furnace effluent on the growth of the unicellular marine diatom
   Nitzschia closterium was investigated. Due to the volatile nature of
   HCN, the free and total cyanide concentrations in ail test solutions
   were monitored dairy to ensure that average daily losses of free cyanide
   did not exceed 5\%. The iron-cyanide complexes were less toxic than the
   NaCN, with 72-h EC50 values of 57, 127 and 275 mu g total-CN litre(-1)
   for NaCN, K3Fe(CN)(6) and K4Fe(CN)(6), respectively. The estimated
   lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) for NaCN was 10 mu g
   litre(-1). The toxicity of the cyanide complexes was largely due to free
   cyanide (HCN + CN-) with possible additional toxicity caused by
   dissociation of the complexes at the algal cell membrane. The toxicity
   of an effluent from a blast furnace drawdown episode also correlated
   well with the toxicity of free cyanide. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Biological aerated filters (BAFs) are submerged three-phase fixed-media
   reactors for wastewater treatment. A major characteristic of BAF
   reactors is the use of granular media which allows solids separation as
   well as secondary or tertiary biological treatment in one unit. The aim
   of this work was to design a simple empirical model relating influent
   soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) to effluent sCOD and reactor
   height, verify experimentally the suitability of this model and
   ascertain the relationship between model constants and reactor
   performance. The theoretical model was based on that designed for
   trickling filters as both fixed-film processes show a similar plug flow
   pattern. Two reactors were set up to run parallel treating settled
   domestic sewage using media identical in size and shape, except one was
   less dense than water (relative density 0.92) and the other was denser
   than water (relative density 1.05). The reactors were run upflow with
   liquid flowrates of 0.29-0.58 m(3) d(-1) (0.2-0.5 litres min(-1)) and an
   air:liquid ratio of 10:1. After 4 weeks from start-up, steady-state was
   reached. From this point, samples were taken at different heights along
   the reactors at timed intervals and profiles of sCOD removal against
   reactor height were produced. This analysis was repeated for a number of
   different flowrates and organic loadings (0.57-1.40 kg sCOD m(-3)
   d(-1)). The resulting data was then used with the empirical model, which
   was based on a first-order reaction, to calculate the values of k{*}
   (overall process constant) and n (media factor). A higher value of k{*}
   was found for the floating media (55) compared with the value found for
   the sunken media (33). This indicated the greater efficiency of sCOD
   removal in the floating media. The values of the media constants were
   similar, showing the similarity in the media shape and size. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Precipitation of sludges with ferrous iron salts can increase the total
   phosphorus content of sludges. However, the forms of phosphorus thus
   precipitated have never been directly investigated. Three dewatered
   urban sewage sludges were sampled from wastewater treatment plants
   performing dephosphatation with the addition of FeSO4 (two anaerobically
   digested sludges and an activated sludge). Phosphorus species in sludges
   were investigated by X-ray diffraction, Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy and
   scanning electron microscopy. Vivianite, a ferrous phosphate, was
   observed in the three sludges. In the two anaerobically digested
   sludges, 60-67\% of the total sludge iron was accounted for by an
   oxidized vivianite. In the activated sludge, 43\% of the total iron was
   accounted for by a non-oxidized vivianite. In addition, calcium
   phosphate particles were observed in this sludge. The effects of sludge
   treatment (FeSO4 addition, digestion, dewatering) and air-drying in the
   laboratory on the formation and oxidation of vivianite are discussed.

Abstract = {{Four laboratory-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (ASBRs) were
   used to treat synthetic wastewaters at COD concentrations of 1000, 800,
   600 and 400 mg/liter (BOD5 of 490, 392, 294 and 196 mg/liter
   respectively). The ASBRs were operated at temperatures of 35, 25, 20 and
   15 degrees C. Reactor I was operated at a 48-h HRT, reactor 2 at 24-h
   HRT, reactor 3 at 16-h HRT and reactor 4 at a 12-h HRT. The four
   substrate concentrations were treated in each reactor and each
   temperature. Results of the study show 80-90\% soluble COD removal
   efficiency at the various substrate concentrations, temperatures and
   HRTs, except during 15 degrees C treatment of the more concentrated
   wastewater at the shorter HRTs. These findings show that the ASBR
   process could be used for the treatment of low-strength wastewaters at
   low temperatures, usually treated aerobically with high energy
   expenditures and large amounts of sludge production. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted to determine the effects of ozonation on
   sorption of aquatic natural organic matter (NOM) onto biofilm using
   bench-scale packed-bed reactors. It was found that 18-22\% of NOM
   measured as dissolved organic carbon (DOG), and 28-30\% measured as
   chloroform formation potential, was removed from the water without
   biodegradation. The bulk of the NOM removal was attributed to
   biosorption of low-molecular-weight compounds-less than 3000 Da. At a
   dose of 1 g-O-3/g-DOC, ozonation was not found to have a significant
   effect on biosorption of NOM. Ozonation simultaneously decreased the
   molecular size and increased the acidity of NOM compounds, and it was
   concluded that the effects counterbalanced each other at an ozone dose
   of 1:1, resulting in no significant change in NOM sorption. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Anaerobic microcosms of subsurface soils from three location were used
   to investigate the separate effects of several electron donors on
   tetrachloroethylene (PCE) dechlorination activity. The substrates tested
   were methanol, lactate, acetate and sucrose. Various levels of
   sulfate-reducing, acetogenic, fermentative, and methanogenic activity
   were observed in all sediments. PCE dechlorination was detected in all
   microcosms, but the amount of dehalogenation varied by several orders of
   magnitude. Trichloroethylene as the primary dehalogenation product;
   however, small amounts of cis-1,2-dichloroethylene,
   1,1-dichloroethylene, and vinyl chloride were also detected in several
   microcosms. Lactate-amended microcosms showed large amounts of
   dehalogenation in two of the three sediments. One of the two sediments
   which showed positive activity with lactate also had large amounts of
   dehalogenation with methanol. Amendment with formate, acetate, or
   sucrose resulted in only slight dehalogenation in the three sediments.
   Elevated levels of dehalogenation were not consistently associated with
   any observable anaerobic metabolisms (sulfate reduction, acetogenesis,
   fermentation, or methanogensis). (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorine bleaching effluents are problematic for anaerobic wastewater
   treatment due to their high methanogenic toxicity and low
   biodegradability. Presently, alternative bleaching processes are being
   introduced, such as elemental chlorine-free (ECF) and total
   chlorine-free (TCF) bleaching. The methanogenic toxicity and anaerobic
   biodegradability of ECF and TCF bleaching effluents from
   oxygen-delignified eucalyptus Kraft pulp were compared with those of
   different chlorine bleaching sequences. The effluents from chlorine and
   ECF bleaching sequences had similar methanogenic toxicities, with 50\%
   inhibiting concentrations (50\%IC) of 0.65-1.48 g-COD/litre. Only the
   TCF bleaching effluent was distinctly less toxic, with a 50\%IC of 2.3
   g-COD/litre. The fact that the ECF bleaching effluent was not less toxic
   than that of chlorine bleaching, as well as the residual toxicity of
   TCF, indicate that other substances aside from organohalogens contribute
   to the high methanogenic toxicity in bleaching effluents. Literature
   data is presented suggesting that wood resin compounds released by
   alkaline extraction stages might be important inhibitory substances in
   all bleaching processes. Oxygen-delignified bleaching effluents of
   eucalyptus were found to be highly biodegradable. When tested at
   subtoxic concentrations, the chlorine and TCF bleaching effluent COD
   were anaerobically degraded by 67 and 75\%, respectively. In both cases,
   methane production accounted for most of the COD removed. Therefore, the
   TCF process also enhances the anaerobic biodegradability of bleaching
   effluents to a small extent. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The use of standard Colilert (IDEXX) for the detection of coliforms and
   E. coli in potable water has been studied. In a large survey, Colilert
   recovered E. coli from similar numbers of samples to membrane filtration
   whilst recovery of coliforms was higher with Colilert. Further
   experiments to study the sensitivity of the two methods using pure
   cultures, showed that there was no significant difference in their
   ability to recover E. coli. Studies on a newly developed form of
   Colilert (Colilert 18) which is said to give results within 18 h showed
   that there was no significant difference between the two forms of the
   product. Use of the Colilert Is in a quantitative format using
   QuantiTray(TM) showed that the product gave similar quantitative results
   to membrane filtration, but was easier to read and was less time
   consuming. Subculture of a proportion of positive samples demonstrated
   that there was no need to confirm results obtained with the
   Colilert/QuantiTray(TM) system. The results of this study suggest that
   both formulations of Colilert are suitable alternatives to the United
   Kingdom membrane filtration method for monitoring the bacteriological
   quality of drinking water. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The hydraulic characteristics of a four-stage bench-scale rotating
   biological contactor (RBC) were studied using its three major operating
   parameters: (i) liquid flow rate, (ii) rotational speed of disc and
   (iii) degree of submergence. The liquid flow rate and the degree of
   submergence have been combined to obtain the dimensionless parameter
   Reynolds number (Re), whereas the liquid flow rate and the rotational
   speed have been grouped together, leading to another dimensionless
   parameter, Modified Froude number (Fr). Moreover, the different stages
   of RBC have been expressed in terms of dimensionless length (L-R) The
   overall dispersion number (d = D/UL, where D is the dispersion
   coefficient, U is the velocity of liquid and L, is the length of liquid
   flow path) of the flow regime in the RBC has been formulated by a
   hydraulic model based on multiple linear regression analysis through a
   package of 96 observations on tracer response data in the RBC operating
   at flow rates of 0.04-21.90 m(3)/day, rotational speeds of 1-15 rpm and
   degrees of submergence of 32-60\%, resulting in Re values in the range
   of 51-2500 and Fr values in the range of 5.61 x 10(-6) to 1.26 x 10(-3).
   The overall value of d has reduced significantly, by 76\%, from the
   first stage (2.48) to the fourth and final stage (0.60). It increased
   with the increase of Re and A values. The range (0.048-8.24) of the
   observed values of d shows insignificant deviation from the
   corresponding values predicted by the following proposed hydraulic model
   for a multi-stage RBC reactor. The model with a multiple correlation
   coefficient value of 95\% is
   d(p)= D/UL = 0.32(Fr)(0.57)(Re)(0.75)/(L-R)(1.1)

Abstract = {{This study addresses the question of how a general seasonal
   eutrophication model, WASP5, can handle daily phytoplankton and nutrient
   dynamics in perturbed microcosms for 1- to 2-week periods of time. It is
   intended to explore both the interpretative and the predictive
   capabilities of conventional kinetic formulations. The general method
   adopted in this study is to first apply EUTRO5, a component of WASP5, to
   a well-behaved microcosm, calibrating the parameter values and
   reformulating equations if necessary. Next, the calibrated model is
   subjected to testing in other microcosm experiments, with altered
   parameter values if necessary. Model performance is further explored
   through sensitivity analyses to try to `'explain'' the observed kinetics
   in the experiments, and a two-way ANOVA is finally applied to the
   simulated vs observed evolution curves of the three main variables, i.e.
   chlorophyll a, soluble-P and ammonia-N in all experiments and microcosms
   studied. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Wastewater produced from the processing of olive oil presents a serious
   pollution problem in the Mediterranean area, because of its high
   chemical oxygen demand (GOD) level (100-200 g/litre), and the high level
   of other organic and inorganic compounds. This paper examines the growth
   of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica ATCC 20255 on olive mill wastewater.
   The practical results presented show that the yeast is capable of
   reducing the COD level by 80\% in 24 h, when grown in a 3.5 litre
   fermenter. This produces a useful biomass of 22.45 g/litre and the
   enzyme lipase. During this process, most of the organic and inorganic
   substances are consumed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The estimation of biomass concentrations in algal growth inhibition
   tests from measurements of pigment fluorescence in extracts of 20\%
   sample (final v/v) prepared by direct addition to
   dimethylsulfoxide/acetone solvent offers several advantages compared to
   currently used direct or indirect methods. The extraction stops the
   electron transfer and other processes which interact with chlorophyll
   fluorescence when measured in vivo. As a result the response is
   stabilized and the sensitivity improved. The injection method is very
   fast, has a high potential for automation, allows storage of samples and
   is suitable for small sample volumes (e.g. 0.2 ml). The typical initial
   cell density in standard toxicity tests of 10(4) cells ml(-1) of
   Selenastrum capricornutum was measured precisely with a standard
   fluorimeter set-up, and 10(3) cells ml(-1) of S. capricornutum was
   measured reliably with a sensitive fluorimeter. At low levels of
   toxicity by the model test compound potassium dichromate, the proposed
   fluorescence method resulted in very similar inhibition figures as
   obtained with electronic particle counting. At high levels of toxicity,
   on the other hand, biomass determinations from pigment fluorescence
   readings were markedly affected by toxicant-induced changes of the algal
   physiology. The low effect part of a dose response curve is normally
   that one of major interest, and biomass estimation errors associated
   with fluorescence measurements on extracts are thus considered
   acceptable in most situations. When the entire dataset was applied for
   endpoint estimation by the Weibull model, EC-1 estimates were markedly
   affected by the curve fitting to data in the high inhibition range,
   while EC-10 and EC-20 were less and EC-50 almost unaffected. The method
   is expected to be less suitable for toxicity testing of herbicides
   specifically inhibiting photosynthesis. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The percent regeneration (PR) of activated carbon (AC) regenerated under
   various conditions is frequently assessed via batch equilibrium
   adsorption (loading) tests followed by regeneration and reloading. Newly
   developed and existing methods for calculating PR, which are based on
   different experimental protocols, were assessed. The PRs for methods 1-3
   are based on the ratio of the solid phase concentrations (or loadings)
   obtained using regenerated AC to that obtained using virgin AC. Method 1
   requires multiple reloading tests with different initial conditions to
   estimate the regenerated AC loading in equilibrium with the same liquid
   phase concentration as the virgin AC. Method 2, which uses identical
   initial conditions in the adsorption and re-adsorption tests, yields
   loadings that are in equilibrium with different liquid phase
   concentrations. Method 3 uses the virgin AC isotherm to calculate the
   ratio between loadings at the liquid phase concentration reached during
   the reloading test. Methods 1 and 3 are more correct because they
   compare isotherm loadings at the same equilibrium liquid phase
   concentrations. Method 2 should be avoided and the results of studies
   using it need to be re-evaluated. Methods 1-3 yielded unrealistically
   high PR values for the control (ineffective regenerations) experiments,
   because they do not account for contaminant left on the AC. PR4,
   developed to consider residual contaminant, described the control
   experiments well and should also be the most appropriate for
   low-intensity regenerations. Unfortunately, it is impossible to
   establish a priori the degree of the intensity of a regeneration. In
   addition, if the regeneration greatly reduces the adsorption capacity of
   the AC, PR4 will yield nonsensical values, so it must be used with
   extreme care. A sensitivity analysis showed that, although PR3 is not as
   consistent as PR4, on average their values are relatively close. For
   intense regenerations, method 1 is the correct method to evaluate PR;
   however, it requires more experimental effort than the alternatives. A
   methodology was proposed for exploratory regeneration research involving
   many conditions to reduce the experimental effort required to calculate
   PR so as not to limit the scope of the regeneration study. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The paper describes a method to determine bacterial biomass-COD in
   wastewater treatment systems in the presence of particulate matter. A
   quantitative measure of biomass-COD concentration could greatly enhance
   the accuracy and reliability of wastewater treatment models that rely on
   the component `'biomass concentration'', which is usually expressed in
   terms of GOD. Rarely is biomass-COD determined directly, despite the
   existence of microbiological methods for this measurement. Here, we have
   used a classic microbiological method, acridine orange stain direct
   counting (AODC), to count the number of bacteria. The average cell
   volume of wastewater bacteria was used to determine a conversion factor
   of 20 x 10(-11) mg-COD/cell for calculating bacterial biomass-COD with a
   fast, reliable and simple method applied to wastewater samples in the
   presence of particulate substrate. Bacterial biomass-COD was measured in
   five different wastewater treatment systems and compared to the
   particulate COD. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Enhanced concentrations of phosphorus entering the aquatic systems have
   been linked with eutrophication and its associated problems. The EC
   Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, adopted in May 1991, included
   effluent standards for phosphorus in the U.K. for the first time. The
   need for an efficient and cost-effective phosphorus removal process has
   now become apparent. Two pilot-scale columns, an aerated filter packed
   with seeded expanded shale and an anoxic filter packed with plastic
   media, were operated using settled sewage feed. Iron (II) sulphate
   heptahydrate solution was dosed onto the top of the aerated filter at
   varying ratios of total phosphorus to iron. The performance of the plant
   with respect to BOD, GOD, TKN and suspended solids removal was
   unaffected by chemical dosing. A significant reduction of nitrification
   occurred; however, this may be linked to increased BOD and ammonia
   loading. The run time of the biological aerated filter was not
   significantly affected by chemical addition. The choice of chemical dose
   used depends on the stability of process required, which increases with
   increasing dose, capital available and the EC limits imposed on the
   effluent to be discharged. To meet EC requirements, the most favourable
   chemical dosing ratio was 1:1.25 (weight ratio P:Fe). (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an experimental methodology for estimating
   saturation concentrations of oxygen in surface waters and wastewater
   that employs commonly available analytic techniques (polarographic probe
   and Winkler titration) for dissolved oxygen (DO) analysis. Because DO
   analysis techniques can contain significant measurement bias, a protocol
   intended to minimize the estimate uncertainty is proposed. The
   protocol's chief attribute is its ability to estimate solubility
   indirectly, i.e. it avoids the complication of equilibrating samples
   with the atmosphere and uses measurements with unsaturated water to
   project a value of solubility. Using this protocol, saturation
   concentrations in Mississippi River water collected in Minnesota were
   measured. The ratio of the saturation concentration of Mississippi River
   water to pure distilled water varied seasonally in 1993 and 1994, with
   slightly higher ratios in the winter months and lower values in the late
   summer and fall. The lowest measured ratio was more than 8\% below the
   equivalent clean water value. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Stormwater discharges are intermittent inputs into receiving waters. In
   overall, the wet-weather Row periods in the receiving waters resulting
   from stormwater flows may represent only a fraction of the annual flow.
   In most humid regions the probability of wet weather overflow from urban
   storm sewers is between 4 and 8\% and is less for combined sewer
   overflows. A methodology which enables one, using probabilistic
   principles, to calculate risk of wet-weather dicharges to aquatic
   ecology (aquatic life) is presented. Risk is a joint probability that a
   genus will be acutely affected by the concentration. It is a
   dimensionless, additive number, i.e. risks by several pollutants can be
   added together to approximate the synergic effects. It can be used for
   ranking pollutants in wet-weather discharges as well for ranking the
   discharges themselves. A reciprocal of the risk is the recurrence
   interval between the occurrences of such damages. The methodology was
   documented by calculating risks of four metals in an urban stream. (C)

   regression analysis of data from a group of 24 piezometers, predicting
   the increments of the water-table at given time-steps. Rainfall, present
   depth of the water-table, average maximum temperatures and lapse time
   between two measurements have been used as independent variables. The
   regressions reach r(2)-values over 0.8. The model prediction of the
   water-table dynamics based on the regression equations fits the data for
   most of the measurement points. Differences in the coefficients of

Abstract = {{An experimental study was undertaken to observe the effect of electron
   acceptor conditions on the enzyme synthesis potential in pure cultures
   of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (gram positive) and Pseudomonas
   saccharophilia (gram negative). An appropriate experimental methodology
   was developed to observe enzymes synthesis over a time period by using
   enzyme assay technique. It was found that the development of the starch
   hydrolytic enzyme system in both the cultures was strongly affected by
   the type of electron acceptor conditions. The relative change in the
   enzyme synthesis due to change in electron acceptor conditions was more
   pronounced in B. amyloliquefaciens as compared to P. saccharophilia. In
   case of B. amyloliquefaciens the calculated reduction factors eta(no3)
   and eta(fe) ranged from 0.13 to 0.21 and 0.04 to 0.06, respectively,
   whereas for P. saccharophila they were found to range from 0.40 to 0.54
   and 0.20 to 0.27, respectively. An apparent relationship between the
   growth rates of the cultures during active growth phase in minimal
   starch medium and their specific enzyme synthesis potential was
   observed. Further, the hydrolytic enzymes were found to be released in
   the bulk solution and the activity of the synthesized enzymes was found
   to be independent of electron acceptor conditions. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A predictive model is developed for the hydraulic behavior, such as bad
   height and overall gas, liquid, and solid holdups (volume fractions), of
   three-phase fluidized-bed reactors. The model uses process parameters,
   such as reactor dimensions, particle properties, and gas and liquid
   flowrates, as input variables. A wake model is applied to predict the
   liquid holdup, while the solids holdup is obtained by iteration based on
   material balance. Experimental results to evaluate the three-phase
   fluidization model are obtained from a laboratory-scale reactor using
   two sizes of clean glass beads under wide range of gas and liquid
   velocities. Modeling predictions and experimental results agree
   quantitatively for two-phase and three-phase conditions. The model is
   further applied to analyze fluidized beds with biofilm-coated media.
   Biofilm accumulation alters the drag coefficient (Go) and bed expansion
   index (n). Applying a modified correlation for Co to biofilm systems
   found in literature, the authors propose a new correlation for n which
   shows little dependence on the particle terminal Reynolds number. (C)

Abstract = {{An entrapped-mixed-microbial cell (EMMC) process was investigated for
   its simultaneous removal of carbon and nitrogen in a single reactor
   which was operated on alternate schedules of aerobic, anoxic and
   anaerobic conditions. Two different size carrier cubes, with 20-mm
   (large) and IO-mm (medium) sides, were studied. The synthetic
   wastewater, with concentrations of 250 mg/liter of (SCOD) and 26
   mg/liter of NH4+-N was used as influent substrate. At 25 degrees +/- 2
   degrees C, both (SCOD) and nitrogen could be removed simultaneously at
   96 and 84\%, respectively, for the medium carrier operated at the
   hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 9 h and the ratio of aeration to
   non-aeration of 1:2. For the large carrier, removal efficiencies of SCOD
   and nitrogen of 96 and 76\%, respectively, were achieved under the
   operation at the HRT of 9 h and the ratio of aeration to non-aeration of
   1:1. The low-temperature (10 degrees C) effect on the EMMC process (both
   carriers) for nitrogen removal (about 47-50\%) was larger than the
   carbon removal (92-94\%). The economic analysis indicates that the EMMC
   process has comparable net present worth (NPW) comparing activated
   sludge system and less operation and maintenance and land requirement
   than the conventional biological processes for removal of carbon and
   nitrogen. Therefore, the EMMC process is suitable to be used for
   replacement and upgrading of existing wastewater treatment plants were
   land is strictly limited. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of temperature shock to the activity of thermophilic biogranules
   in two upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors were
   investigated. Treating wastewater containing 9450 mg litre(-1) of
   sucrose, equivalent to 10000 mg litre(-1) of COD (chemical oxygen
   demand) at 55 degrees C and 24 h of hydraulic retention time
   (corresponding to a loading rate of 10 g-COD litre(-1) day(-1), both
   reactors consistently removed 85-90\% of GOD. The temperature in
   Reactor-I was raised to 65 degrees C for 8 days, while that in Reactor-D
   was lowered to 37 degrees C for 16 days. The temperature shocks
   significantly reduced the reactors' performance: COD removal
   efficiencies were lowered to 60\% for Reactor-I and to only 40\% for
   Reactor-D. Sludge yields during temperature shock were lowered by 25\%.
   In addition, the temperature shock also caused severe biomass washout,
   lowering of pH and accumulation of fatty acids, in particular
   propionate. However, both reactors were able to fully recover their
   efficiencies within 18 days, after the pH was rectified by the addition
   of alkaline and the temperature was re-adjusted to the normal 55 degrees
   C. Results of specific methanogenic activity (SMA) tests show that
   acetotrophic methanogens were not as sensitive to the temperature shock
   as other bacteria. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a technique to analyse and to enrich the
   fluorescent dyes uranine (Acid Yellow 73) and sulphorhodamine B (Acid
   Red 52) from leakage water. A solid-phase extraction (SPE) using C18
   material was developed for the pretreatment and the extraction of the
   dyes. ENV+(R), a highly crosslinked polystyrene divinylbenzene polymer,
   was a suitable sorbent for uranine but not for sulphorhodamine B.
   Additionally, the samples were purified from interferences and natural
   background substances. The optimum pH value was 3 for the extraction,
   because the molecules were then uncharged and retained by the sorbent. A
   methanol/aqueous buffer solution (pH 10) was required for eluting the
   dyes from the sorbent, since the molecules were then negatively charged
   and soluble in methanol/water. After extraction the samples were pure
   enough to be analysed by HPLC with the fluorescence detector. Using HPLC
   analysis the tracers could be measured simultaneously under constant
   conditions.,The tracer enrichment was 500-fold by SPE, so much lower
   amounts of tracers can be applied in the natural environment. Therefore,
   the cost of tracer experiments could be reduced. The dyes could be
   applied in combined tracer experiments, since both tracers could be
   determined by the same analytical procedure. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to determine whether various sludge types
   (secondary, or aerobically digested), coming from different wastewater
   treatment plants, could be microbially leached to solubilize toxic
   metals and simultaneously digested (SSDML process). Indigenous
   sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms from acclimated sludge were used to
   generate sulfuric acid in situ by the oxidation of added sulfur. The
   experiments were conducted in internal loop tower type reactors (sludge
   volume 10 liters and inoculum volume 1.5 liters) with sulfur spheres of
   25 mm diameter placed at the bottom of each reactor. Results obtained in
   batch experiments in bioreactors using sludges from four different
   wastewater treatment plants (secondary sludge from Sainte Claire (B1),
   secondary sludge from Beauceville (B2), secondary sludge from Black Lake
   (B3) and aerobically digested sludge from Beauceville (B4)), showed that
   the yield of metal solubilization (due to the pH decrease) was not
   affected by the type of sludge processed. The following metal
   solubilization yield was obtained: Cd, 83-100\%; Cr, 34-46\%; Cu,
   61-100\%; Fe, 17-49\%; K, 32-69\%; Mn, 91-100\%; Ni, 57-84\%; P,
   33-69\%; Pb, 17-44\%; Zn, 83-96\%. Cu and Ni, exceeding the norms in the
   fresh sludge, were reduced below the required levels at the end of the
   SSDML process. In conventional aerobic sludge digestion a volatile
   suspended solids reduction of 35\% (B1), 17\% (B2), 29\% (B3) and 24\%
   (B4) was observed in 16 days. An additional reduction of volatile
   suspended solids - 22\% (B1), 23\% (B2), 15\% (B3) and 17\% (B4) - was
   observed after the addition of sulfur spheres and inoculation of
   sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms (the simultaneous sewage sludge
   digestion and metal leaching process) in 27 days. The use of sulfur in
   the form of spheres created anoxic zones in the bioreactor and thus
   favored denitrification (by autotrophic microorganisms and/or by the
   heterotrophs using nitrate as their terminal electron acceptor), leading
   to removal of the nitrates from the sludge. A substantial amount of
   ammonia was solubilized in the leachate produced, but the nitrogen,
   phosphorus and potassium values of the decontaminated sludge solids were
   only marginally affected. The sphere form of sulfur used in the
   experiments facilitated the recovery of unused sulfur at the end of the
   process and thus minimized the potential for sludge re-acidification.

Abstract = {{The aerobic biodegradability of unoxidised and ozonated chloro-, nitro-,
   and amino-phenols was investigated using batch bioassays with
   unacclimated biomass. Chloro- and nitro-phenols exhibited
   biorecalcitrant behavior at 200 mg/liter as GOD, yet were more readily
   degraded at 30 mg/liter as GOD. Ozonation of chloro-and nitro-phenols
   significantly enhanced their biodegradability. While unoxidized
   aminophenols were readily degradable, ozonation significantly decreased
   their biodegradability. Quantitative structure activity relationships
   (QSARs) using Hammett constants were developed for biodegradability of
   unoxidized substituted phenols. For the eight substituted phenols
   studied, ozonation significantly decreased the Microtox toxicity of
   each, with EC50 values increasing from 0.7 to 1.6 orders-of-magnitude.

Abstract = {{Macromolecules can comprise a significant portion of dissolved organic
   carbon in wastewater and affect wastewater treatability by engineered
   systems, but little information is available about mechanisms of
   macromolecule degradation. The release of protein hydrolytic fragments
   was monitored during the degradation of the model protein bovine serum
   albumin (BSA) in batch and continuous suspended cultures and in
   fixed-film reactor systems. Three different inocula that represent a
   range of bacterial diversity were used: a protein degrading isolate, a
   commercial biological oxygen demand (BOD) test inoculum (limited
   diversity culture) and a wastewater inoculum. Molecular size
   distributions were monitored during degradation using membrane
   ultrafiltration techniques. Intermediate-molecular-weight protein
   hydrolytic fragments (2000-10,000 amu) were produced and released into
   solution by all cultures in all reactor types investigated. In batch
   suspended culture reactors with initial BSA concentrations of 100 mg
   liter(-1), maximum concentrations of intermediate-molecular-weight
   hydrolytic fragments of 25, 10 and 6 mg liter(-1) were found,
   respectively, in pure, limited diversity and wastewater cultures. Since
   material in the 2000-10,000 amu fraction decreased as culture diversity
   increased, it was concluded that the involvement of many microbial
   species during protein degradation limits the accumulation of hydrolytic
   fragments under conditions typical of wastewater treatment systems.
   These results lead to the proposal of a protein degradation mechanism
   that features cell-bound hydrolysis of protein and the subsequent
   release of hydrolytic fragments back into bulk solution. Hydrolysis and
   release is repeated by the same or different cells until fragments are
   small enough(< 1000 amu) to be directly assimilated by cells. Because
   the concentration of protein hydrolysis fragments released in
   high-diversity wastewater inoculated reactors was low and they were
   rapidly degraded, the release of hydrolysis fragments should have little
   impact on overall macromolecule degradation kinetics in domestic
   wastewater treatment systems. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{To improve wastewater treatment models, it is important to consider that
   wastewater is composed of a variety of complex molecules, many molecules
   having large molecular weights. Previous experiments have shown that
   hydrolytic enzymes are cell-associated and that hydrolytic fragments
   accumulate in bulk solution during the degradation of a model
   polysaccharide (dextran) in pure culture. These results indicate that
   incompletely hydrolyzed macromolecules are released into solution prior
   to their complete degradation. The authors wanted to determine whether
   the release of incompletely degraded molecules was specific to dextran
   degradation by pure cultures or whether it could be generalized to mixed
   culture systems and the degradation of other polysaccharides. To
   accomplish this, both pure and mixed (wastewater) cultures were used to
   examine the degradation of dextran and another macromolecular
   polysaccharide, dextrin, in batch suspended culture, continuous
   suspended culture and fixed-film reactor systems. Membrane
   ultrafiltration was used to monitor the molecular weight distribution of
   polysaccharides in solution during degradation. In all reactor
   configurations, and for all substrates and inocula investigated,
   small-molecular-weight (< 1000 amu) oligosaccharides accumulated in
   solution during polysaccharide degradation. These results, in
   conjunction with results of enzyme studies, support a generalized model
   for macromolecular degradation by cells that features cell-bound
   hydrolysis of polysaccharides and the subsequent release of hydrolytic
   fragments back into bulk solution. This hydrolysis and release is
   repeated until fragments are small enough(< 1000 amu) to be assimilated
   by cells. Essential features of this model are that polysaccharide
   diffusivity changes during its degradation and that different enzymes,
   with different methods of operation and different kinetic
   characteristics, may be used in successive hydrolytic cleavages. These
   features are particularly important to consider in evaluating
   macromolecule degradation by aggregates and biofilms and in
   understanding overall uptake kinetics in bioreactors. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effluent generated by the Chilean fishmeal industry during hydraulic
   unloading of fish from ships is high in organic load. After recycling
   and primary treatment to remove fats and proteins, the effluent contains
   4-6 kg COD m(-3) and high salt content (an average of 1.85 kg SO4= m(-3)
   and 16.2 kg Clm(-3)). Marine sediments and fresh pig manure were assayed
   as anaerobic inocula to purify this saline effluent. The marine inoculum
   adapted better and faster at 37 degrees C, Showing a higher final
   methanogenic/sulphate-reducing bacteria ratio of 0.0025. Specific
   methanogenic activity at 37 degrees C was 0.065 kg CH4 COD (kg VSS
   day)(-1), corresponding to 1.3 kg COD (kg VSS)(-1) in 20 days. Methane
   production was inhibited at COD/SO4= ratios lower than 0.5. A 50\%
   inhibition of the activity was found at 0.22 kg H2S m(-3), 53 kg
   Na(+)m(-3) and 10 kg SO4= m(-3) respectively; however, at the
   concentration range in the effluent neither was inhibitory. Kinetic
   parameters were obtained at 18 and 37 degrees C in mixed flow reactors.
   At those temperatures, mu(max) values were 0.267 and 0.479 days(-1),
   while K values for the Chen and Hashimoto model were 2.964 and 1.476,
   and the growth yield factor (Y) was 0.19 kg VSS (kg COD)(-1). The
   activation energies were estimated as 3.06 kJ mol(-1) for mu(max) and
   27.51 kJ mol(-1) for K. showing that the saline wastewater treatment has
   a lower temperature dependence than the non-saline one. It was concluded
   that, under these conditions of high organic load, fishery effluent can
   be anaerobically treated. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A plant-based surfactant extracted from fruit pericarps of Sapindus
   mukorossi (Ritha) is proposed for remediation of contaminated soil from
   a local hazardous waste site. Natural surfactants can be prepared using
   a very simple water extraction of fruit pericarp powder. Natural
   surfactant solutions are employed to enhance the aqueous solubility of a
   hydrophobic organic compound, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and to desorb HCB
   from soils in batch and one-dimensional flow-through soil column
   experiments. The solubility of HCB in natural surfactant solutions
   increased linearly with surfactant concentration beyond the critical
   micelle concentration. The mass of dry Ritha powder required to
   solubilize 1 mg of HCB in 1 liter of water was comparable to sodium
   dodecylsulfate solution and other commercial surfactants. HCB
   concentration in the aqueous solutions approached 90\% of the HCB
   solubility in the respective natural surfactant solutions when soils
   contaminated to high levels were used for desorption. HCB recovery was
   up to 90\% of the total HCB for soils contaminated with lower levels.
   Desorption behavior observed for natural surfactant solutions was
   similar to SDS solutions. Natural surfactant solutions performed more
   efficiently than a simple water hood in recovering HCB from
   one-dimensional soil columns. The HCB concentration in the effluent was
   found to be as high as 80\% of the surfactant-enhanced HCB solubility in
   respective solutions. The results of this study provide a strong case
   for pursuing natural surfactant solutions in further research. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{An electric current was passed through a granular activated carbon (GAG)
   column to investigate changes in the surface characteristics of the GAC

   and more acidic after anodic treatment. Oxic and anoxic isotherms were
   compared using statistical methods to evaluate changes in the adsorptive
   capacity of GAC for phenol. Under oxic conditions, the adsorptive
   capacity of GAC decreased after anodic and cathodic treatment. Under
   anoxic conditions, a decrease in adsorptive capacity in the lower range
   of phenol concentrations investigated was observed after anodic
   treatment, while cathodic treatment may not have significantly altered
   the adsorptive capacity. The observed changes in adsorptive capacity
   could not be definitely correlated with the observed changes in the

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2177-2186}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A meso-humic lake was divided into two basins. One basin and its
   catchment area were treated with an acid solution (pH 3.0-3.5), while
   the other served as control. To study the influence of the treatment on
   the physical and chemical properties of surface microlayers (SM),
   samples were taken with a remotely controlled slick collector, fitted
   with a hydrophilic Teflon-coated rotating drum. SM of acid-treated (A)
   and non-treated (B) basins and respective subsurface water (SW) were
   compared to identify possible effects of the acid treatment. The average
   enrichment factor (Er) of particulate organic carbon (POC), i.e. the
   quotient of SM and SW concentrations, was 16 in SM A and 18 in SM B
   during the 1994 investigation. The particulate fraction ( > 0.45 mu m)
   of organic carbon constituted 25-30\% of total organic carbon in SM A
   and 10-15\% in SM B during the study. E-r values of dissolved organic
   carbon (DOG) rarely exceeded 3 and varied little during the day-night
   cycle. UV254 absorbance capacity of SM was 10-15\% lower in the treated
   basin than in the control during the whole study. In 1992, SM B
   contained relatively high amounts of UV-absorbing high-molecular-weight
   (HMW) material, while SM A contained two distinct fractions, one of
   higher and one of lower molecular weight. This coincided with a higher
   biomass of phytoplankton in SM B than in SM A. Acetic acid was the most
   abundant simple organic acid detected in SM and is a common product of
   organic acid degradation. The volatile carboxylic acids (C-2-C-6)
   represented a lower fraction of the DOC than the less volatile fatty
   acids (C-8-C-18). Yet, these compounds contributed less than 1\% of
   total DOG. Protein material, measured as particulate organic nitrogen,
   was greater in SM A than in SM B. Nitrogen fractions, base cations and
   trace metals concentrations in SM A were qualitatively different from SM
   B. This could have been an effect of the treatment, but it was probably
   also related to differences in hydrology and geomorphology in the
   catchment area. The acid treatment of the catchment and lake influenced
   the microlayer properties by increasing particle formation and by acid
   degradation of HMW organic material. The acid degradation resulted in
   reduced UV extinction in the SM of the treated basin. (C) 1997 Elsevier

   time indicated no trends during the study period. Univariate Box-Jenkins
   techniques were used to model the observed patterns in water quality.
   These models were then used to project past patterns and relationships
   into the future (forecasting). These anticipated forecasts may then aid
   in planning and decision making. The sign test was used to confirm that
   no trends were present during the study period. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The response of a glucose-fed anaerobic community to a long-term (> 400
   days) periodic substrate perturbation was examined. A completely mixed
   `'mother'' reactor operated at steady state with a 10-day hydraulic
   retention time (HRT) and constant 8 g/liter glucose feed served as the
   source of organisms for a `'daughter'' reactor. The daughter reactor was
   initially operated in the same manner as the mother reactor, i.e. at a
   10-day HRT and a constant 8 g/liter glucose feed. After reaching steady
   state, the daughter reactor was subjected to a periodic organic loading
   pattern in which the influent glucose concentration was alternately
   varied from 16 to 0 g/liter (mineral media only) on a B-day cycle. A
   rapid accumulation in glucose fermentation intermediates occurred
   immediately after initiating the perturbation. Effluent chemical oxygen
   demand (GOD) increased from ca 400 to a peak level of 6000 mg/liter,
   methane content of the biogas decreased from 50 to less than 20\% and
   the pH decreased from 7.0 to 6.2. This was followed by a 230-day
   metastable `'steady state'' during which the effluent COD concentration
   fluctuated about a new median value of 5000 mg/liter and the acetate and
   butyrate concentrations varied in a cyclic, inverse pattern. At the end
   of the metastable period, volatile fatty acid concentrations decreased
   rapidly. Within ca 40 days, a new steady state was established. There
   observations indicate that the anaerobic system was able to adapt to the
   periodic substrate perturbation through a long-term change in microbial
   community. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{When properly designed, collimators can be used to develop a source of
   electromagnetic radiation which is uniform and easily quantified. A
   collimator design is presented which minimizes reflection and promotes
   the development of a well-behaved, quantifiable radiation source. The
   design of the collimator is optimized by use of a numerical model, line
   source integration (LSI), a continuous version of the widely used
   point-source summation technique. The LSI model is used to quantify the
   radiation intensity field from a collimator which incorporated a
   standard low-pressure mercury are lamp as its source of radiation. A
   method of measuring lamp output power is also demonstrated which employs
   experimental measurements of intensity through a collimator and the LSI
   model. The physical meaning of this measurement, its limitations and

Abstract = {{Radial freezing and vertical freezing of waste activated sludge were
   conducted in this work. In radial freezing, where the sludge sample is
   placed in a cylindrical chamber cooled at its outer wall surface, the
   ice front grows and migrates inwards from the rim region along a radial
   direction. The corresponding freezing speed decreases gradually due to
   the increase in heat conduction resistance through the ice layer. In
   vertical freezing, where the sludge was placed in sample tubes immersed
   vertically into a freezing pool, the ice front grows upwards at a
   constant freezing speed. Comparisons between flee characteristics and
   the changes in chemical compositions resulting from both tests make
   clear the role of freezing speed. That is, if only the developing ice
   front can reject foreign particles and thereby cause the gross migration
   of sludge flocs, the effects on sludge performance would be similar. The
   most influential factor that determines the freeze/thaw-conditioned
   sludge performance is discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Toxity of phenol towards upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB)
   biogranules treating wastewater containing different substrates was
   investigated. Under shock-loading conditions, the specific methanogenic
   activity (SMA) of the biogranules decreased with the increase of phenol
   concentration. The C-1.50 (i.e, the concentration at which bioactivity
   was 50\% of the control) was 1750, 1000 and 1700 mg-phenol litre(-1) for
   acetate-, propionate- and benzoate-degrading biogranules, respectively.
   Under continuous-loading conditions, however, phenol toxicity was not
   progressive. Instead, phenol had a threshold toxicity level for each
   type of biogranules: 1050-1600, >850 and 1100-1700 mg litre(-1) for
   benzoate-, propionate- and acetate-degrading biogranules, respectively.
   Below these threshold levels, phenol was not inhibitive to the activity
   of biogranules; but above them, the inhibition was nearly 100\%. Phenol
   toxicity was neither cumulative nor permanent. Once the phenol
   concentration in wastewater was lowered to levels below the threshold,
   biogranules were able to gradually regain 100\% of their activity.
   Lowering substrate concentration expedited the recovering process. (C)

Abstract = {{The growth and decay of microorganisms in an auto-/heterotrophic biofilm
   were investigated experimentally and by modelling. The long-term study
   (220 days) of the biofilm was based on measurement with microelectrodes
   and enabled the formulation of decay processes for the bacteria
   considered. The oxygen demand and, with it, the activity of the bacteria
   during a phase without substrate feeding were demonstrated by measuring
   the oxygen concentration in the diffusion field of the boundary layer
   above the biofilm by means of an oxygen microelectrode. For autotrophic
   bacteria, the formulation of the processes of death and endogenous
   respiration by a first-order reaction is sufficient to describe the loss
   of active bacteria in a biofilm. When modelling a biofilm with
   heterotrophic bacteria, the processes of growth and decay have to be
   described in more detail. In order to achieve an agreement between the
   model and the experimental results, the process of maintenance as well
   as the process of lysis of the heterotrophic bacteria must be
   considered. The interaction among the bacteria involved and their
   competition for existence in the biofilm have been worked out during the
   transition from a heterotrophic to an auto-/heterotrophic biofilm. (C)

Abstract = {{It is hypothesised that, since precipitation chemistry regulates the
   constitution of the base cations occupying the cation exchange sites of
   peat soils, and the latter in turn directly regulates the relative
   abundance of the corresponding base cations in drainage waters, the
   ratios of base cations in precipitation and drainage waters from peats
   should be very similar. The hypothesis is confirmed using data for 45
   streams in western Scotland sampled under baseflow conditions, and for
   three streams in northeastern Scotland sampled along their length under
   baseflow conditions and also throughout a sequence of three successive
   storms. During the latter, as the soils became progressively wetter, and
   flow through or over surface organic horizons started to make an
   increasing relative contribution to total discharge, the difference
   between cation ratios in precipitation and river water was reduced. The
   effects of changing hydrological pathway in the three catchments were
   confirmed by changes in Al:Ca:Mg ratios between baseflow and storm water
   samples. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The results of phosphate coprecipitation on calcite, occurring in a
   solution of calcium bicarbonate, in the presence of photosynthesizing
   algae are presented. The precipitation experiments were carried out at
   20 degrees C in an illuminated culture apparatus with continuous
   recordings of pH and conductivity. The alga used in the experiment was
   the unicellular green alga Chlorococcum sp. The results are analysed
   using chemical kinetic models and are compared to phosphate
   coprecipitation occurring in abiotic conditions. The calculated values
   of the maximum surface density of coprecipitated phosphate are in good
   agreement with those from abiotic conditions, which indicates that the
   same mechanism is in operation. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A severe red-tide bloom of Chattonella antiqua (Raphidophyceae) was
   observed in the Seto Inland Sea (Japan) in summer 1987. The C. antiqua
   bloom was monitored from beginning to end at the 0, 5, 10, 15m and
   bottom layers of a fixed sampling station almost every two days.
   Carotenoids and chlorophyllous pigments were measured by reversed-phase
   high-performance liquid chromatography before and during the bloom.
   Before the C. antiqua bloom, some diatoms were dominant, with a
   chlorophyll a (Chla) concentration ranging between 2 and 8 mu g
   litre(-1) at the surface. The maximum Chla concentration reached 27 pg
   litre(-1) at the surface during the bloom, this being due to C. antiqua.
   Violaxanthin. which is a constituent carotenoid of C. antiqua, varied in
   line with cell concentration of the species. The relative abundance of
   C. antiqua was estimated as its Chla contribution to total Chla; the
   Chla contributions of Raphidophyceae, Bacillariophyceae and Dinophyceae
   were calculated from pigment ratios obtained by multiple regression
   analysis of pigment concentrations. The relative abundance of C. antiqua
   at the surface was calculated to be 0-16\% before the bloom and 83-100\%
   during the bloom. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2278-2286}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Tight control of activated sludge processes is hampered by the lack of
   reliable information about important process characteristics. Some of
   those important characteristics are sludge kinetics, short-term
   biochemical oxygen demand (BODst) and respiration rate in the aeration
   tank, Spanjers et al. (1994) developed a technique to estimate those
   characteristics from data collected from a continuously fed respirometer
   with a specially developed operation strategy. Essential in their
   estimation technique is the instable backward integration of a forwardly
   stable differential equation. In this paper, an improved on-lint
   implementable estimation methodology is presented. The estimation
   problem is formulated as a non-linear optimization problem, avoiding
   backward integration and estimating the respirometer flow. This novel
   methodology has been applied to the data set of Spanjers ct ol, (1994),
   and the resulting estimates turn out to be comparable. But, contrary to
   expectation, the estimates still suffer from unacceptable inaccuracy due
   to large parameter correlation. However, a slight modification in the
   measurement strategy is proposed which will eliminate the problem of
   parameter correlation to a large extent and so enable more accurate
   estimation, The new measurement strategy is only advantageous when
   combined with the novel estimation methodology presented in this paper.

Abstract = {{The importance of fine fractions of aquifer sediment was investigated
   with respect to microbial degradation capacity, as quantified in terms
   of number of organic compounds degraded and degradation rates. The
   degradation capacity was investigated for two aquifers in aerobic
   laboratory batch incubations with a mixture of eight aromatic
   hydrocarbons, benzene, toluene, o-xylene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene,
   1,4-dichlorobenzene naphthalene, biphenyl and nitrobenzene. The
   degradation capacity of suspensions of fines in groundwater and
   suspensions of complete sediment in groundwater were very similar,
   although not identical. Comparison of suspensions of autoclaved fines
   with suspensions of non-autoclaved fines showed that the degradation
   rates were only slightly lower in the suspension with autoclaved fines,
   but the lag-phases were distinctly prolonged, and thus the fines acted
   as an inoculum. However, an increase in bacterial numbers (enumerated by
   plate counting) and a substantial number of bacteria in the fines phase
   at the end of the experiment clearly showed that the autoclaved fines
   were colonized during the incubation and thus also acted as biomass
   support material. This indicates that a part of a bacteria able to
   degrade the investigated readily degradable and dissolvable compounds
   occurred freely suspended in the water. Diluting the suspensions of
   fines (five or ten times) did not influence the degradation capacity
   seriously, but it increased the difference between autoclaved and
   non-autoclaved fines, since the degradation rates decreased in the
   suspensions of autoclaved fines, especially for the more sorbing
   compounds naphthalene and biphenyl, where lag-phases were also observed.
   This indicates that, below a certain lower level of area of solids per
   litre water, the fines were unable to sustain the degrading bacterial
   population. The paper discusses the practical implication of the
   obtained results for conducting and improving laboratory degradation
   experiments representing aquifers (e.g. deep wells) from where solids
   are difficult to obtain. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In wastewater treatment plants with enhanced biological phosphorus
   removal, recycle phosphorus loads from sludge digestion have to be
   considered. Dissolved phosphorus from polyphosphate hydrolysis and
   degradation of organic solids is partly precipitated and adsorbed during
   sludge stabilization. Calcium inns and magnesium ions as well as
   aluminosilicates (zeolite A) from detergents art mainly. involved in
   these processes. Experiments in a laboratory digester with pure excess
   sludge and mixed sludge show the extent of the fixation and indicate
   that recycle loads ate minimized at a level of below 10\%, if primary
   sludge is present. Even the use of prefermented primary sludge did not
   significantly influence this fraction. In stabilization of pure excess
   sludge, the dissolved phosphorus fraction comes to 20-25\%. A
   mathematical model is presented which combines the involved processes of
   phosphorus release and refixation. The availability of calcium for
   precipitation processes is an influential parameter and may change under
   different wastewater conditions (hardness, zeolite content) and
   operation modes of the activated sludge plant (sludge age). Iron is only
   available for phosphorus precipitation in digestion after deducting the
   amount needed for the fixation of sulphur. The model allows the
   prediction of phosphorus recycling under different operation conditions
   and the comparison of process alternatives, For this purpose it is
   necessary to have detailed information about the fresh sludge
   composition with emphasis on the content of polyphosphate and inorganic
   phosphorus in the excess sludge. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Acetate fermentation in anaerobic filters was performed to study the
   deep-biofilm kinetics of substrate utilization. Small Peclet number
   ranging from 0.01 to 1.5 found in the tracer test indicates that the
   flow regime in anaerobic filters is close to complete-mix. An axial
   dispersion model coupled with deep-biofilm kinetics is simulated along
   the biofilter height. A good agreement between the calculated and
   experimental results indicates that the proposed deep-biofilm model can
   be used to estimate the removal efficiency of the readily degradable
   substrate in anaerobic filters if the ratio of voidage to specific
   surface area is greater than several millimeters. Also, a higher
   influent substrate concentration gives a higher substrate removal
   efficiency if the surface loading is kept the same. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This work was designed to study the transition from water treated with
   O-3 and granular activated carbon to nanofiltered water with special
   regard to biofilm sloughing and turbidity, and to measure the extent of
   biofouling in an `'old'' network fed with non-chlorinated nanofiltered
   water. The experimental drinking water distribution system contained six
   loops in series, with a total hydraulic residence time (HRT) of 72 h. II
   was first fed with biologically treated water (GAG water) having organic
   carbon (1.6 mg-C litre(-1), of which 22\% was biodegradable) and
   microorganisms (1.12 x 10(5) cells ml(-1), of which 7\% was culturable
   after 15 days of incubation). It was then fed with nanofiltered water,
   which was contaminated with bacteria in transit from the nanofiltration
   unit to the network. This nanofiltered water 1 contained 0.23 mg-C
   litre(-1) (biodegradable fraction < 0.1 mg-C litre(-1)) and 3.0 x 10(4)
   cells ml(-1) (22\% was culturable after 15 days). Finally, the system
   was fed with nanofiltered water 2 that contained few microorganisms (50
   cells ml(-1)) and few nutrients (0.21 mg-C litre(-1), biodegradable
   fraction <0.1 mg-C litre(-1)). The changes in the water and biofilm
   quality in the experimental network fed successively with the three
   waters, and the water quality during transport through the network, were
   determined. The bacterial population in the system showed a gradual drop
   in the total number of cells and their culturability with the water
   changes. The total number of cells and the colony forming units (CFU)
   after 3-15 days decreased respectively about 10-fold and 100-fold after
   1 year of feeding with nanofiltered water 2 compared to GAC water to
   reach 1.3 x 10(4) cells ml(-1), 2 CFU ml(-1) (after 3 days of incubation
   at 22 degrees C) and 121 CFU ml(-1) (after 15 days of incubation at 22
   degrees C) in the first loop of the experimental network (HRT 12 h). No
   massive biofilm sloughing was observed. The quality of nanofiltered
   water 2 changed during its transport through the network (total HRT of
   the water 72 h) with immediate bacterial contamination, But the total
   number of cells increased slowly and reached 1.4 x 10(5) cells ml(-1) at
   the end of the system. The number of culturable bacteria decreased
   slowly and regularly as a function of the HRT to reach 8 CFU (3 days)
   ml(-1) and 260 CFU (15 days) ml(-1) at the end of the network. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Biosorption of Cu2+ by Sargassum fluitans seaweed biomass protonated by
   an acidic wash or loaded with Ca2+ is based on ion exchange. The uptake
   of Cu2+ is respectively accompanied by a release of either H+ or Ca2+
   into the solution phase. The effects of Ca-, H- and H/Ca-cycles on the
   performance of a continuous-flow biosorption fixed-bed were established.
   The Ca-cycle applied to Sargassum biomass in a packed bed led to a high
   degree of a column utilization but did not allow an effective Cu
   recovery. The H-cycle permitted 100\% Cu recovery but also shortened the
   sorption column service time. The combined Ca/H-cycle was shown to be
   inefficient due to the time consuming regeneration of biomass from the
   H-form to the Ca-form. Biomass pretreatment with 1\% (w) solution of
   CaCl2 and with 0.1 ha HCl resulted in the same Cu uptake of 75 mg/g. The
   Ca-pretreated biomass lost approximately 30\% of its Cu capacity with
   subsequent acidic wash. The equilibrium aspects of Cu removal and
   recovery in a biosorption column were analyzed through the concept of
   ion-exchange isotherms. The dynamics of Cu sorption and of biomass
   regeneration in a fixed-bed column was predicted by numerically solving
   the equations of a proposed ion-exchange model. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In water treatment processes. raw-water colour is a key parameter for
   process control and monitoring. Therefore, the ability to predict the
   raw-water colour is desired to aid in the optimization of the treatment
   process. However. due to the high variance and the inherent non-linear
   relationship of the raw-water colour time series, it is difficult to
   produce a reliable model with conventional modeling approaches. In this
   paper, the artificial neural network (ANN) modeling technique is used to
   establish a model for forecasting the raw-water colouring in a large
   river. A general ANN modeling scheme is also recommended for the rest of
   the raw-water parameters. The modeling process typically includes four
   stags: source data analysis, system priming, system fine-tuning and
   model evaluation. Some optimization issues involved in the modeling
   phases and the potential applications of ANN in the water treatment
   industry are also discussed. Results indicate that the ANN modeling
   scheme shows much promise for water quality modeling and process control
   in water treatment. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The possibility of nitrifying municipal landfill leachate using
   suspended-carrier biofilm technology was studied in three
   laboratory-scale reactors filled with three different types of carrier
   media. The effects of the temperature and the hydraulic retention time
   (HRT) on the volumetric nitrification rate were investigated.
   Steady-state nitrification rates were obtained in the processes after
   approximately 1 month of operation. The nitrification rate showed a
   rather weak dependence on the temperature, the rate at 5 degrees C being
   approximately 77\% of the rate at 20 degrees C. The HRT had a more
   pronounced effect on the rate of nitrification, shoeing a considerable
   increase in nitrification rate with a decreased HRT. The highest
   efficiency was achieved for a carrier media consisting of small cubes of
   macroporous cellulose. A maximum nitrification rate of 40 g
   (NH4+-N)/(m(3) reactor h) was obtained by use of this carrier at 20
   degrees C, an HRT of 14 h and a carrier filling degree of 10\% of the

Abstract = {{A thermal detection technique, which is based on monitoring the effects
   of a partial desorption of adsorbed material resulting from an applied
   heat pulse, has been used to follow the adsorption of phenoxyacid
   herbicides (MCPA, MCPP, and MCPB) on a carbon packed column. Results
   obtained show that this approach allows effective prediction of single
   component breakthrough using a single-sensor configuration and an
   artificial neural network for signal interpretation. However, the
   integration of a multiple-sensor array using a modified neural network
   was found to give improved performance. Although this work has focused
   mainly on single-solute systems, preliminary results are presented which
   demonstrate the potential for monitoring binary-solute loadings. (C)

Abstract = {{Irgarol 1051,
   2-methylthio-4-tert-butylamino-6-cyclopropylamino-s-triazine, is a newly
   developed herbicidal additive for use in copper-based antifouling
   paints. It is intended to replace the antifouling agent tributyltin,
   which has been regulated internationally due to its severe impact on the
   aquatic ecosystem. However, there is no information in the open
   literature on the persistence and degradation of Irgarol, a fact that
   hinders the assessment of its ultimate impact on the environment. This
   study showed that the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium was
   capable of biotransforming Irgarol 1051. It appears that the metabolism
   of Irgarol by the fungus proceeds mainly via partial N-dealkylation.
   Metabolic dealkylation occurs at the cyclopropylamino group resulting in
   metabolite M1, which has tentatively been identified as
   2-methylthio-4-tert-butylamino-6-amino-s-triazine. M1 appeared to be a
   stable and/or terminal metabolite. No evidence of the heterocyclic ring
   cleavage of Irgarol 1051 was observed, thus implying a possibility of
   its degradation product(s) accumulating in the environment. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The dissolution behaviour of ferrihydrite and ferrihydrite incorporating
   arsenate at different levels was investigated under low pH, oxic
   conditions. The dissolution of pure ferrihydrite was found to be well
   described by the cube root law for mineral dissolution. The rate of
   dissolution of ferrihydrite precipitated in the presence of selected
   levels of arsenate was strongly retarded by the presence of the
   arsenate, The surface coordinative chemical model of mineral dissolution
   was applied to interpret and quantify proton dissolution rates of
   ferrihydrite and the inhibitory effect of arsenate. The inhibitory
   effect of the arsenate appears to be related to its complexation with
   the ferrihydrite surface and the consequent involvement of the surface
   iron centres in competitive equilibria between protons and the
   surface-complexed arsenate. From the iron:arsenic ratios obtained during
   dissolution, it has been concluded that arsenic is incorporated into
   these precipitates by sorption onto existing surfaces of the
   ferrihydrite during precipitation, rather than by the formation of a
   solid solution or by co-deposition. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A fluidized-bed bioreactor (FEB) containing Methylocystis sp. strain M
   (strain M) isolated from Japanese soil was developed for treating
   synthetic groundwater containing trichloroethylene (TCE). Strain M
   bacteria were immobilized in 2\% calcium alginate gel beads and
   introduced into the reactor, which was supplied with a methane/air gas
   mixture. TCE concentrations in the reactor were reduced from 0.9-1.6 to
   0.1-0.2 mg/litre after a residence time of 2.56 h. Thus, 80-90\% of the
   influent TCE was degraded in the reactor, and the resulting effluent gas
   contained only 0.02-0.04 mg/litre TCE. The ability of the
   gel-immobilized cells to degrade TCE declined rapidly during the TCE
   degradation process. To compensate for this decrease in activity, the
   reactor was operated for TCE degradation and reactivation of the
   immobilized strain M cells on alternate days. TCE degradation activity
   was completely recovered within 24 h after supplying a methane/air
   mixture (2:8 v/v) and a mineral salt solution to the bacteria. The
   degradation capacity of the reactor was kept in a steady state for 10
   days in this way, but the rate of recovery of TCE degradation activity
   gradually decreased. TCE degradation activity fell from 6.0 litres/g dry
   weight (gdw) per hour on the sixth day to 1.4 litres/gdw per hour on the
   24th day. Interestingly, there was no corresponding decrease in methane
   consumption by the bacteria. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results obtained from oxidation with O-3 and
   O-3/H2O2 of a residual water coming from the production of dicofol and
   tetradifon pesticides, where chlorobenzenes, DDTs and its metabolites
   and other organochloride compounds were found. The oxidation processes
   were carried out using ozone (O-3) in basic medium (pH 9.4) at low
   dosage (0-1.5 g O-3 g(-1) initial TOC) and in the presence of hydrogen
   peroxide (H2O2), with a 0.5 H2O2/O-3 molar ratio. During the treatment,
   many compounds were removed (dichlorobenzophenone, tetradifon,
   chlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene) and their change in concentration at
   different ozonation contact time was monitored. Other compounds like DDE
   remained practically invariable. This study investigated the formation
   of first ozonation by-products (FOBPs) in the wastewater, specifically
   chlorophenols, by means of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
   and gas chromatography/electron capture detection (GC/ECD) analysis in
   terms of the amount of time the O-3 has been in contact with the
   processed sample. o-Chlorophenol, p-chlorophenol, benzenemethanol,
   n-chlorohydroxibenzaldehyde, n-chlorobenzenemethanol, chlorobenzoic
   acid, etc., were formed during the treatment, due to the mechanism of
   fast and non-selective oxidation which ozone has through OH radicals,
   formed by the decomposition of the O-3 molecule and accelerated by the
   presence of H2O2 in water. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   by analysing field samples with the methods described are summarized.
   The main sources and the input pathways by which the volatiles enter the
   marine environment are presented. Removal mechanisms like degradation
   and exchange with other environmental compartments, especially the
   atmosphere, are briefly discussed. Sampling systems and analytical
   techniques are reviewed. Aspects like contamination generated by the
   sampling materials or treatment and storage of the samples until
   analysis are discussed. The performance of preconcentration techniques
   such as liquid extraction, purge-and-trap and other (less often used)
   techniques are compared. Details on the analyses sensu strictu
   (separation, detection, limits of detection and reproducibility) are
   given. Finally, results of measurements of these compounds in estuaries,
   beach waters, bays, fjords, coastal and shelf sea waters and open seas
   are presented. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The AGNPS model was used to assess the impact of management practices on
   the water quantity and quality from Owl Run, a 1153-ha watershed in the
   Piedmont Region of Virginia. Prior to this assessment, the model was
   calibrated using 2 years of hydrologic and water-quality data from the
   same watershed. It was concluded that the model is applicable to
   nonpoint source (NPS) impact assessment for watersheds similar to Owl
   Run. Better agreement was found between simulated and observed runoff
   volumes than between simulated and observed peak rates, sediment or
   nutrient yields. An annualization procedure, based on frequency analyses
   of storms and rainfall erosivity factors, and the joint probabilities of
   occurrence at different crop stages, were used to estimate annual
   average NPS loadings. The results were found to be close to average
   observed values for the watershed. The model was also used to simulate
   the effects of the application of seven different best management
   practice (BMP) scenarios on the watershed. The reduction rates in
   simulated pollutant loadings and the costs for BMP implementation were
   used to identify appropriate BMPs for the watershed. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Whole-cell and cell-extract assays of a wastewater methanogenic
   consortium and cell extracts of Methanosarcina barkeri strain MS were
   shown to dechlorinate chloroform (CF), predominantly to dichloromethane
   (DCM). The wastewater cell dechlorination reaction was supported by
   electron donors like methanol, acetate, butyrate, but dechlorination
   rates in the presence of glucose were 5-fold less. Methanogenesis in
   wastewater samples was almost completely inhibited (reversibly) by as
   little as 71 nM (8.5 ppb) aqueous CF, but DCM was only slightly
   inhibitory at 107 mu M (9.1 ppm) levels. The eubacterial antibiotics,
   ampicillin and streptomycin, inhibited approximately 40\% of the
   dechlorination activity in the wastewater sample and the methanogenesis
   inhibitor bromoethanesulfonic acid (BES) inhibited 90\% of the
   dechlorination. CF dechlorination rates were similar in cell extracts of
   M. barkeri (222 nmol CF/min/mg protein) and a wastewater enrichment
   culture (177 nmol CF/min/mg protein). BES inhibited 41\% of the CF
   dechlorination in cell extracts of M. barkeri and 34\% of the activity
   in the wastewater culture extracts. Coenzyme M significantly reversed
   the BES inhibition of both methanogenesis and CF dechlorination by whole
   cells of the wastewater culture, bur had no effect on cell-free extract
   dechlorination. Boiled cell-free extracts had dechlorination rates that
   were 15 and 22\% higher compared to unboiled rates in extracts from the
   wastewater culture and M. barkeri, respectively. On the basis of these
   studies, it is proposed that CF dechlorination in this wastewater sample
   is mediated by the same catalysts found in M, barkeri and that these
   heat-stable catalysts are functional in both the free and protein-bound
   forms. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Samples of raw and treated wastewater were collected at the Montreal
   Urban Community (Canada) sewage treatment plant between July and October
   1993 and analysed for PCBs and PAHs. Water samples were also collected
   in the effluent plume in the St Lawrence River during the same period.
   The average concentrations of Sigma 13 PCBs in raw wastewater and
   treated wastewater were 4.3 and 1.4 ng/l, respectively. For PAHs,
   average concentrations in raw wastewater and treated wastewater were 1.5
   and 0.4 mu g/l, respectively. The removal rates for PCB congeners and
   individual PAHs ranged from 33 to 100\%. Approximately 1 kg of PCBs and
   0.26 tonnes of PAHs were discharged annually by the MUC wastewater
   treatment plant to the St Lawrence River. Levels of PCBs and PAHs
   increased significantly at the effluent outfall in the river compared to
   those measured at the upstream site. In the effluent plume,
   concentrations of PCBs and PAHs reached background levels at
   approximately 13 and 6 km downstream from the effluent outfall,
   respectively. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In a methanol-fed post-denitrification biofilm system, the density and
   structure of the denitrifying bacterial community were investigated.
   Denitrification was operated in a sand filter succeeding a municipal
   two-stage wastewater treatment with full nitrification. The quantitative
   and qualitative analysis of the community structure revealed distinct
   taxonomic groups to be involved in denitrification. Autecological data
   on these bacteria indicate potential roles in the filter system which
   help to control operation. Members of the genera Hydrogenophaga and
   Comamonas of the beta-subclass of Proteobacteria seem to proliferate at
   both aerobic and anoxic conditions with non-Cl-carbon sources being
   available, i.e. in the upper layers of the filter bed with biomass being
   washed in from the secondary clarifiers. It is likely that a high number
   of the beta-subclass bacteria is washed in and does not belong to the
   autochthonous flora of the denitrifying biofilms. In contrast, members
   of the genus Paracoccus of the alpha-subclass are likely to constitute
   an important part of the autochthonous denitrifiers. They seem to be
   favoured at aerobic conditions with Cl-sources being available, as is
   the case in the surface layers of the biofilms. Moreover, methylotrophic
   members of the genus Hyphomicrobium are supposed to belong to the
   autochthonous flora. They are favoured by anoxic conditions and,
   therefore, are supposed to proliferate throughout the biofilms. The
   assumptions are verified by in-situ hybridization techniques. Both
   paracocci and hyphomicrobia are sensitive to pH drops in the filter bed,
   e.g. by acid production in thick biofilms, which should strictly be
   avoided. For details on physico-chemical and biomass parameters of the
   filter cells in situ see Part 1. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   tested. Results indicated that total mineralization can be achieved
   after 15 h of irradiation. This method is a low-cost process and plates

Abstract = {{The conventional bacterial quantitative and qualitative methods are
   complex and require a lot of skills and time. Therefore a rapid
   microorganism detection system (RMDS) method was developed. With this
   method, yeast cells can be detected without cultivation, while some
   other microorganisms can be often detected after only 4-5 h of
   cultivation. The food sample is placed on a special membrane filter and
   cultivated on a plate until a sufficient amount of ATP is obtained. The
   membrane filter containing the microorganisms is then sprayed with the
   extractive and luminescent reagents and luciferin-luciferase reacts with
   the living cells. By this method, only the bioluminescent living cells
   are detected as spots. Thus, the RMDS method can detect the number but
   not the type of bacteria. An attempt to develop a method for the
   identification of coliforms, which is an index bacteria in food hygiene
   inspection, was made. In order to inhibit the growth of microorganisms
   which are closely related to the Pseudomonas genus and which form red
   colonies similar to coliforms as well as the germination of fungi
   spores, they were cultivated under anaerobic conditions in a new
   selective medium. Typical microorganisms which are often detected in
   foods, including yeasts, fungi, Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative
   bacteria (containing coliforms) and bacterial spores, were used. The
   sample was cultivated in an anaerobic L-shaped test-tube using the new
   coliform selective medium and then detected by the RMDS method. The
   results show that under this condition, the growth of both Pseudomonas
   sp. and fungi are suppressed, and coliforms could be detected within 6-7
   h. This method is more rapid than the conventional method and has great
   potential for practical hygiene testing of both food beverages and
   water. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The thermophilic and mesophilic digestion of instant-coffee-production
   wastewater in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors with
   thermophilic pre-acidification was studied over a period of more than
   120 days. The UASB reactors had been seeded with granules adapted to
   this wastewater, and they previously operated in single-stage mode
   mesophilically or thermophilically. The thermophilic pre-acidification
   stage was operated with pH control or with 1.5 g l(-1) NaHCO3 added to
   the feed, at retention times of 24, 18, 15 and 12 h. Up to 38\% of the
   total influent chemical oxygen demand (GOD) was converted to total
   volatile fatty acids at a 24-h hydraulic retention time (HRT), dropping
   to 21\% at a 12-h HRT. It was found that control with NaOH to pH 6.0 at
   an HRT of 24 h was not required for efficient acidogenesis. The effluent
   from the acidogenic stage at pH 5.2 did not require prior neutralisation
   with NaOH before feeding to the methanogenic stage. The absence of
   neutralisation improved the performance of the thermophilic UASB
   reactor. Thermophilic digestion may be more sensitive to Na+ toxicity
   than mesophilic digestion. The thermophilic/mesophilic two-stage system
   gave a consistent improvement in performance (measured, for example, as
   \% COD reduction) over the thermophilic/thermophilic two-stage system,
   especially at higher organic loading rates. Thermophilic
   pre-acidification gave an increase of 60\% in the loading rate
   achievable with the mesophilic methanogenic stage (a 100\% reduction in
   HRT) compared with the single-stage system. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The adsorption of mono-phosphate ions from aqueous solutions by flocs
   formed upon hydrolysis of alum (Al-2(SO4)(3)) and a basic alum
   (poly-aluminium-silicate-sulphate {[}PASS]) was investigated as a
   function of pH (5-7), phosphate concentration (0-0.53 mM or 0-50 ppm)
   and coagulant concentration. The PO4 adsorption processes were examined
   - first, on pre-formed Aocs of alum or PASS and, second, upon in-situ
   flee formation, e.g. hydrolysis and flocculation in the presence of PO4
   ions. The PO4 adsorption data, together with zeta-potential results,
   show that the PO4-floc interactions on pre-formed flocs involve mainly
   specific interactions accompanied by H+ or OH- exchange; with in-situ
   hydrolysis. complexation and charge neutralization effects play a
   significant part. On pre-formed flocs, PO4 binding does not distinguish
   between alum and PASS. Upon in-situ hydrolysis and coagulation, PASS
   flee binds less PO4 than alum floc, due to the higher cationic charge of
   the latter; however, PASS yields a flee which is larger and more
   resistant to shear stress than the flee obtained with alum, particularly
   at low pH. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of repeated alternating aerobic-anaerobic growth
   conditions on the development of stable denitrification activity was
   studied with continuous cultures of Paracoccus denitrificans and with
   activated sludge. Denitrification activity was determined by measuring
   the formation of intermediates and by analysis of mRNAs for the
   individual dentrification enzymes. Primarily, the length of the
   anaerobic period influenced the synthesis of the denitrification enzymes
   of P. denitrificans. When the anaerobic period was 24 h, the cultures
   reached stable denitrification activity within the first anaerobic
   phase. Then, dinitrogen was the only denitrification product released.
   In contrast, when the anaerobic periods were short (1.5 h), P.
   denitrificans was not able to completely synthesize a stable
   denitrifying enzyme system within the course of the experiment, and a
   semi-steady stale was reached. Nitrite accumulated in the medium as the
   predominant denitrification product. The transient characteristics of
   the activated sludge during the repeated aerobic-anaerobic conditions
   were similar to those observed with P. denitrificans. This finding
   indicates that information on the induction process of denitrification
   in P. denitrificans can be used reasonably well to assess induction of
   denitrifying activity in more complex systems. Finally, the usefulness
   of the application of mRNA probes are discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Many concentrated wastewater streams produced in food and agro-industry
   are treated using sludge digestion. The effluent from sludge digesters
   frequently contains ammonium in high concentrations (up to 2 kg m(-3)).
   This ammonium-rich effluent is usually treated by a normal wastewater
   treatment plant (WWTP). When ammonium removal from this concentrated
   stream is considered, steam stripping or a combination of two biological
   processes, aerobic nitrification and anoxic denitrification, are the
   (costly) options. Recently a novel process was discovered in which
   ammonium is converted to dinitrogen gas under anoxic conditions with
   nitrite as the electron acceptor. It has been named Anammox (anaerobic
   ammonium oxidation). The aim of this study was to demonstrate the
   feasibility of ammonium removal from sludge digestion effluents with the
   Anammox process. Using a synthetic wastewater, it was shown that a
   fixed-bed reactor and a fluidised-bed reactor were suitable reactor
   configurations. The effects of sludge digestion effluent on the Anammox
   process were investigated; during 150 days, 82\% ammonium removal
   efficiency and 99\% nitrite removal efficiency was achieved in a
   fluidised-bed reactor inoculated with Anammox sludge and fed with sludge
   digestion effluent from a domestic WWTP. The maximum nitrogen conversion
   capacity was 0.7 kg NH4+-N m(reactor)(-3) day(-1) and 1.5 kg total N
   m(reactor)(-3) day(-1). (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of dynamic membrane formation on the performance of crossflow
   microfiltration in treating domestic wastewater was investigated. The

   concentrations. Secondary effluent from a domestic wastewater treatment
   plant was used thoughout the study. The MnO2 dynamic membrane was found
   to improve the performance of crossflow microfiltration by producing
   higher flux values, extending the running time, and increasing rejection
   of solids. The optimum permeate flux values were obtained when the
   dynamic membrane was formed at a pH of 10 and using 100 mg/l of KMnO4.
   At optimum conditions, the permeate turbidity was found to stabilize at
   values of less than 0.2 NTU. Cleaning the membrane was achieved easily
   and efficiently by brushing the outside surface of the primary membrane.

Abstract = {{Forty samples of sea and estuary water were collected from a 40 km strip
   along the Adriatic coast of Italy between June 1994 and September 1995.
   Each sample consisted of 101 of water. Routine bacteriological analyses
   were carried out and viral particles concentrated on cross-few
   membranes: the concentrated water samples, equally divided into two
   parts, were used to infect both BGM and Hep-2 cells. Lysates from all
   cell cultures were further tested for the presence of enteroviruses by
   reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and reoviruses by
   polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).
   The results showed widespread viral contamination of the waters tested,
   particularly in late summer. Under our experimental conditions, BGM
   cells were more efficient than Hep-2 in recovering viruses. In fact.
   enteroviruses were detected in up to 33\% and reoviruses in 80\% of BGM
   infected with seawater, compared to 8\% and 53\%, respectively, for the
   Hep-2 cells. In estuarine samples, enteroviruses were detected in 30\%
   and reovirus in 54\% of BGM, compared to 23\% and 30\% of Hep-2. Twenty
   nine out of 40 samples showed the presence of infectious particles on
   the basis of the CPE appearance; after identification of the isolated
   viruses, only 13 turned out to be specifically contaminated by
   enteroviruses. Of the latter, five a ere below the bacteriological
   standards set by the Italian legislation in line with the EEC Directive
   76/160 IEEC for bathing waters. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of the oxidation of various carcinogenic aromatic amines
   by Fenton's reagent {[}Fe(II) + H2O2] for liquid waste treatments was
   assessed. The insoluble products yielded were amenable to oxidation to
   ring-cleavage products and ultimately to carbon dioxide. Mineralization
   was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The kinetics of precipitation was
   determined from scattering measurements, at 500 nm, of the insoluble
   substance produced as a function of time. The influence of experimental
   variables on the removal of aromatic amines from aqueous solutions by
   formation of insoluble products and ring-cleavage products was
   established. Complete removal took about 1 and 3 h of treatment overall
   for the formation of insoluble products and ring-cleavage products,
   respectively. Residual hydrogen peroxide, iron(II) concentration,
   chemical oxygen demand and chromatographic techniques were used to
   determine when the reaction was finished. The iron(II) concentration was
   found to be crucial to the nature of the end products obtained
   (insoluble products, ring-cleavage products, CO2). (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Amongst the methods for the purification of vinasse, anaerobic digestion
   features some advantages that make it particularly suitable for
   processing this type of waste. However, its efficiency is somewhat
   decreased by the presence of phenol compounds. The prior removal of
   these compounds make the vinasse more amenable to anaerobic digestion. A
   possibility of reducing the phenolic content is through an aerobic
   biological pretreatment by some Fungi. So, in the framework of broader
   research directed towards the purification of vinasse by two-stage
   treatment (an aerobic fermentation followed by an anaerobic digestion),
   this work studies exclusively the aerobic stage of Aspergillus terreus
   and Geotrichum candidum. The study is aimed at finding the most suitable
   microorganism for removing phenolic compounds. The fermentations follow
   Monod kinetics. The mathematical model is used in order to compare the
   microorganisms behaviour, and it allows the prediction of the removal of
   phenols. The extent of removal, in the fermentation by A. terreus, of
   total phenols and o-diphenols was c. 66 and 94\%, respectively; in the
   case of G. candidum, the results were c. 70 and 91\%. For A. terreus,
   the maximum specific growth rate is mu(max) = 0.06 h(-1), the constant
   K-s = 13,525 mg COD 1(-1), the growth yield is Y-X/S = 0.38 mg cells per
   mg COD and the efficiency on degrading phenolic compounds is E = 0.033
   mg total phenols per mg cells. For G. candidum, these constants are
   mu(max)' = 0.047 h(-1), K-s' = 4558 mg COD 1(-1), Y-X/S' = 0.39 mg cells
   per mg COD and E' = 0.036 mg total phenols per mg cells. Though both
   microorganisms behave in a similar way, G. candidum seems to be slightly
   better for removing phenols from vinasse. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The biodegradable constituents in wastewater are parameterized by the
   biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) values. The technology based on
   fluorescence detection for the real-time, non-invasive monitoring of the
   biodegradable constituents of various sewage samples is investigated and
   the advantages over current methods (BOD, TOC, COD and absorption at 254
   nm) are discussed, Fluorescence properties of industrial and domestic
   seu age were examined, The spectral signatures (bath absorption and
   fluorescence) of settled sewage samples collected as 24-h composites
   from three different treatment works were found to be similar, hating an
   absorption band at around 280 nm and a fluorescence maximum at 340 nm
   (using 280 nm excitation). The UV-absorbance (ABS) and the peak
   fluorescence (FL) intensities were found to be much lower than those for
   corresponding samples of treated effluent, indicating the extent of
   biodegradation in the processing of raw sewage. To compensate for the
   attenuation of the incident excitation radiation caused by the sample,
   the fluorescence intensities were normalized to the water Raman signal.
   The fluorescence intensities were also corrected for the differential
   absorption/re-absorption of the fluorescence signals. The long-term and
   short-term variations in the fluorescence and absorption properties of
   the sewage samples were investigated and the results correlated with
   corresponding BOD values. Fluorescence was found to have reasonable
   correlations (regression similar to 0.94) with the BOD values. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{A laboratory-scale fluidised-bed anaerobic digester with a sintered
   glass carrier, Siran(R), was operated for 8 months on a simulated
   baker's yeast wastewater (12,000 mg soluble COD 1-(1)) at a loading rate
   of 27 kg COD m(-3) d(-1), giving 75\% removal of soluble COD. Percentage
   CO2, H-2 concentration, gas flow rate and pH were measured continuously.
   An on-line bicarbonate alkalinity (BA) monitor was used in experiments
   comparing two control strategies, adjusting digester buffering by
   addition of NaHCO3 solution during organic overloads. The first, an
   on-off controller with a set point at the steady-state level (2700 mg
   CaCO3 1(-1)), maintained BA concentration but resulted in levels above
   the upper set point. Thus, to avoid consuming excess NaHCO3 the rate of
   delivery and solution strength must be carefully adjusted. The second
   was a controller developed from a neural network trained on BA data from
   an anaerobic filter operating on ice-cream processing wastewater
   (alkalinity around 1400 mg CaCO3 1(-1)). Without re-training, despite
   the different steady-state BA levels and reactor type, the neural
   network based controller was capable of maintaining stable BA levels
   during overload without overshoot. Control of BA during overloads did
   not prevent changes in gaseous CO2 and H-2 concentrations and gas flow
   rate. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A two-stage continuous methanotrophic bioreactor was developed for the
   treatment of wastewater contaminated by chlorinated organic solvents,
   The chosen design eliminated the problem of competitive inhibition
   during cometabolic biodegradations by separating the consumption of
   growth substrate (methane) and the degradation of chlorinated organics
   into two stages. In the first stage, a mixed methanotrophic culture was
   grown in a dispersed-growth continuous how stirred tank reactor (CFSTR).
   In the second stage, trichloroethylene (TCE) and/or
   cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (cDCE) contaminated wastewater was mixed with
   the suspended cells from the growth reactor and fed into a plug-how
   reactor (PFRI) where the cometabolic degradation occurred. The mixed
   methanotrophic culture in the CFSTR was grown in a copper-free,
   iron-enriched nitrate mineral salts medium to induce methanotrophic
   cells to produce soluble methane monooxygenase enzymes which are highly
   active in cometabolic degradations. Formate and oxygen were added prior
   to the PFR to enhance the chlorinated organic degradation rates and
   capacities, A kinetic model that incorporates chlorinated organic
   transformation capacity and competitive inhibition was used to develop
   the reactor design and to predict treatment performance for TCE and/or
   cDCE. Model predictions were verified by comparisons with experimental
   data. A bench-scale two-stage reactor (with a 4-h wastewater retention
   time) was demonstrated to be capable of treating wastewater mixtures
   containing TCE (4.7 mg/l) and cDCE (4.8 mg/l) to below the maximum
   contaminant levels (MCLs. 5 mu g/l each) continuously for at least 31 d.
   The optimal overall material cost of methanotrophic cell growth, formate
   amendment, and oxygen amendment for the treatment of TCE and cDCE
   wastewater (5 mg/l each) to the MCLs was estimated to be \$0.17 per 1000
   liters of wastewater. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Preparative solution isoelectric focusing was used to fractionate 50 mg
   of a soil fulvic acid (FA); the harvested fractions were characterized
   with UV-Vis spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography and capillary
   zone electrophoresis (CZE) and showed a distribution in the created pH
   gradient of the focused fulvic fractions as a function of their
   molecular weight. Borate complexation was used in CZE to compare the
   relative acidities of the harvested fractions. Only 32\% of the total FA
   did not interact with the used ampholytes (precipitation), and this FA
   fraction was mainly composed of low-molecular-weight compounds as shown
   with CZE. A capillary-free solution isoelectric focusing (CIEF) method
   was then adapted to the analysis of the same FA, and parallelisms were
   found in the repartition of the focused fulvic fractions. The potential
   of capillary electrophoresis in the isoeletric focusing mode (CIEF) is
   the rapidity of the analysis (40 min) and the use of samples in the
   microliters range; CIEF was used to characterize humic substances from
   different natural environments. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The Biogas Tower Reactor (BTR), a new type of reactor for anaerobic
   waste-water treatment, is presented. The characteristic features of the
   BTR are the tower shape, its modular structure and the internal
   installations. Gas loading, mixing and sludge distribution can be
   controlled. A settler is installed on top of the reactor. Performance
   data of a pilot-scale BTR are presented for the treatment of a yeast
   production effluent. Although these effluents are known to be difficult
   to treat anaerobically (inhibiting products (H2S), pellets with poor
   settling properties), excellent results are obtained with this reactor
   type. The main emphasis in scale-up was placed on the height of the
   reactor and its effects on the hydraulic loading and the sludge
   distribution. The crucial points in scale-up are the connecting
   mechanisms between adjoining modules with regard to sludge distribution
   and liquid mixing. The mechanisms have been mathematically quantified
   and checked on both laboratory-scale and pilot-scale. Finally, the
   mathematical model has been extrapolated to predict the performance of a
   full-scale BTR. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A technique has been developed using alginate-immobilised algae that is
   suitable for in-situ biomonitoring of flowing waters. This approach Hill
   facilitate the site-specific assessment of eutrophication in running
   waters and the prediction of ecosystem response to altered nutrient
   inputs. Effects of the cell immobilisation process were assessed and it
   was demonstrated that entrapment increased the rate of response to, and
   growth in, increased nutrient supply compared to free cells, although
   this effect was not significant at environmentally relevant nutrient
   concentrations. Significant differences in growth were detected when
   nutrients were supplied at a constant concentration but at different
   flow rates (0.5, 16 and 230 cm(3) min(-1)). Growth was determined as the
   rate of change in algal biomass measured using a non-destructive,
   automated scan of the absorbance (650 nm) across thin (similar to 0.75-1
   mm) nylon-supported films of immobilised algal cells. This novel
   technique was compared with the established methodologies of
   chlorophyll-ic extraction and cell enumeration as measurements of algal
   biomass. All three methods showed that algal growth was inversely
   related to how rate of growth medium over the immobilised cells. These
   results demonstrate the value of this technique as a tough, durable and
   sensitive method for the continuous, or `'on-line'', water monitoring of
   algal growth potential in running waters. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A biochemical process has been assessed with a view to removing heavy
   metals from acid mine drainages in which the metal cation removed is
   accumulated in situ as insoluble metal phosphate on the surface of
   Citrobacter N14 cells (Roig et al., 1995). The localized presence of
   inorganic phosphate (P-i) is brought about via the hydrolysis of a
   `'donor'' organic phosphate added to the solution of metals with
   precipitation as MHPO4 bound to the cells. The present work explores the
   potential of immobilized Citrobacter biomass for the recovery of uranium
   from the acid drainage waters of the `'Faith'' mine exploited by ENUSA
   (Ciudad Rodrigo, Salamanca). A physicochemical characterization of the
   acid waste-water from ENUSA was carried out and flow injection analysis
   methods for the determination of uranium and P-i in such water were
   developed and improved. The efficiencies of chemical precipitation (by
   the addition of P-i to the acid water) with regard to
   bioinsolubilization (supplementing the water with an organic phosphate
   that is (later) hydrolysed to P-i) were investigated and compared.
   Additionally, the efficiency of chemical and biochemical precipitation
   as phosphates of uranium present in ENUSA acid drainage water were
   assessed. Furthermore, the relative importance of chemical precipitation
   (by the addition of P-i to the acid water) with regard to
   bioinsolubilization (supplementing the water with an organic phosphate
   that is (later) hydrolysed to P-i plus alcohol) was established. To do
   so, a series of mass balances for chemical precipitation and for
   bioinsolubilization of the metal phosphate was performed. Once the
   efficiency of the bioprocess as regards the removal of uranium when
   glycerol-2-phosphate is used as a substrate had been determined, a major
   question was forthcoming: the search for an efficient and much more
   economical substrate for the process, In this sense, sodium
   tripolyphosphate, one of the main components of many formulations of
   commercial detergents, proved to be a poor substrate, such that the
   quest for an appropriate substrate (cheap, by-product or waste) remains
   open. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Twelve different adsorbents, originating from waste materials, were used
   to treat an effluent. of complex composition. from a chemical Herbs. The
   effectiveness of each adsorbent was measured in terms of its effect on
   the colour (absorbance at 450 nm) and COD levels of the effluent and
   also in terms of its adsorption capacity towards individual constituents
   of the effluent, The results showed that all adsorbents would physically
   adsorb constituents in reversible processes. Some constituents were more
   readily adsorbed than others. This meant that little correlation was
   observed between changes to the colour and COD levels of the effluent,
   because individual constituents made different contributions to these
   properties. The problem is further complicated by adsorbents,
   particularly those which had not been processed, contributing new
   constituents to the effluent. Thermodynamic data obtained from this
   study were used to predict the relative distribution of three
   constituents on the surface of different adsorbents. These results
   suggest that, for this effluent, adsorption onto waste material would be
   most effectively applied by using it in combination with other removal
   techniques. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This work involved the treatment of industrial wastewater from a
   nylon-carpet printing plant in Northern Ireland which currently receives
   no treatment and is discharged straight to sea. As nylon is particularly
   difficult to dye, acid dyes are required for successful colouration, but
   they cause major problems with the plant's effluent disposal. Granular
   activated carbon Filtrasorb 400 was used to treat this effluent in a
   fixed-bed column system. Breakthrough curves from the fixed-bed column
   were shallow, even at low flow rates, which indicated a large mass
   transfer zone and inefficient use of adsorbent. Decrease in adsorbent
   particle size and decrease in linear flow rate produced a better bed
   performance. The bed depth service time (BDST) model proved effective
   for comparison of column variables, with calculated BDST constants
   providing a useful indication of bed performance. The BDST model also
   gave good approximation in predicting a bed performance using the
   relationships postulated by Hutchins (1973). (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Five organic phenolic compounds (phenol, o-chlorophenol, m-chlorophenol,
   p-chlorophenol and m-cresol) hale been used to determine the adsorption
   isotherms for single and bisolute systems from dilute aqueous solutions
   on activated carbon. An experimental technique for the analysis of the
   equilibrium concentration of a bisolute in aqueous solutions using a UV
   spectrophotometer has been successfully developed and employed.
   Experimental data were obtained by conducting experiments in a
   shaker-incubator at 30 C (local average ambient temperature). All common
   types of reported isotherms, including Langmuir. Freundlich, BET
   (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) and empirical types, were tried. For
   single solute systems the experimental data were found to be best
   represented by the Freundlich isotherm for all cases except for phenol,
   which followed the Langmuir isotherm. For bisolute systems, the
   coefficients for all the most commonly used models were determined
   accurately applying a modified Rosenbrock method for non-linear
   optimization. The present and previous published experimental data and
   predicted model results have been analysed statistically to validate the
   applicability of the models. The generalized and empirical models have
   shown a better fit than the other most commonly used models (Langmuir
   and Freundlich). The empirical model has minimal error between predicted
   and experimental values due to more constants in the expression as
   compared to the generalized model, The generalized model has a unique
   characteristic, covering both extremes, Langmuir as well as Freundlich
   type isotherms, and could represent all types of data for
   multi-component systems with fewer coefficients with almost the same
   degree of accuracy as the empirical model. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Magnetic separation was introduced to an activated sludge process to
   improve the solid-liquid separation characteristics of the sludge. The
   process was operated with the intermittent aeration method and applied
   for the removal of organic matter and nitrogen in wastewater. The
   activated sludge supplemented with magnetite (Fe3O4) powder (magnetic
   sludge) exhibits a ferromagnetic property and deposited on the surface
   of magnetic disks due to magnetic force. The magnetic separation
   apparatus (composed of rotary magnetic disks and scrapers) separated
   treated water from the sludge suspension of 13-22 g VSS 1(-1) within 5
   min. Compared with the sedimentational separation process, the magnetic
   separation technique showed better performance. Simultaneous removal of
   about 89\% of TKN and about 92\% of soluble CODct in influent was
   performed under loading rates of 0.92 g CODcr 1(-1) d(-1) and 0.10 g TKN

Abstract = {{Common, cellulose-derived and other naturally occurring organics which
   are likely to be present, or generated in wastewater discharges were
   evaluated. During cyanide analyses? reactive organic compounds produced
   CN- in samples containing oxidized nitrogen ions. The study showed that
   oxidized nitrogen species (NO2- and NO3-) can be generated when
   hypochlorite or hydrogen peroxide is added to ammonia solutions. Under
   the conditions existing during cyanide analysis, nitrate and nitrite
   ions are converted to nitric and nitrous acid respectively. These acids
   react with organic molecules present in solution to form intermediate
   oximes, nitro-alkanes, hydroxamic acids and other transient compounds
   which are unstable in hot, strongly acidic environments. The thermally
   oxidatively labile intermediates break down to produce CN- and other
   degradation products. Some condensation of nitrogen oxides with organics
   in solution may occur prior to distillation, since addition of sulfamic
   acid to samples in the study did not completely eliminate all cyanide
   formation. The formation of these labile intermediates is greatly
   reduced, however, when NOx is removed by sulfamic acid prior to
   distillation. This study revealed the general nature of these cyanide
   forming reactions with common hydroxyl, poly-hydroxyl, aldehyde, ketone
   and other functional groups. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Two methanogenic cultures were grown in the presence of p-cresol as sole
   carbon source or together with a mixture of volatile fatty acids (VFA).
   Both batch cultures produced methane from VFA in-the presence of
   p-cresol, up to concentrations of about 200 ppm, in a first experiment,
   without significant activity inhibition. After several transfers, one of
   the cultures tolerated higher p-cresol concentrations. Only that
   culture, originating from industrial effluents contaminated with
   phenolic compounds, was able to remove p-cresol which was completely
   degraded to methane and carbon dioxide with p-hydroxybenzoate,
   propionate and acetate as detectable intermediate compounds. These
   intermediates did not accumulate in the medium. The addition of VFA as
   auxilliary carbon sources very slightly delayed p-cresol removal in
   batch assays but allowed, on the contrary, the use of higher p-cresol
   influent concentrations in continuous UASB reactors than in the absence
   of VFA. With a mixture of p-cresol:VFA al a COD ratio of 2:1, complete
   COD degradation was reached when operating at an hydraulic retention
   time (HRT) of 0.67 day and at an influent concentration of 650 ppm
   p-cresol. When operating under the same conditions in the absence of
   VFA, around 80\% p-cresol was removed although a near complete
   degradation was reached at influent p-cresol concentrations of 400 ppm

Abstract = {{Information on the identification and occurrence of polar by-products of
   oxidation in water treatment is limited due to the difficulty in
   isolating these compounds from the aquatic matrix. A scheme has been
   developed which permits the simultaneous recovery and pre-concentration
   of mono- and multifunctional carbonyl-containing species from a single
   aqueous sample. Subsequent target-specific derivatization permits the
   identification of aldo- and ketoacids and hydroxy carbonyl species as
   well as aldehydes, ketones, dialdehydes and ketoaldehydes. The same
   aqueous sample can be pre-concentrated on an in-line ion exchange column
   for analysis of organic acids by ion chromatography. An additional
   sample can be analyzed through selective generation of OH radicals
   forming a fluorophore for determination of organic peroxides. Positive
   chemical ionization ion trap mass spectrometry is effectively utilized
   for identification of the derivatized carbonyl-containing species and
   following structural confirmation through analysis of standards, the
   analysis scheme is applied to ozonated aqueous solutions. A cationic
   polymer, commonly used in drinking water treatment, produces trace
   levels of each of the derivatized Fractions. An ozonated surface water
   is analyzed for the carbonyl-containing species and also for the
   formation of peroxides. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The granulation process was quantitatively examined through continuous
   measurement of granular growth in a 5-1 upflow anaerobic sludge blanket
   (UASB) reactor. A synthetic feed composed of glucose, peptone and meat
   extract was used as a substrate with the chemical oxygen demand (GOD)
   concentration of 2000 mg/l. Anaerobic digested sludge was used as a
   seed. During start-up, the sludge loading rate (SLR) was increased,
   based on the specific methanogenic activity (SMA) measured of the
   sludge, with the SLR value maintained consistently at 80\% of the SMA.
   The results show that the SMA of the sludge was increasing rapidly
   immediately after start-up and approaching stabilisation after just 2
   months. Granulation was initiated slowly during the first month, then
   the initiated granules grew rapidly for 3 months with specific granular
   growth rate by diameter (v phi) of 0.02-0.10 d(-1), and finally
   accompanied by the fast decline of v phi, the granules matured. Based on
   the granular growth course, the granulation process is characterised by
   three phases: acclimation; granulation: and maturation. The granular
   sludge, consisting mainly of Methanothrix-like species, was highly
   active and well settleable with a median diameter of 2.6 mm, specific
   methanogenic activity of 1.72 g CH4-COD/gVSS.d and sludge volume index
   of 9.5 ml/gSS. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Wastewater disinfection is most commonly achieved by halogenation,
   ozonation or ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. All of these processes are
   known to be capable of inducing chemical changes among non-microbial
   aqueous constituents, which can lead to changes in effluent toxicity
   behavior. Undiluted effluent samples from seven wastewater treatment
   facilities were exposed to commonly-applied disinfectants
   (chlorination/dechlorination, ozonation and UV irradiation) and assayed
   for their toxicity behavior; Ceriodaphnia dubia survival and
   reproduction were used as measures of chronic toxicity. The results of
   these assays confirmed the ability of all the disinfectants to alter
   toxicity response behavior. The toxicity responses demonstrated
   site-specificity and strong temporal variations. In general, when
   undisinfected effluent did not display toxicity, no toxicity was
   observed following any of the disinfection procedures; when toxicity was
   displayed in the undisinfected effluent, all disinfectants demonstrated
   the ability to alter toxicity, in most cases resulting in an increase.
   The changes in toxicological response attributable to disinfectant
   exposure followed the trend: chlorination/dechlorination > ozonation >
   UV irradiation, but substantial variations from this trend were evident
   in individual samples. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Effluent constituents in a complete ClO2-substituted bleached Kraft mill
   were monitored in process lines and sewers for an extended period to
   determine the transport of these constituents through the mill and its
   treatment system. The end-of-pipe AOX/COD ratio was constant indicating
   that both COD and AOX at this location are lignin residuals that are not
   degraded In the treatment system. The ratio was higher for another mill
   that included Cl-2 in its bleaching sequence. Conductivity at the
   recovery sewer was a good indicator of black liquor upsets. Significant
   BOD-COD correlations were found at the pulp mill and evaporator sewers,
   suggesting that COD from this source is biodegradable. Color and COD
   correlated well at the end-of-pipe, indicating that color originates
   from carbon that is not removed during treatment. Color also increased
   across the pond, suggesting that much of the organic material in the
   lagoon is not mineralized, but converted into smaller more chromophoric
   units. No trisubstituted or higher chlorophenols or chlorinated dioxins
   or furans were found in any of the bleach line filtrates. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The influence of pre-hydrolysis of D-stage filtrate on the
   biotreatability of bleached kraft mill effluent was investigated at the
   bench scale using four continuous aerated `'lagoons'' operated in
   parallel. In comparison to non-hydrolyzed effluent, pre-hydrolysis of
   D-stage filtrate at pH 11 and 60 degrees C for an hour reduced the AOX
   inlet to the treatment system by 40\% and the outlet AOX discharge after
   biological treatment by 13\%. Overall, pre-hydrolysis followed by
   biological treatment resulted in a 63\% AOX removal, which was
   significantly higher, at the 95\% confidence level, than the 58\%
   removal achieved by biological treatment alone. COD and BOD5 removals
   for both feeds were 45 and 99\%, respectively, and were not
   significantly affected by the pretreatment. Studies on the
   pre-hydrolysis effect on known non-biodegradable organochlorine model
   compounds showed that pre-hydrolysis was effective in improving the
   biodegradability of a monomeric model, but not the dimeric model
   compound. (C) 1991 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation of an effluent containing a mixture of 2,4- and
   2,6-diaminotoluene (DAT) was studied. Biodegradation was found to occur
   to a great extent only in the presence of acclimated microorganisms and
   under aerobic conditions. The amount of biodegradable DAT was highly
   dependent on the quantity of microorganisms inoculated. Inhibition was
   observed at high DAT concentrations. A batch activated sludge system,
   using activated carbon as `'synthetic sludge'', was tested in order to
   improve the degradation yield. Studies on different effluents,
   containing from 300 to 1600 mg/l DAT, showed that biodegradation
   percentages were improved over ail the studied concentration range using
   activated carbon, whereas inhibition was lowered at high concentrations.
   Only one bacterial strain, identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa which
   uses DAT as the sole carbon source. was isolated from the crude
   inoculum. This result suggests that this strain is responsible for the
   biodegradation observed. As far as the scope of this study is concerned,
   we noticed that this strain did not use the amino group of DAT as
   nitrogen source. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Fulvic and humic acids isolated from seepage waters of four municipal
   waste landfills and one hazardous waste landfill were analysed by Curie
   point pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS).
   Furthermore, fulvic and humic acids were subjected to acid hydrolysis
   followed by alkaline hydrolysis. The hydrolysis products were analysed
   by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and the residues by
   Py-GC/MS. Results show that the pyrolysis products of the fulvic and
   humic acids at a pyrolysis temperature of 770 degrees C are similar
   before and after acid/alkaline hydrolysis. The pyrolysis products are
   composed mainly of aromatic compounds like alkylbenzenes,
   alkylnaphthalenes and higher condensed aromatic substances; aliphatic
   constituents are detectable only in trace amounts. At a pyrolysis
   temperature of 510 degrees C the pyroloysis products of the isolated
   fulvic and humic acids are dominated by benzoic acids, phenols and
   straight chain acids. The compound composition is similar to the one
   obtained from GC/MS analysis of the soluble hydrolysis products. Results
   indicate that the fulvic and humic substances from leachate water of
   waste deposits are built up of an aromatic nucleus, which is not
   completely decomposed upon pyrolysis at 510 degrees C. The nucleus seems
   to be surrounded by hydrolysable structural units composed of aromatic
   acids and phenols linked via ester and ether bonds to the fulvic
   respectively humic acid core. Comparison with pyrolysis products
   obtained from soil humic substnaces indicates a higher degree of
   aromaticity and thermal stability of part of the macromolecular network.
   In addition results indicate that the structural composition of the
   fulvic and humic acids in leachate waters from waste deposits is
   independent from leachate quality. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Hypolimnetic aeration has been part of a successful restoration strategy
   for the shallow urban lake, Lake Tegel, in Berlin since 1980. From this
   time to the present, extensive limnological data on the lake's water
   quality have been collected which have been used to validate a
   one-dimensional water quality model. Three cases are discussed: full
   operation of a network of 15 aerators, intermittent operation as water
   quality improved and no aeration as is the present situation. The effect
   of the hypolimnetic aerator was modelled once as a stirrer and also as a
   bubbler. While both are designed to impart mechanical energy to the
   water column to promote mixing by means of a column of bubbles, stirrers
   are meant to restrict the mixing between the epilimnion and hypolimnion
   by collecting the bubble streams before they penetrate the upper layer.
   On the other hand, for bubblers the bubble column continues unimpeded to
   the surface. We conclude that the design of the hypolimnetic aerators
   employed in Lake Tegel behave more closely to a bubble plume and thus
   there is considerable mixing between the hypolimnion and epilimnion. (C)

Abstract = {{The effect of experimental technique on strontium distribution
   coefficients (K-d's) was determined as part of an investigation of
   strontium geochemical transport properties of surficial sediment from
   the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Idaho. The investigation was
   conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey and Idaho State University, in
   cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy. Batch experiments were
   conducted to quantify the effect of different experimental techniques on
   experimentally derived strontium K-d's at a fixed pH of 8.0.
   Combinations of three variables were investigated: method of sample
   agitation (rotating-mixer and shaker table), ratio of the
   mass-of-sediment to the volume-of-reaction-solution (1:2 and 1:20), and
   method of sediment preparation (crushed and non-crushed). Strontium
   K-d's ranged from 11 to 23 mlg(-1) among all three experimental
   variables examined. Strontium K-d's were bimodally grouped around 12 and
   21 mlg(-1). Among the three experimental variables examined, the
   mass-to-volume ratio appeared to be the only one that could account for
   this bimodal distribution. The bimodal distribution of the derived
   strontium K-d's may. occur because the two different mass-to-volume
   ratios represent different natural systems. The high mass-to-volume
   ratio of 1:2 models a natural system, such as an aquifer, in which there
   is an abundance of favorable sorption sites relative to the amount of
   strontium in solution. The low mass-to-volume ratio of 1:20 models a
   natural system, such as a stream, in which the relative amount of
   strontium in Solution exceeds the favorable surface sorption site
   concentration. Except for low mass-to-volume ratios of non-crushed
   sediment using a rotating mixer, the method of agitation and sediment
   preparation appears to have little influence on derived strontium K-d's.

Abstract = {{Hollow-fibre modules combined with a pumping device are presented as a
   superior technique for obtaining particle-free lakewater as compared to
   conventional membrane filtration. The separation procedure as shown by
   chlorophyll a and ATP measurements is very efficient and gentle. The
   integrity of delicate flagellates as tested by the loss of their
   flagella is maintained at a very high percentage. The filtration process
   was shown to have no effects on the concentration of inorganic ions
   (ammonium, nitrite, o-phosphate), amino acids (alanine, phenylalanine)
   and sugars (glucose, maltotriose) in mu M concentrations. This
   technology enables the preparation of large volumes of particle-free
   water from lakewater of eutrophic lakes with high phytoplankton
   densities that clog conventional membranes after passage of a few
   millilitres. The short turnover times of many inorganic and organic
   compounds in lakewater do not allow transport of water to the laboratory
   for separating the particulate fraction without essential changes in the
   water composition. With hollow-fibre filters a rapid separation can be
   conducted quasi in situ on the boat within seconds after taking samples,
   thus reducing the formation of artifacts in compound composition and
   concentration. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A large fraction of the natural organic matter (NOM) in potable water
   sources can be extracted by adsorption onto iron-oxide-coated sand

   and UV absorbance spectra and their reactivity with chlorine, before and
   after the waters were contacted with IOCS. The IOCS preferentially
   adsorbs acidic fractions of NOM and NOM molecules that are enriched in
   aromatic and carboxylic carbon. The yield of chloro-organic compounds
   (quantified as total organo-halide) produced upon chlorination of the
   NOM or its major fractions correlates with the specific absorbance
   (A(s)) at 254 nm. IOCS may be useful for removing disinfection
   by-product (DBP) precursors from potable waters and/or as a medium for

Abstract = {{In this study, the biosorption kinetics of lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and
   cadmium (Cd) ions on the biomass of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PU21 (Rip64)
   was investigated. Effects of environmental factors and growth conditions
   on the biosorption were studied. Efficiency of metal ion recovery from
   metal-loaded biomass and subsequent regeneration of the biosorbent were
   also determined. The results show that, at pH 5.5, the resting cells
   were able to uptake up to 110 mg Pb/g dry cell, and the inactivated
   cells can adsorb 70 mg Pb/g dry cell. Biomass of P. aeruginosa PU21
   (Rip64) had lower adsorption capacities for Cu and Cd ions than for lead
   ions. The resting cells had the maximum uptake of 23 mg Cu/g dry cell
   (at pH 5.0) and had 58 mg Cd/g dry cell (at pH 6.0). The saturation
   uptake capacities of inactivated cells were 19 mg Cu/g dry cell (at pH
   5.0) and 43 mg Cd/g dry cell (at pH 6.0). The resting cells held optimal
   Pb adsorption capacity at the early stationary phase, whereas the best
   uptake of cadmium was observed with the cells which were of exponential
   growth phase. The growth phase exhibited no effects on the adsorption of
   Cu, however. The increase in mercury concentration (from 0 to 50 mg
   Hg2+/litre) in the growth media did not significantly affect the
   adsorption capacities of Pb2+, CU2+ and Cd2+. However, the saturation
   uptake capacity and metal-cell affinity tended to increase as pH
   increased, until metals precipitated as metal hydroxides when the pH
   exceeded some threshold values. Adjusting the pH value to about 2.0
   resulted in 98, 98 and 82\% recovery of Pb, Cu and Cd, respectively. The
   biomass resulted from desorption processes was able to retain
   approximately 80\% of original adsorption capacity fbr Pb and Cu with
   four repeated adsorption and recovery runs. Regeneration of biomass
   appears to enhance the uptake capacity of Cd by nearly 35\% after four
   adsorption/desorption cycles. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Gel beads (3 mm) of PVA-SbQ were cast by entrapment in Ca-alginate beads
   prior to photo-induced crosslinking of the synthetic polymer. Such beads
   have maintained their physical integrity, being continuously exposed to
   domestic wastewater for more than 2 years. Gel strength measurements
   indicated that the alginate gel network had been degraded and lost. Gel
   entrapment of homogenized nitrifying sludge gave an immediate 30\% loss
   of activity compared to that of the same sludge kept in suspension, but
   it reached the same level within 3 days in a sequenced batch reactor. A
   continuous 4-litre lab-scale reactor containing 25\% (v/v) gel-entrapped
   nitrifying sludge was run successfully fed with ammonium-enriched
   domestic wastewater for a period of 300 days. At 30 degrees C, the
   system reached a steady-state activity of 15 mgN pr litre and hour (/Lh)
   after a month. After reducing the temperature successively to 20 and 10
   degrees C, at least 75\% of this activity was maintained. Even at 10
   degrees C, activities could be increased to 25 mgN/Lh by improving
   oxygen transfer by increased aeration or stirring, verifying that oxygen
   transfer should be considered the rate-limiting factor of the system.
   Despite an organic load of 10-50 mgCOD/Lh during the whole period,
   heterothropic overgrowth or grazing protozoa could not be detected
   attached to the beads, even though such organisms were abundant in the
   sludge leaving the reactor. The system presented may be suitable for
   specially designed full-scale reactors with short hydraulic retention
   times, as well as an additive to existing biofilm or activated sludge
   nitrification plants. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Structural properties of activated sludge flocs were found to be
   sensitive to small changes in ionic strength and ionic composition.
   Removal of calcium from the bulk water by an ion exchange resin resulted
   in a release of calcium ions and organic macromolecules from the flocs.
   Dilution of the activated sludge with deionized water resulted in a
   release of calcium and organics to bulk water as well. In both types of
   experiments the small particles in the bulk water showed an increase in
   the negative surface charge density, as measured by zeta-potential or by
   colloidal titration. A change in the repulsive forces due to calcium
   desorption were possibly more important for the observed flee
   disintegration than were the effects of changes in the ionic strength.
   The kinetics of dissolution of calcium were shown to be controlled by
   Fickian diffusion. A model of a typical activated sludge floc. taking
   into account the colloidal stability, is suggested, where a `'cloud'' of
   organic macromolecules and single bacteria are attached with very weak
   Forces to a more rigid backbone consisting of fibers, filamentous
   bacteria and bacterial colonies. The observed changes in stability of
   the flocs leading to increased turbidity have major practical
   implications in the solid-liquid separation, and effects on effluent
   quality and dewatering are discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In a laboratory study, the authors determined the solid-liquid partition
   coefficient (Kd) for technetium (Tc-95m) in Canadian Shield lake
   sediments and the loss rate of Tc-95m from water to sediment for more
   accurate assessment model predictions. The K-d values were determined
   under oxic and anoxic (reducing) conditions at sediment-water ratios of
   1, 10 and 50\% for organic sediments and 10\% for sand and clayey
   silt/sand sediments. K-d values for organic sediment at ratios of 1, 10
   and 50\% had geometric means (GMs) (x)(divided by) geometric standard
   deviations (GSDs) of 4.3 (x)(divided by) 2.6, 6.9 (x)(divided by) 1.3
   and 13.0 (x)(divided by) 0.1 litres kg(-1) dry weight (dw),
   respectively, under oxic conditions, and 13.7 (x)(divided by) 2.4, 9243
   (x)(divided by) 0.2 and 206 (x)(divided by) 0.2 litres kg(-1) dw,
   respectively, under anoxic conditions. K-d values for sand and clayey
   silt/sand sediments have GMs of less than or equal to 0.5 litres kg(-1)
   dw under both oxic and anoxic conditions. On the basis of the Kj values
   for organic sediments, the water-to-sediment loss rate for technetium in
   well-oxygenated Canadian Shield lakes would have a GM of about 0.15
   a(-1) and GSD of 2.3, whereas those Lakes whose bottom waters experience
   periods of anoxia may be better represented by a GM of 1.3 a(-1) and a
   GSD of 5.6. Therefore, anoxic organic lake sediments should form an
   effective barrier for the transport of long-lived Tc-99 from an
   underground disposal vault, although movement of Tc-99 with organic
   colloids is a possibility. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Microcystins are a family of potently hepatotoxic heptapeptides which
   have been detected in a wide range of cyanobacteria. The novel
   application of polarography in the analysis of these cyclic peptides has
   demonstrated binding of copper and zinc to microcystins in the
   aqueous-phase at environmentally-relevant pH values. This
   electroanalytical technique measured the shift in reduction potential
   and decrease in height of metal polarogram peaks as a function of
   increasing microcystin concentration. The successive formation of
   intermediate complexes was investigated and the strength of coordination
   was evaluated in terms of a formation constant (K-1) for each
   metal/microcystin combination. The effects of a single amino acid
   substitution on the formation constants of the heptapeptide was
   investigated with microcystin-LR, microcystin-LW and microcystin-LF. The
   calculated formation constants (log K-1) indicated that all three
   microcystins are intermediate strength metal ligands and that
   substitution of arginine with either tryptophan (microcystin-LW) or
   phenylalanine (microcystin-LF) appeared to have no discernible effect on
   the overall binding capacity. Reducing the pH of the supporting
   electrolyte strongly influenced complexation of microcystin-LR with
   copper, indicating that at pH 5.5 only a weak labile complex was formed.
   Complexation between microcystin-LR and zinc, however, was not
   influenced as strongly by pH. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of using a fluidized-bed reactor with bioaugmentation to
   treat low-strength wastewater or slightly contaminated groundwater was
   evaluated. Tap water spiked with 1.6 to 12.6 mg/L of 1-naphthylamine was
   treated in a fluidized-bed reactor with a hydraulic retention time of
   6.2 to 13.3 h. With conventional operation, the reactor was unable to
   maintain consistent-removal because of cell washout. Continuous removal
   efficiency was greater than 90\% using bioaugmentation through periodic
   addition of acclimated cells from an off-line enricher-reactor. The
   concept demonstrated by this research presents an alternative for
   biological treatment of wastes (dilute wastewaters and contaminated
   groundwater) which are not normally considered good candidates for
   biological treatment. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Totally chlorine-free (TCF) bleaching technologies can result in high
   concentrations of residual hydrogen peroxide in combined mill effluent.
   This study was undertaken to determine the effect of hydrogen peroxide
   on effluent characteristics (biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), toxicity),
   biological sludge characteristics (oxygen uptake rate (OUR), catalase
   activity) and the efficiency with which laboratory-scale activated
   sludge reactors treat TCF bleached kraft mill (BKM) effluents.
   The presence of over 20 mg/L hydrogen peroxide in TCF-BKM effluent was
   found to decrease the BOD by up to 25\%. The complete decomposition of
   hydrogen peroxide concentrations of up to 1000 mg/L was not found to
   have an effect upon the effluent toxicity, as measured by Microtox(R).
   Increasing concentrations (5-1000 mg/L influent) of peroxide ii;ere
   continually added to a reactor treating combined TCF-bleached kraft mill
   effluent. Treatment efficiency, as measured bu removal of BOD, chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) and toxicity, was found to be unaffected by hydrogen
   peroxide concentrations of up to 1000 mg/L influent.
   Several methods of gauging reactor acclimatization to hydrogen peroxide
   were performed throughout the study. Activated sludge mixed liquor
   samples from the continuous reactor were shocked with varying
   concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Oxygen uptake rate of activated
   sludge samples, especially when unacclimated. was found to decrease
   dramatically when subjected to shock loads of increasing concentrations
   of peroxide. Activated sludge which had been acclimated to hydrogen
   peroxide in the reactor feed was more resistant to H2O2 shock loading.
   Catalase-equivalent induction in activated sludge was also monitored as
   a means of gauging reactor acclimatization to the presence of hydrogen
   peroxide. Catalase-equivalent activity was found to increase with
   increasing H2O2 feed concentration, and appeared to reach a maximum
   level of 1.3-1.5 (min g biomass)(-1). It was concluded that activated
   sludge is able to treat TCF bleached kraft mill effluent which contained
   H2O2, and that the microorganisms present in the sludge were able to
   adapt to receiving such an effluent. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Two marine microalgal isolates from a sewage outfall site in St Andrews
   Bay, Scotland were cultured on corrugated raceways (2.5 m long, 0.2 m
   wide) to determine their ability to remove ammonium and orthophosphate
   from wastewater diluted with seawater. The isolates (SA91B33,
   preliminarily identified as Phaeodactylum tricornutum, and SA91CY1,
   Oscillatoria sp.) both have surface-adherent properties and were
   selected from 102 isolates for optimal nutrient removal and culture
   dominance in both batch and continuous culture on wastewater under
   controlled environmental conditions. Wastewater (primary sewage
   effluent) was diluted 1:1 with sterile seawater and continuously added
   to raceway algal cultures grown under ambient conditions. Nutrient
   concentrations in the diluted wastewater influent and in the effluent
   from the raceways were measured daily. Both isolates remained unialgal
   during the four month culture period and continuously removed 100\% of
   ammonium and orthophosphate from the wastewater. Nitrite and nitrate
   levels in both influent and effluent were negligible. Measurement of
   influent and effluent nutrient concentrations over 24 h showed ammonium
   and orthophosphate removal remained unaltered during the diurnal cycle.
   These results indicate the potential for using microalgal species grown

Abstract = {{Hydrophobic organic pollutants have a low aqueous solubility and tend to
   he adsorbed by suspended particulates, leading eventually to their
   storage in bed sediments. However, studies on the adsorption behaviour
   of extremely hydrophobic organic contaminants are scarce, and require
   more in-depth investigations. In this work, partition of two classes of
   hydrophobic contaminants was studied first in well-defined mineral
   particles covered with well-characterised humic substances, moving on to
   mixed end-member samples from the Tees, Tamar and Humber estuaries along
   a salinity gradient. Such chemicals partitioned more strongly to humic
   coatings than to estuarine particles, and the organic carbon normalised
   partition coefficient (K-oc) values were well correlated with the
   aromaticity of organic coatings, suggesting that organic matter on
   estuarine particles consists of very complex mixtures with varying
   affinity for pollutant molecules. The partition coefficient (K-p) for
   permethrin and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate decreased with pH but
   increased with salinity, due to increased chemical hydrolysis in higher
   pH waters and decreased solubility in saline waters. The organic
   coatings on particles induced a more negative charge, due to the
   presence of uncomplexed carboxylic and phenolic hydroxyl groups.
   Estuarine suspended particles showed invariant electrophoretic mobility
   above 3 PSU salinity. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   liter water samples, salted with 100 g of sodium chloride, were
   extracted by microextraction using 2 x 3 mi of hexane. The extracts were
   analyzed by gas chromatographic-ion-trap detection-mass spectrometry
   (GC-ITD-MS). Mean recoveries from spiked reagent water were 99 +/- 7 and
   95 +/- 8\% for MIB and geosmin (spiked with 5-40 ng/l), respectively.
   For other compounds, recoveries ranged between 81 and 110\%, with the
   exception of hexanal, heptanal and benzaldehyde. The method detection
   limits were as low as 1 ng/l for geosmin and MIB, 0.5-6 ng/l for ketones
   and 5-25 ng/l for other compounds. Recoveries end precision for most of
   the compounds investigated from spiked river water were similar to those

Abstract = {{The photocatalytic degradation of four chlorinated aromatic compounds,
   namely pentachlorophenol (PCP), 2,4,-dichlorophenol (2,4,-DCP),
   3,5,-dichlorophenol (3,5,-DCP), and 2,3,5,-trichlorophenol (2,3,5,-TCP),
   was investigated in the presence of an aqueous suspension of TiO2
   irradiated with near-UV light. The toxicity of the transient species was
   compared to that observed for the parent compound. The comparison was
   carried out by monitoring the inhibition in bacterial respiration
   (Escherichia coli) by measuring the CO2 in the aqueous culture medium
   using flow injection analysis (FIA). Only in the case of PCP and
   2,3,5,-TCP were the intermediates. identified by HPLC and GC/MS, found
   to be more toxic than the parent compound. The principal intermediates
   observed during the photocatalytic oxidation process of PCP were
   2,3,5,6,-tetrachloro-1,4,-hydroquinone,
   2,3,5,6,-tetrachloro-1,4,-benzoquinone and 2, 3,5,6,-tetrachlorophenol.
   In the case of 2,3,5,-TCP and 3,5,-DCP, the identified intermediates
   were 2,3,5,-trichloro-1,4,-hydroquinone and
   2,5,dichloro-1,4,-hydroquinone, respectively. The intermediates of
   2,4,-DCP were not identified. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Approaches for assessing the effects of lowering nutrients on periphyton
   biomass in streams and rivers are poorly developed in contrast to those
   for lakes. Here we present two complementary approaches to assess target
   nutrient concentrations in streams, given desired mean and maximum
   standing crops of benthic algal chlorophyll. In the first approach. a
   reference portion or reach of the river that typically exhibits
   acceptable levels of benthic chlorophyll is identified (i.e. seasonal
   mean and maximum values do not exceed desirable levels), and the target
   levels for instream nutrient concentrations are defined by mean nutrient
   levels in the reference region. In the second approach, regression and
   graphical analyses of a large stream database are used to identify
   acceptable levels of instream total N and total P. The first approach
   supplies site-specific nutrient targets, whereas the second places
   nutrient control into a broader, more comparative perspective. In order
   to link these target concentrations to specific nutrient control
   measures, we describe a spreadsheet model that can be used to translate
   changes in external loading by point sources into predicted new instream
   nutrient concentrations. These quantitative methods are applied here to
   the control of nuisance algal growth in the Clark Fork River, Montana.
   We suggest that, in general, maintenance of mean instream total N
   concentrations below 350 mu g l(-1) and total P below 30 mu g l(-1) will
   result in mean benthic algal chlorophyll a density below nuisance levels
   of 100 mg m(-2) in most streams. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Sources and transport of organic carbon were studied in two large,
   Sonoran desert watersheds (Salt and Verde rivers) and a two-reservoir
   system on the Verde River. Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations in
   the unregulated rivers above the reservoirs did not follow a simple
   relationship with flow. TOC concentrations usually declined during
   spring runoff and reached low concentrations (1-3 mg L-1) by early
   summer. In most years, distinct peaks (10-30 mg L-1) occurred in late
   summer, coincident with small but abrupt increases in flow associated
   with the first monsoon rains. A two-reservoir mass balance showed that
   72\% of the particulate organic carbon (POC) input was retained,
   probably due largely to simple sedimentation. Production of dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) within the reservoir was 41\% of the inflow
   loading, even though the reservoirs accounted for only 0.14\% of the
   watershed area. Reservoir DOC production comprised a large fraction of
   total watershed production because upstream DOC production was extremely
   low (0.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), the reservoirs were moderately productive,
   and water residence times were fairly long during most of the year. We
   postulate that reservoirs are major contributors to total watershed DOC
   production in arid regions. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on experiments with a lab-scale horizontal-flow
   anaerobic immobilized sludge (HAIS) reactor treating synthetic substrate
   aiming to observe temporal and spatial variations of its monitoring
   performance parameters. The bench-scale HAIS reactor was filled with
   polyurethane foam matrices containing immobilized anaerobic sludge taken
   from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor treating diluted
   piggery wastewater. A synthetic substrate composed of glucose as the
   main carbon source (chemical oxygen demand - SOD of 2090 mg l(-1)) was
   used for feeding the HAIS reactor in two experiments with bed porosities
   (epsilon) of 0.4 and 0.24 and at hydraulic detention times (HDT) of 8.0
   and 4.8 h, respectively. The temperature was maintained at 30 degrees C,
   and COD, volatile fatty acids (VFA), total alkalinity (TA) and pH were
   monitored in the effluent stream (length to diameter ratio - L/D of 20)
   and intermediate ports along the reactor's length (L/D of 4, 8, 12 and
   16). CH4 concentration in the gas was determined daily for evaluating
   the start-up period duration. The short start-up period duration (6
   days) in both the experiments confirmed that a HAIS reactor can provide
   favorable environmental conditions for rapid biomass acclimatization,
   growth and retention. COD removal efficiencies of 98\% were attained in
   the first experiment (epsilon of 0.4) and the effluent VFA concentration
   was lowered to 15 mg l(-1). At the L/D ratio of 4 in the first sampling
   port, corresponding to a HDT of 1.6 h, the COD removal efficiency
   achieved 72\%. In the second experiment (epsilon of 0.24), the maximum
   COD removal efficiency was 80\% and the effluent VFA leveled 350 mg
   l(-1). Channeling due to the low bed porosity was found to be the main
   factor responsible for the poor performance of the reactor operating at
   epsilon of 0.24. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The autoxidation of aqueous SO2 (HSO2-, SO32-) was applied to induce the
   solubilization of organic compounds modelling oil components (toluene,

   gas-liquid interface, under mild conditions. Basing on the
   spectrophotometric and chromatographic evidence for the successive
   substitution of sulphonic acid functions, the route for sulphonation of
   these compounds was suggested. The results of kinetic measurements
   related to the formation of S-VI due to oxidation of S-IV and to the
   decay of the initial organic compound due to its sulphonation were
   discussed in terms of a chain reaction with competitive inhibition. The
   possible use of the induced solubilization of oil components for the
   removal of oil splashes, for instance in sewage management, was put

Abstract = {{A fluidized-bed granular activated carbon (GAC) bioreactor was evaluated
   for anaerobically treating wastewater containing pentachlorophenol
   (PCP). PCP removal efficiencies of greater than 99.9\% were achieved at
   PCP loadings as high as 4 g/kg of GAC per day and influent PCP
   concentrations as high as 1333 mg/litre. In addition to PCP, ethanol was
   Fed to the bioreactors as the primary substrate. The chemical oxygen
   demand (COD) loading to the reactor was increased several times as high
   as 63 g/kg of GAC per day using reactor empty bed contact rimes as low
   as 9.3 h in order to exhaust the adsorptive capacity of the GAC for PCP,
   thus allowing for the development of a PCP-degrading biofilm on the
   carbon. A major proportion of the influent COD, ranging from 70 to 90\%,
   was converted to methane, which constituted more than 85\% of the
   product eas stream. Due to incomplete mineralization, nearly all PCP was
   stoichiometrically converted to 3- and 4-chlorophenols. Low levels of
   2,4,6- and 3.4,5-trichlorophenols, 2,4- and 3,4-dichlorophenols rind
   phenol were observed in the reactor. The primary biotransformation
   product of PCP, 4-chlorophenol. inhibited the methanogenic culture at
   concentrations as low as 116 mg/litre. Toxicity was minimized by
   controlling the influent PCP concentration, the primary source of the
   inhibitory products. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{UV spectra of natural organic matter (NOM) can be represented by three
   bands, each a Gaussian function of energy. The bands, referred to as the
   local-excitation (LE), benzenoid (Bz) and electron-transfer (ET) bands,
   can be ascribed to three types of electronic transitions typical in
   aromatic compounds. At wavelengths from 200 to 400 nm, an adequate fit
   to the spectrum can be obtained by consideration of only the Bz and ET
   bands. The parameters of these two bands are sensitive to the
   composition of NOM and to alterations in NOM caused by coagulation and
   chlorination. Removal of NOM fractions with higher-than-average
   concentrations of carboxyl-, hydroxyl- and ester-substituted aromatic
   rings or oxidation of those fractions by chlorine decreases the
   intensity and width of the ET and Bz bands. The ratio of absorbances at
   the band maxima is an indicator of the average degree of activation of
   the aromatic rings and permits prediction of the reactivity of the
   aromatic moiety in chlorination reactions. In addition, measurements of
   absorbance changes induced by chlorination permit one to monitor certain
   aspects of chlorination reactions in situ and to evaluate the formation
   of disinfection by-products. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Eleven geographically and hydrologically diverse sediment samples were
   collected from major rivers of China and determined for the surface
   properties. The results indicate the sediments have a large variation in
   surface area (6.9-16.0 m(2)/g of SSA(N2), 35.6-73.2 m(2)/g Of SSA(CPB),
   surface site density (10.3-149.8 mu mol/g) and surface acidity constants
   (1.56-2.50 of pK(s.a1)(int), and 3.75-5.58 of pK(s.a2)(int)) but a small
   difference in PZSE (3.0-4.0). Within the pH range 3.0-9.0, all sediments
   present negative surface charges. Their surface charge distribution
   curves with pH extend between these of SiO2, montmorillonite. kaolinite,
   alpha-MnO2, calcite and gamma-Al2O3;. Correlation analysis reveals that
   surface area and surface site density of the sediments are correlated
   strongly with reactive and amorphous iron oxides, total aluminum, clay
   and total organic carbon, while surface acidity constants, PZSE and the
   permanent structural charge only show a weak correlation with total
   aluminum in the sediments. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The possible effects of antibiotic drug contamination in marine and

   Five drugs, namely aminosidine (A), bacitracin (B), erythromycin (E),
   flumequine (F) and lincomycin (L), were subjected to toxicity tests
   using nauplii and cysts of Artemia as a model of drug contamination from
   intensive farming. Tests on nauplii were performed by the ArToxKit-M
   test (Persoone and Van Haecke, 1981), test on cysts by our experimental
   protocol (Migliore et al., 1993a, b). The lethal effect on nauplii were
   evaluated between 24 and 120 h: the sequence of decreasing toxicity was
   B > F > L > A > E. A high toxicity of B was recorded. In addition, B and
   F were tested on cysts. B significantly lowered hatching; this depended
   on the interference of B with normal development. F did not depress
   hatching, but it deeply altered nauplii pigmentation. The interest in
   assessing the possible environmental risks due to drugs used in
   intensive farming end the need for suitable standards to improve
   sea-water quality is discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Fermented swine waste was compared to acetate for supplementation of
   bench-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) to improve nutrient
   removal. Swine waste solids were fermented at room temperature for 10
   days. The SBRs were fed diluted swine wastewater and operated on a cycle
   consisting of the following phases: 10-min anoxic fill, 13-h oxic: 7-h
   anoxic, 3-h oxic, 40-min settling, 10-min draw. Supplemental organic
   matter was added at the beginning of the anoxic phase. There was
   essentially no difference in performance of the reactors supplemented
   with either acetate or fermented swine waste: both achieved a total
   nitrogen removal of 90\% and a total phosphorus removal of 89\%. In
   comparison, a control reactor (receiving no supplementation) achieved
   total nitrogen and total phosphorus removals of 76 and 15\%,
   respectively. Sludge phosphorus contents of the supplemented reactors
   were above 7\% of volatile suspended solids, compared to sludge
   phosphorus content of less than 1\% for the control reactor. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{A 5-year study on nitrogen dynamics were performed in a pristine
   heathland catchment (2.55 km(2)) in southern Norway. The catchment
   received 1.6 g total N m(-2)yr(-1) from wet and dry deposition, which is
   nearly tenfold more than that of northern Norway. Compared to most
   Norwegian catchments and forested areas, there is only a modest
   depression in mid-summer nitrate in runoff from winter maxima of nearly
   250 mu g litre(-1) to late summer minima of 50-100 mu g NO3-N litre(-1).
   N:P-ratios in runoff was strongly skewed towards P-limitation, and
   concentrations of both phosphate and total-P were normally below
   detection limits (<1 mu g litre(-1)). The nitrate response of a three
   days P-enrichment in late May in the main brook draining the area was
   monitored continuously with a 10-min resolution for two months. The data
   confirmed a strong P-limitation and revealed a strong nitrate uptake and
   diurnal oscillations in nitrate concentrations over a period of more
   than one month following the P-enrichment. Over this period, mid-day
   concentrations were reduced by a factor of 2-3 relative to night maxima.
   Such reductions in nitrate during day relative to night-time may have
   profound effect on transport or budget estimates based on day-time
   samples only. Nitrate contributed normally 20-30\% to anion acidity, and
   over the summer period there was a significant negative correlation
   between nitrate concentrations and pH, suggesting that increased
   N-uptake could also affect pH of such low-alkalinity systems. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The formation rate in water of the blue phosphoantimonylmolybdenum
   complex declines both with decreasing phosphate concentration (studied
   range 5-500 mu g PO4-P l(-1)) and decreasing reaction temperature
   (studied range + I to + 21 degrees C). At +15 degrees C, only solutions
   containing greater than or equal to 50 mu g POL-P l(-1) reached full
   colour expression within 5 min, and at +10 degrees C all tested
   concentrations needed a longer reaction time. At temperatures below +15
   degrees C, not even a reaction time of 10 min is always sufficient for
   complete colour development. For instance, at +7 degrees C, maximum
   absorbance level is reached in 10 min only at concentrations greater
   than or equal to 250 mu g PO4-P l(-1), whereas a solution of 5 mu g
   PO4-P l(-1) requires about 30 min. Slow formation rate of the coloured
   complex is a possible, insidious source of under-estimation,
   particularly when determining low concentrations of phosphate. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The system performance of an anaerobic relating biological contactor
   (AnRBC) for the treatment of high-strength synthetic wastewater was
   investigated under different flow rates and influent organic strengths.
   In the steady-state condition, the removal efficiencies of COD and BOD
   increased as the hydraulic retention time (HRT) increased or the
   influent organic strength decreased. The overall COD removal
   efficiencies ranged from 74 to 82\% at an HRT of 32 h, from 56 to 61\%
   at an HRT of 16 h, and from 44 to 53\% at an HRT of 8 h. In view of
   these results, it was concluded that the AnRBC reactor is an effective
   treatment process at an HRT of 32 h and influent COD between 3248 and
   12150 mg l(-1). Most organic compounds were removed in the first two
   stages of the AnRBC indicating that a two-stage reactor may be
   sufficient in practical applications. The microscopic observations
   showed that the acetogenic microorganisms were predominant in the first
   two stages while the methanogenic microorganisms were predominant in the
   last two stages. The experimental observations were confirmed by
   performing a theoretical evaluation of the steady-state biofilm
   thickness, the mass balance analysis and the methane production to allow
   insight into the performance of an AnRBC process. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The mechanisms of the removal from anaerobically treated wastewaters of
   those metal ions which do not form precipitates with sulphide or
   carbonate ions, or which form highly soluble precipitates, has been
   little studied to date. Therefore, the removal of manganese as a
   representative of this group was specifically investigated in the course
   of a wider project studying metal removal in laboratory-scale UASB
   reactors. Mn removal, in the absence of sulphate in the reactor feed,
   was low at 7.2\%, but up to 40\% Mn removal could be achieved in the
   presence of sulphate. Mn was removed by adsorption onto the existing
   solids in the sludge and onto newly grown biomass, and also by
   co-precipitation processes, which can be strongly enhanced by other
   heavy metal ions in solution. In the presence of cadmium in the reactor
   feed, manganese removal could be increased to 56\%. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A new method to determine the readily fermentable organic fraction in
   municipal wastewater has been developed. A simple batch procedure was
   used to measure the VFA potential, i.e. the sum of the volatile fatty
   acids (VFA) originally present in the wastewater and the amount of VFA
   that can be formed through fermentation of other organic wastewater
   constituents. The VFA potential represents the maximum amount of VFA,
   the principal substrate for polyphosphate accumulating bacteria, that
   can be made available to these bacteria in the anaerobic stage of an
   enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) process. The batch
   procedure is based on a spontaneous fermentation of organic matter in
   the wastewater until the fermentable organic matter is depleted,
   followed by measurement of the concentration of VFA. A comparison
   between two different municipal wastewaters, exhibiting different ratios
   between the VFA potential and the phosphorus content of the wastewater,
   showed a clear correlation between a high value of this ratio and a good
   performance of EBPR. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A mixture of four different anaerobic sludges was tested for the ability
   to transform varying concentrations (0.3-2.2 mg l(-1)) of
   trichloroethene (TCE) under groundwater conditions with methanol,
   ethanol, formate, lactate, acetate and H-2/CO2 as reducing substrates.
   Seven fixed-bed reactors were operated from the start at 14 degrees C
   over a period of 200 days. With lactate, TCE was completely transformed
   to cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) within 12 days. With formate,
   methanol, acetate, H-2/CO2 and ethanol, more than 75\% of the TCE was
   dechlorinated to cis-DCE within 24, 75, 144, 84 and 190 days,
   respectively. With mixtures of substrates, nearly complete
   transformation after 13 days and significant methane production could
   only be obtained with lactate + methanol, but not with formate +
   methanol. After the feed was changed to methanol only, transformation
   efficiency of TCE was still high and methane production increased in the
   reactor previously fed with lactate + methanol. In a column reactor fed
   with lactate for more than 100 days, TCE transformation could not be
   maintained at 100\% efficiency and methane production was insignificant
   when only methanol was fed. The formation of other dichlorinated

Abstract = {{A 1.8 m diameter vertical axis upflow impeller and draft tube
   arrangement is proposed for circulating water bodies such as reservoirs
   and lakes so as to maintain oxic, destratified conditions throughout the
   water column. Tests were conducted on a 1/6 scale model (i) to verify
   theoretical predictions of flow rate and power consumption and (ii) to
   compare the performance of the impeller in a draft tube with that of the
   same impeller without a draft tube as used in recent full-scale tests in
   reservoirs. The model test results support theoretical predictions that
   by using very low flow velocities of the order of 0.2-0.4 m/s, a
   prototype could achieve a flow rate of the order of 1 m(3)/s with about
   200 W of hydraulic power in the presence of a weak thermocline, or 130 W
   with no thermocline. This is a much lower specific energy consumption
   than for any mechanical mixer hitherto reported in the literature, and
   results indicate that in about 12 days, with 200 W input power, a
   reservoir of 1000 megalitres (ML) Capacity could be fully circulated or
   the water above a certain level in a larger reservoir could be
   circulated so as to maintain dissolved oxygen above that level. It is
   argued that oxic conditions are best maintained by circulating water
   from lower levels to the surface where it will become oxygenated by
   natural processes of diffusion, photosynthesis and wind and wave action,
   rather than by mixing, which consumes energy through turbulence and does
   not per se add oxygen. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Biogas hydrogen content varies with the operational conditions of an
   anaerobic digester, and may be a useful control parameter. Experiments
   were carried out on a laboratory scale fluidised bed anaerobic digester,
   fed with a synthetic baker's yeast wastewater. Step overloads produced a
   sharp peak in biogas hydrogen level measured on-line, e.g. an increase
   of loading rate from 40 to 63 kg COD m(-3) day(-1) increased hydrogen
   concentration from 290 to 640 ppm within 3 h. However, switching from an
   older, partly acidified batch to a fresh batch of feed at constant COD
   gave a marked increase in the biogas hydrogen content from 200 to 800
   ppm. In these studies propionic acid and biogas hydrogen concentrations
   were not linearly correlated. According to the present results, biogas
   hydrogen content is unsuitable as a stand-alone control variable for
   anaerobic digestion, but its rapid response and ease of on-line
   measurement supports its use in digester control along with other liquid
   phase parameters to be measured on-line. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Taking samples at eight points chosen from two conventional water
   treatment plants for the city of Salamanca, the formation and evolution
   of THM levels were studied on 11 different dates. The values obtained
   were correlated statistically with the following parameters:
   concentration of humic acids (only raw water), pre- and postchlorination
   dosages, UV absorbance (UV-254), pH and temperature. No statistical
   correlation was observed either with the humic acids content or with the
   organic matter measured as UV-254. A correlation was only found with the
   prechlorination dosage in the clarifiers of the old plant. However, in
   both plants there was a correlation with the postchlorination dosage
   although this was not very patent owing to the impossibility of knowing
   the contribution of each parameter at one of the sampling sites where
   postchlorination and pH correction are performed simultaneously. A clear
   linear correlation (r = 0.4345, P = 0.0001) was observed with
   temperature. Using stepwise regression (ANCOVA) a mathematical function
   was obtained (R = 0.8066, P = 0.0001) that relates the concentration of
   chloroform with temperature and the sampling points; From this it is
   deduced that both pH and temperature increase this concentration,
   although for each pH value all the In CHCl3 (mu g/l) vs temperature
   curves showed a maximum (T-c = 18.97 degrees C), after which chloroform
   levels decrease sharply. On attempting to quantify the contribution of
   the rest of the parameters studied here concerning the levels of THMs,
   it may be inferred that others should be considered, such as the design,
   the dimensions and the exploitation of the water treatment plants
   studied. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption of the polar herbicides thiazafluron
   (1,3-dimethyl-1-(5-trifluoromethyl-1,3,4-diazol-2-yl)urea) and
   metamitron (4-amino-4,5-dihydro-3-methyl-6-phenyl-1,2,4-triazin-5-one)
   in the aqueous suspension of five soils of southern Spain, their
   respective clay fractions (with diverse organic carbon content and clay
   mineralogy) and model pure clay minerals has been monitored as an
   integrated study to assess the role of the diverse colloidal soil
   components and their solid/solution ratio, as relevant to the transport
   of contaminants by particulate matter in water. Adsorption isotherms
   obtained were analysed and fitted to the logarithmic form of the
   Freundlich equation and adsorption coefficients Kr calculated.
   Thiazafluron adsorbs on soils, soil clays and model mineral sorbents to
   a higher extent than the herbicide metamitron due to their different
   molecular structure. The sorption of both herbicides in clay fractions
   increases with decreasing solid/solution ratio. The highest Kr value al
   high solid/solution ratio for both herbicides is found in a saline soil
   with its clay fraction predominantly composed of an altered illite
   mineral which behaves as a montmorillonite. Thiazafluron and metamitron
   also show the highest adsorption capacity (at low solid/solution ratio)
   on a predominantly montmorillonitic clay fraction of low cation exchange
   capacity (CEC), whereas low adsorption is found on a montmorillonitic
   clay fraction of high CEC. The negative influence of the clay CEC is
   confirmed in adsorption studies on pure clay minerals suspensions. The
   sorption of both herbicides by soil clays after removing organic matter
   (OM), shows that contribution of the colloidal OM is very low for
   thiazafluon, although rather important for metamitron. The influence of
   the different nature of the OM associated to the clay fractions of
   diverse soils is suggested. The mineral components of the soil clays,
   especially expandable layer silicates such as montmorillonite and a type
   of altered illite, are revealed to be responsible for the adsorption and
   hence the transport of these polar herbicides by waters in contact with
   soils or fine-size soil separates. Not only the relative amounts of the
   organic and inorganic components are important, but also the surface
   properties and the accessibility of the functional active groups of the
   herbicide molecule to those surfaces. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Lampropedia spp. is a Gram-negative, Neisser-positive coccus that was
   isolated from EBPR (enhanced biological phosphate removal) activated
   sludge laboratory plants operating on dairy and piggery wastewaters. In
   aerobic growth tests carried out on sodium acetate, Lampropedia spp.
   stored PHB up to 12\% w/w. Biomass yield was estimated at 0.55 g
   VSS.g(-1) HAc and specific growth rate at 0.045 h(-1). The experimental
   maximum acetic acid removal rate was 71.86 mg HAc.g(-1) VSS.h(-1) with a
   semisaturation constant of 71.78 mg.l(-1). Batch tests were carried out
   to check whether Lampropedia spp. was capable of enhanced biological
   phosphorus removal. Under anaerobic conditions, Lampropedia spp.
   sequestered acetate and stored PHB with an average conversion factor of
   0.33 mg PHB.mg(-1) HAc. The measured maximum PHB storage capacity was
   31\% w/w, with a maximum specific PHB accumulation rate of 17 mg
   PHB.g(-1) VSS.h(-1) and a specific anaerobic acetate uptake rate of 57
   mg HAc.g(-1) VSS.h(-1). The experimental ratio between phosphorus
   released and acetate taken up was low, on average 0.044 mg PO4-P.mg(-1)
   HAc, with a specific rate ranging from 1.7 to 3.6 mg PO4-P.g(-1)
   VSS.h(-1) at pH. 7.5. Despite the low figure, fractionation analyses
   showed that in anaerobic conditions the released phosphate comes from
   cell polyphosphate degradation. Therefore, all the results allow us to
   conclude that Lampropedia spp. can be classified amongst the phosphorus
   accumulating bacteria. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Concerning the transfer of energy from the mechanical aerator to the
   liquid in an aeration tank, new relationships between the oxygen mass
   transfer rate, the aerator diameter, its relational velocity and the
   volume of the aerated liquid, have been proposed by the author of this
   paper. Therefore, according to the power consumption of the aerator,
   three parameters characterizing the oxygen mass transfer process have
   been defined by the author. These are the active volume, the energy
   transfer area and the mass transfer area. Meanwhile, an ideal mechanical
   aerator has been defined as a hypothetical aerator for which the volume
   generated by the spinning of the aerator is equal to the active volume
   corresponding to the potential energy transferred by the aerator. The
   new relationships between the oxygen mass transfer rate, the aerator
   diameter, its rotational velocity and the aerated volume were determined
   by the author for both ideal aerators and the real aerators used in full
   scale processes. It has been proven, on the basis of these
   relationships, that for an aerator of given geometrical shape there is
   both a unique rotational velocity and aerated volume for which the
   transfer efficiency is optimum. The correlation between the experimental
   results and theoretical data, generated using specific mathematical
   formulas which express the dependence of the oxygen mass transfer rate
   on the power consumption, has been established. New relationships are
   proposed for scaling. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The significance of the presence in drinking water of the protozoan
   microparasites Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia for public
   health may be analyzed by means of risk assessment. This requires
   quantitative knowledge of all the contributing factors, from the
   concentration of these organisms in the source water to the
   dose-response relation for the probability of infection or disease in a
   human host. The major contributing factors are: the concentration of
   cysts or oocysts in raw water, the recovery of the detection method, the
   viability of recovered cysts or oocysts, the removal of organisms in the
   treatment process, and the daily consumption of unboiled tap water. To
   enable analysis of the uncertainty in the calculated risk of infection,
   each of these factors is treated as a stochastic variable, for which a
   suitable distribution is proposed. A frequency distribution for the
   probability of infection is then constructed with standard sampling
   techniques. This first evaluation of the calculation of the risk of
   infection due to exposure to Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts
   via drinking water, shows that the uncertainty in the estimated removal
   efficiency of the treatment process dominates over uncertainties in
   other contributing factors. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The technique of precipitation from homogeneous solutions was used in
   this study to simulate the formation of iron(III) hydroxides under
   conditions similar to those at the redox boundary of natural waters. The
   technique allowed the precipitation of iron(III) hydroxides to occur,
   while the precipitant iron(III) was generated very slowly by the
   oxygenation of iron(II) and, subsequently, hydrolyzed. During the
   precipitation, pH heterogeneity did not occur locally as was usually
   observed in the conventional preparation of iron(III) hydroxides in the
   laboratory (e.g. addition of a base to an acidic solution of iron(III)).
   Thus, the rapid hydrolysis and the extensive polymerization of iron(III)
   hydroxides were effectively prevented, particularly at the early stage
   of the precipitation. The iron(III) precipitates formed in this way are
   more representative of iron(III) hydroxides occurring particularly at
   the redox boundary of natural waters than those formed by the
   conventional procedure in the laboratory. The effects of various
   solutes, such as H4SiO4, H2PO4- and oxalate which commonly occur in
   natural waters, on the composition, size and shape of the iron(III)
   hydroxides formed have also been studied. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of Escherichia coli inactivation with ozone were
   investigated with semi-batch and continuous-flow tubular reactors in
   solutions buffered with phosphate at pH 6 and 8, temperatures ranging
   from 5 to 25 degrees C, and in the presence (0.01 hr) and absence of
   radical scavenger tert-butanol. Ozone concentrations and contact times
   investigated ranged from 6 to 41 mu g/l, and 1.8-33s, respectively.
   Inactivation kinetics were found to be first-order with respect to both
   ozone concentration and active microorganism density. The overall
   second-order rate constant was 130 l/(mg s) at 20 degrees C, and the
   corresponding activation energy was 37,100 J/mol. Experimental results
   corresponding to tests performed at pH 6 and 8, and in the presence
   (0.01 M) and absence of radical scavenger tert-butanol, confirmed that
   dissolved molecular ozone was primarily responsible for E. coli
   inactivation in the range of experimental conditions investigated. (C)

Abstract = {{Three different analytical methods for the determination of low
   concentrations of H2O2 in surface and tap water were compared. A flow
   injection method based on the enzymatic catalyzed reduction of H2O2 in
   the presence of p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (POHPAA) and with a
   fluorometric registration of the resulting fluorochrome exhibited lowest
   limits of detection (0.2 mu g . l(-1)) and of determination (0.8 mu g .
   l(-1)). The photometric determination of H2O2 by the
   peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of N,N-diethyl-p-phenylendiamine (DPD
   method) was less sensitive, while the procedure based on the photometry
   of the complex formed with titanyl oxalate was insensitive for H2O2
   concentrations lower than 24 mu g . l(-1). Ozone and chlorine (oxidants
   used in drinking-water treatment) and dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   interfere in the formation of the fluorescence intensity signal. Ozone
   was shown to generate H2O2 in aqueous solutions containing
   p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and peroxidase. In order to determine the
   concentration of H2O2 in this case, the fluorescence caused by the
   amount of freshly generated H2O2 should be estimated in a separate
   experiment and should be subtracted from the total fluorescence
   intensity signal. Also determinations of water containing DOM should be
   corrected for the emission of fluorescence caused by the DOM itself. (C)

   exchangeable Na, K and Ca ions but exposing them to 2 M NaCl solution at
   22 and 70 degrees C, respectively, converted them to a near homoionic
   state in Na-form. Lead and cadmium removal results using natural
   zeolites and treated zeolites showed that treatment improved both the
   exchange capacity and the removal efficiency. The influence of the
   temperature on the ion-exchange process was examined. It was found that
   the metal uptake was increased with increasing temperature during the
   ion-exchange process. Natural and modified zeolites remove toxic metals
   from waste waters. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The toxicity of the by-products found in water disinfected by
   chlorination methods prompted the regulatory agencies to insist on the
   use of alternative, ecologically friendly methods. This paper presents
   new disinfection techniques developed in our laboratory, which use
   sunlight or artificial UV radiation to promote photochemical
   disinfection processes. The sunlight was either used as global
   irradiation or concentrated by mirrors via an intermediary
   photosensitizer dissolved in water. Under these conditions the sunlight
   produces oxidative species in water which kill the microorganisms and
   oxidize organic materials. The disinfection efficiency of these methods
   has been proven in two experimental pilot plants operating in a
   continuous process with outputs of 50 and 0.15 m(3) h(-1), and retention
   times of 35 min and 3 s, respectively. The former process is
   economically competitive and is ready for practical use, especially in
   countries with high solar radiation Aux densities. Data about a
   potential industrial application of concentrated solar radiation for
   detoxification of industrial wastewater polluted by a pesticide
   (bromacil) are presented. A new technique was used for UV (254 nm) water
   disinfection; it employs custom-designed elliptical UV reflectors which
   concentrate the radiation on a UV-transparent pipe through which the
   wastewater hows. The 5 m(3) h(-1) laboratory installation provided
   efficient disinfection of wastewater with turbidities up to 20 NTU. For
   large UV water disinfection plants (> 100 m(3) h(-1)), a new design is
   proposed, which could replace the present gravitational systems. (C)

Title = {{Formation, evolution and modeling of trihalomethanes in the drinking

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Six sampling points located at different distances, two by two
   (near-far), from the three main supply reservoirs, were selected in the
   distribution system of the drinking water network of the city of
   Salamanca in order to follow the evolution of trihalomethanes (THMs).
   Data obtained were correlated statistically with the chlorination
   dosages in the treatment plants and the distribution system, the
   distances run by the water, residual free chlorine and total chlorine,
   the total organic carbon (TOC), pH and temperature. The prechlorination
   dosage did not correlate strongly (P = 0.1268) with chloroform content
   at the first point of the distribution system, while that of
   postchlorination and rechlorination did not correlate at all. The
   organic matter, measured as the TOC, showed a positive correlation (P =
   0.0322), with a consumption of free chlorine (R = -0.327, P = 0.0190)
   and total chlorine (R = -0.290, P = 0.0393) that was proportional to the
   content in THMs. However, the distance among the six points of the
   distribution system-an approximate means of estimating the reaction
   time-yielded conflicting results. Temperature and pH proved to be the
   parameters with the strongest influence. Temperature alone did not show
   linear dependence, while pH did (R = 0.665, P = 0.0001), showing a
   dramatic increase in THM levels on two sampling dates with exceptionally
   high pH levels. Functions of these two parameters permitted the
   elaboration of a predictive mathematical model (R = 0.995, P < 0.0001)
   in which increasing values of pH and temperature are seen to increase
   the level of chloroform up to a given temperature value (T-c = 17.30
   degrees C) after which a sharp decrease in the chloroform content
   occurs. This value was comparable with that obtained with a similar
   model in the finished water treatment plants. A global modeling of both
   systems (treatment plants and distribution system) was also possible (R
   = 0.827, P = 0.0001), with a T-c value of 18.74 degrees C for each pH.

Abstract = {{In storm waterways and at dam outlets, high-velocity supercritical flows
   are characterized by substantial air bubble entrainment. The entrainment
   of fine air bubbles and the strong turbulent mixing contribute both to
   the air-water transfer of volatile gases (e.g. oxygen, nitrogen, VOC).
   The paper describes new experimental data obtained in a 25 m long
   channel with a 4 degrees slope. The analysis of the data provides new
   information on the air-water how properties and on the distributions
   air-water interface area. Although the amount of entrained air is small
   (i.e. typically C-mean < 0.12), the specific air-water interface area
   can reach over 100 m(2) per unit volume of air and water. The results
   are compared with an earlier prediction (Chanson, 1994) and confirm the
   significant contribution of air entrainment to air-water gas transfer in
   supercritical chute flows. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   Th, Ti, V, Zn and Zr concentrations in alluvial sediments were
   determined by INAA and OES in the area used as a garbage disposal site
   in the vicinity of a water-well field. Results show that total
   concentrations of analysed elements depend on sediment characteristics:
   mineral composition, specific surface area, cation exchange capacity,
   organic matter and clay-grain size fraction content. On the other hand,
   concentrations in sediment depend on physico-chemical forms and
   geochemical characteristics of the elements in question. Most of the
   elements reveal excellent/very good correlations with iron, while
   strontium shows negative correlation with iron. Strontium has a very
   good, positive correlation with carbonate content, while all other
   analysed elements, except silver, have excellent negative correlations
   with carbonates. Correlations with clay-grain size fraction are good or
   very good for all elements, except strontium and silver. The only
   element which is not correlated, either with iron, carbonate, or with
   clay-grain size fraction is silver. One can conclude, therefore, that
   silver is introduced as discrete particles. Extremely high silver
   concentration was found 6.5-6.8 m below the garbage in the aerated
   layer, occasionally under the water table. The enrichment factor for
   silver is found to be 127, which is a clear indication of sediment
   pollution with silver. Long-lasting clandestine deposition of industrial
   wastes on a disposal site meant for domestic wastes might be the reason.
   The elevated concentrations found on the 11.2-11.4 m depth are
   concordant with mineralogical composition (MnO-hydroxides, iron
   minerals, illite, chlorite) and enrichment factors for the majority of
   analysed elements are below 2. For the time being, this sediment layer
   acts as a chemical filter preventing infiltration in the vertical
   direction. Concentrations and enrichment factors of all determined
   elements from the uppermost and deeper water bearing layers are of
   natural values. Taking into account these, and additional, piezometer
   results, it can be concluded that the quality of water taken from the
   water-well field downstream of the garbage disposal site is not
   endangered so far. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In acetate-fed, anaerobic-aerobic alternated bioreactors, the P/C
   feeding ratio (wt/wt) was found to be a key factor influencing an
   `'internal energy-based'' competition between polyphosphate-accumulating
   bacteria (PAB) that mediate biological phosphorus removal and
   glycogen-accumulating bacteria (GAP) that do not. Both groups were
   previously known to use internally stored polyphosphate and glycogen,
   respectively, as energy sources for storing acetate as
   polyhydroxyalkanoate in the anaerobic stage, and to use the reserved
   material for growth in the aerobic stage. When excessive P was provided
   (P/C feeding ratio = 20/100), PAB could accumulate a high content of
   polyphosphate, and with a higher and faster acetate uptake ability,
   successfully out-competed GAB. In contrast, reduction of the P/C ratio
   to 2/100 caused the depletion of the polyphosphate content in PAB,
   eventually leading to a replacement by GAB as the majority. Stable
   coexistence of both groups occurred under operation with a median P/C
   ratio, because the stored energy pool of PAB was not enough for the
   complete uptake of acetate under anaerobic conditions. Thus, GAB could
   share what acetate remained, coexisting with PAB. These competitive
   outcomes were strongly supported by results on the anaerobic metabolism
   of acetate, and by microscopic observations in this study. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Previous work had demonstrated that TNT, a widespread hazardous waste,
   is effectively mineralized in aerated TiO2 slurries using near-UV
   radiation. However, prior work failed to evaluate the reaction under
   conditions likely to be encountered in field applications. The present
   study was undertaken to examine the impact of pH and the presence of
   inorganic ions and organic acids commonly found in natural waters on
   rates of TiO2 photocatalyzed TNT transformation and mineralization.
   Raising the pH slightly increased the rate of TNT transformation,
   primarily as a result of an increased rate of TNT photolysis, but
   significantly reduced rates of mineralization due to increased
   electrostatic repulsion between the catalyst surface and anionic TNT
   intermediates. The presence of inorganic anions did not substantially
   hinder TNT transformation at alkaline pH, but mineralization rates were
   diminished when the anion either adsorbed strongly to the photocatalyst
   or was an effective hydroxyl radical scavenger. Addition of humic acid
   to the solution matrix did not alter the net rate of TNT transformation,
   but did decrease the overall decay rate of dissolved organic carbon. The
   propensity of humic acid to transform TNT through sensitized
   photocatalysis, and the importance of this reaction in overall compound
   degradation, were also assessed. Data indicated that humic acids can
   serve to sensitize TiO2 photocatalytic degradation of TNT, but under the
   aerated solution conditions of this work rates of humic sensitized
   photolysis were higher than rates of sensitized photocatalysis. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{One of the methods for domestic wastewater disposal in the Florida Keys
   is injection of partially treated wastewater into the highly porous
   limestone bedrock using waste disposal or injection wells. In an effort
   to understand the transport and fate of wastewater, we utilized
   bacteriophages as tracers in a 12.2-m deep, simulated injection well in
   Key Largo and an active (27.4 m deep) class V disposal well in the
   Middle Keys. The latter is the currently permitted type of injection
   well used for multi-unit domestic waste disposal in the Keys. Surface
   waters and groundwater at several sites were monitored for 5 days after
   seeding of the injection wells. In both environments, viral tracers
   appeared after short periods of time in groundwater (8 h after
   injection) and surface marine waters (10 h and 53 h for Key Largo and
   the Middle Keys, respectively). Estimated rates of tracer movement were
   greatest in Key Largo (2.5-35 m/h), where tidal pumping was implicated
   in tracer movement. In the Middle Keys, the pattern of movement showed
   little evidence of tidal pumping, and migration rates were slower
   (0.12-2 m/h). Collectively these results indicate that wastewater
   injected into the subsurface can make its way rapidly to surface marine
   waters, where it may contribute to water quality deterioration. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Organochlorine levels (PCBs and pesticides) were determined by high
   resolution gas chromatography (HRCG) in the roach and in the water from
   stations of the River Seine with different pollution levels, in spring
   and autumn. An inverse relationship between size and pollutant levels
   was shown in the roach from highly polluted stations (p less than or
   equal to 0.001) but failed to be found at the slightly polluted ones. No
   changes in the PCB pattern were found in relation to the size, either in
   fish from the highly polluted sites or in fish from the slightly
   polluted ones. At both types of sites, a fall of the PCB contents
   occurred in spring as compared to those of autumn; this appears to be in
   relation to spawning. Concerning the PCB pattern, PCB 153 and PCB 101
   are classically the major components found in both the commercial
   mixtures and the roach. The mono-orthosubstituted and the less
   chlorinated components showed much lower levels in the roach than in the
   commercial mixtures; this appears to be in accordance with the high
   metabolic induction ability of those types of congeners. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Nitroglycerin (C3H5(ONO2)(3)) or glycerol trinitrate (GTN), a
   constituent of various propellant formulations and a vasodilator
   prescribed to treat angina pectoris and other heart diseases, was
   completely mineralized in serum vials under strict anaerobiosis by mixed
   cultures from an anaerobic digester. Anaerobic biodegradation occurred
   via successive denitration of the parent molecule and production of
   glycerol dinitrate (GDN), and glycerol mononitrate (GMN), which was
   converted to a utilizable carbon source, most likely glycerol. Both
   isomeric forms of GDN were detected, namely glycerol 1,3-dinitrate
   (1,3-GDN) and glycerol 1,2-dinitrate (1,2-GDN), which were converted to
   glycerol 1-mononitrate (1-GMN) and glycerol 2-mononitrate (2-GMN).
   Significant regioselectivity of the enzymatic degradation was observed
   with preferential attack at the secondary (C2) nitro group, which
   favored production of 1,3-GDN and 1-GMN. Addition of cosubstrates
   substantially enhanced the rates of conversion of GTN; however,
   biodegradation also occurred in the absence of external carbon sources.
   The rates of biodegradation were significantly decreased at each
   successive denitration, with conversion of GMN to glycerol being the
   rate limiting step. The destruction of the GDN and GMN intermediates,
   which are more soluble than the parent compound, and possibly more toxic
   and mutagenic, is extremely important for the treatment of wastewater
   and soils contaminated with GTN. Nitrate and nitrite, the main nitrogen
   products of denitration, were also removed under anaerobic conditions.

Abstract = {{Air-water partitioning data for a wide range of organic chemicals are
   used to validate a three-variable quantitative structure-activity
   relationship (QSAR) model for Henry's law constant, H. The predictive
   ability of the basic model, developed from a training set of 180
   chemicals, is now demonstrated on 105 new chemicals of similar molecular
   structure. This basic model is then extended to cover additional
   chemicals of diverse molecular features. The predictive ability of the
   final model is demonstrated on a new testing set of 70 chemicals
   featuring multiple structural components and polyfunctional groups.
   Spanning over 10 orders of magnitude, the log H values predicted by the
   QSAR model for 462 compounds are found to agree with the reported
   experimental values with r(2) > 0.95 at p = 0.0005. A new QSAR model for
   estimating H as a function of temperature, T, is also proposed. The
   predictive ability of this H-T model is demonstrated using experimental
   data for 18 chemicals over a temperature range of 10-55 degrees C. (C)

Abstract = {{The transportation of triazines (atrazine, simazine, ametryne and
   cyanazine) was investigated in an experimental catchment basin situated
   in an agricultural area. It focused on the surface and groundwaters from
   March 1991 to December 1993. In addition, the phenylureas (isoproturon,
   linuron, diuron and chlortoluron) were studied in the surface waters
   from January 1992 to December 1993. So as to assess the evolution of
   water contamination by triazines and phenylureas during the survey
   period, the herbicide concentrations were considered together with the
   characteristic parameters of the catchment basin: types of cultivations,
   flows and precipitations. The main herbicides found in the stream of
   Fosse Rognon during our study were the atrazine (30-2450 ng/l), the
   simazine (10-1880 ng/l) and the isoproturon (10-1800 ng/l). The results,
   obtained from the stream, show that the contamination overstepped the
   application periods. The precipitations play a major part in the
   herbicide leaching after their application. In the groundwaters, the
   atrazine concentration (5-1700 ng/l) and the simazine concentration
   (5-1120 ng/l) were higher than those found in 1977, despite a reduction
   of the corn cultivated areas. The only degradation product of atrazine
   found in both the surface and the groundwaters was desethylatrazine
   (10-850 ng/l). It appears that the groundwaters were the main incoming
   sources of desethylatrazine to surface waters. The exportation balances
   by the stream of Fosse Rognon, expressed as a percentage of the applied
   amounts, were for atrazine, simazine and isoproturon, in 1992: 0.085,
   0.18 and 0.035, and in 1993: 0.28, 0.3 and 0.083, respectively. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Bacteria differ in their abilities to degrade hydrophobic xenobiotic
   compounds which are associated with solid sorbents and nonaqueous phase
   liquids (NAPLs) in the environment. Here, we assess the bioavailability
   of naphthalene sorbed to forest soils, river sediment, and a variety of
   synthetic sorbents to two bacterial species studied previously using
   agricultural soils as sorbents. Using a mineralization kinetics
   approach, we determined that, for an Alcaligenes sp. (strain NP-Alk),
   sorbed naphthalene was unavailable for degradation and slow desorption
   limited the extent of mineralization in all sorbent systems. Pseudomonas
   putida strain 17484 had direct and immediate access to a portion of the
   sorbed naphthalene associated with all natural sorbents and facilitated
   the desorption of additional naphthalene for degradation. Naphthalene
   associated with forest soils was less available than naphthalene sorbed
   to agricultural soils or river sediments. Aging soil-naphthalene
   slurries (up to 3 yr equilibration) progressively diminished both the
   rate and extent of naphthalene degradation by strain 17484. Exposure of
   soil interior sorption sites by sonication of 3 yr old slurries
   increased naphthalene availability to this organism. Differential access
   to surface-sorbed naphthalene in soil studies, due to the attachment
   propensities of the two organisms, accounted for the observed
   bioavailability results. Sorption to granular activated carbon (GAC)
   virtually precluded naphthalene degradation by either organism, whereas
   naphthalene sorbed to XAD-2 resin, hexadecyltrimethylammonium
   (HDTMA)-modified smectite and Tenax was more rapidly desorbed and
   degraded in studies with strain 17484. The porosities and naphthalene
   binding characteristics of the sorbents appeared to control
   bioavailability. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A simple and inexpensive continuous fixed-bed reactor is introduced in
   order to investigate the anaerobic biodegradability of water-soluble
   substances and products as well as wastewater. The bioreactor tube is
   equipped with a polyester fleece that is soaked with anaerobic sludge.
   The solution of the test substance or wastewater is pumped into the
   thermostated bioreactor. The biogas evolved is pumped into a glass tube
   containing a solution of sodium hydroxide to absorb carbon dioxide. The
   anaerobic biodegradability of the test substance can be determined with
   the methane Volume evolved and the theoretical maximum amount of
   methane, which is calculated from the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of
   the test substance. The test system can also be used to enrich
   refractory compounds. A validation of the test system is shown with
   glucose and benzoic acid, which have been degraded to about 90\%. Sodium
   lauryl sulfate was only degraded to about 15\%. It was shown that the
   desulfonated test substance (dodecanol) was adsorbed to the sludge. (C)

Abstract = {{The effects of pH and moisture content on high-solids sludge digestion
   were investigated using a mesophilic batch digester fed with sludge
   cake. The experiments were carried out by changing the initial moisture
   contents from 90 to 96\% and the initial pH from 5.0 to 10.0. A simple
   model developed from the Gompertz equation was applied to estimate the
   methane production rate and the lag-phase time under various conditions,
   based on the cumulative methane production curves. The relative
   methanogenic activity decreased with the decrease of moisture content
   and dropped from 100 to 53\% when the moisture content decreased from 96
   to 90\%. The rate of the methane production of the high-solids digestion
   at moisture contents of 90 to 96\% functioned over a range of 6.6-7.8
   with an optimum of pH 6.8, whereas the process may fail if the pH is
   lower than 6.1 or higher than 8.3. Moreover, a minimum lag-phase time
   for methane production was also found at around pH 6.8. In addition, a
   modified Haldane equation was suitable to represent the effect of pH on
   methanogenic activity at various moisture contents. The maximum specific
   methane production rate, K-m, and the saturation rate constants for
   hydrogen ion, K-H, and hydroxyl ion, K-OH, were 14.5-7.5 ml CH.g(-1) dry
   weight.d(-1), 5.0 x 10(-1)-8.0 x 10(-1) {[}M] and 2.0 x 10(-9)-8.0 x

Abstract = {{Lake Stechlin sediment layers were dated and analysed for PCDD/F. The
   concentrations of PCDD/F in the investigated sediment have increased by
   a factor of about 100 since the last century and have decreased by a
   factor of two since the 1970s. The latter finding can be confirmed by
   recent temporal trends in human samples and herring-gull eggs. The
   homologue patterns especially for PCDF are subject to temporal
   variations and can be mainly related to municipal waste incineration and
   the impact of the precursor PCB. The overall time trend corresponds
   roughly with the anthropogenic world-wide production of chlorine. (C)

   conditions. The concentration of VFAs decreased with irradiation time,
   indicating pseudo-first-order kinetics. The rates were in the range
   13.6-3.5 (x 10(-3)) min(-1) under argon. Saturated gas affected the
   degradation rate and the order of the rates was as follows: nitrogen
   less than or equal to air < argon. Mixing effects (in the presence of
   other VFAs) were found to have little influence upon the degradation of

Abstract = {{Sewage sludge usually contains significant heavy metals that may limit
   its land application. Heavy metals in municipal solid waste have been
   shown to be less mobile by amendment with bauxite refining residue (red
   mud) prior to the composting process. In the present research a
   sequential step extraction was employed to investigate metal speciation
   (into exchangeable, bound to carbonate, to Mn and Fe oxides, to organic
   matter and in residue phase) and the effect of red mud on metal
   speciation in compost of sewage sludge for Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. The
   effect of red mud addition and composting process on metal distribution
   in sewage sludge compost is significant. Red mud addition generally
   reduces metal leachability and therefore the potential hazard of
   releasing metals from sludge compost through adsorption and complexation
   of the metals on to inorganic components to different extents for the
   different metals. Red mud cannot desorb, however, metals bound to
   organic matter in the sludge. The composting process breaks down organic
   matter in the sludge and may release the heavy metals. The addition of
   red mud prior to the sludge composting binds the released metals on to
   the red mud for those not strongly readsorbed by the remaining organics
   (Cu, Ni and Zn). (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of effluent composition on the efficiency of the hydroxide
   precipitation of Zn2+ modelling lime (CaO) as a precipitant has been
   predicted using the solubility domain approach and experimentally

   to be solubility limiting for systems representing potential effluent
   chemical composition limits. All such phases were found to resemble
   their mineralized counterparts with a lower degree of structural order.
   The generated solubility domains generally encompassed the
   experimentally observed solubilities, thus providing effluent treatment
   quality assurance ranges for the hydroxide precipitation process. The
   presence of calcite (CaCO3) and gypsum (CaSO4.2H(2)O) as secondary
   precipitates had little effect on the observed residual zinc
   solubilities. Validation of the solubility domain approach using real
   industrial wastewater was accomplished. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   It is based on a review of methods suggested by other researchers in

   the actual air composition in the measuring unit and the degree of
   supersaturation of air in the water leaving the measuring unit are taken
   into consideration. A complete mathematical description for determining
   the saturator efficiency from the measured data Is given based on
   Henry's law and molar or mass balances across the measuring bottle. The
   calculation procedure provides a clear picture of how the concentrations
   of oxygen and nitrogen in air and water change through the whole

Abstract = {{Heavy metal interaction with anaerobically digested sludge was
   investigated using copper, cadmium and nickel chloride salt solutions.
   The behaviour of the well-known glycine-metal aqueous system was
   compared with the behaviour of the sludge-metal system. When equilibrium
   pH values are presented against the initial metal concentration fur the
   glycine-copper system the profile obtained shows a sharp peak. This
   behaviour is similar to the behaviour of the experimental sludge-copper
   system. The peak also appears for cadmium and nickel-glycine systems.
   However, it is not as pronounced as in the glycine-copper system and
   cannot be observed in the sludge-metal systems. The similar behaviour of
   both copper systems suggests that the metal binding mechanism of the
   sludge involves amino acid functional groups which are present in the
   cell wall. Due to this similarity, an apparent molarity of the sludge
   can be evaluated by sludge titration with copper (II). The value
   obtained can be expressed as mmols of equivalent glycine per gram of
   sludge. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The persistence of cyanobacterial hepatotoxin, microcystin-LR, was
   investigated in Lake Tuusulanjarvi in southern Finland from August to
   October, 1993 and 1994. The amount of toxin in particulate material and
   dissolved in water were determined by HPLC from samples collected from
   mesocosm enclosures and from the surrounding lake water. In the
   beginning of the experiments over 80\% of the phytoplankton biomass
   consisted of cyanobacteria. The main species were Microcystis
   wesenbergii (Chroococcales, Cyanobacteria), M. viridis and M.
   aeruginosa. The microcystin-LR concentration in particulate material
   varied from 2.7 to 3.2 mu g l(-1) and the corresponding concentration of
   microcystin LR dissolved in water from 0.06 to 0.21 mu gl(-1). The
   cyanobacterial biomass decreased towards the middle of September and
   simultaneously the microcystin concentration in freeze dried particulate
   material decreased below the detection limit of 10 mu g g(-1),
   corresponding 0.01 mu gl(-1). Dissolved microcystin-LR was detected in a
   concentration range of 1 to 5 ng l(-1) even at the end of the
   experiments in October, when the cyanobacterial biomass was less than 1
   mg l(-1). Thus, dissolved microcystin was more persistent compared to
   microcystin in particulate material: the decimal reduction time for
   dissolved toxin was 30 d and for toxin in particulate material about 15
   d. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A fast and easy test procedure was developed to check if a wastewater
   containing biorefractory substances can be efficiently treated in a
   combined biological-chemical process. Efficient treatment is
   characterized by a minimum use of expensive chemical oxidant, e.g.
   ozone, for a specified removal. The degree of removal of DOC and COD can
   be obtained characterizing the general feasibility of the combined
   treatment. Additionally, the approximate amount of ozone needed for a
   specified removal of DOC (Delta O-3/Delta DOC)(all) is obtained allowing
   preliminary cost estimation. The test procedure used a barometric BOD5
   method for the biological removal of biodegradable compounds and simple
   batch ozonation experiments to oxidize organic compounds. Wastewater
   with high ammonia content was initially treated in nitrifying fluidized
   bed bioreactor. The established procedure was successfully tested with
   the model substance nz-chloronitrobenzene (mCNB) and applied to landfill
   leachate. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   The results of nitrification experiments revealed that both particle and

   of 500 mu m) was employed, the complete ammonium oxidation was attained
   at a high ammonium loading rate of 12 kg-N.m(-3)-carrier.d(-1) at 25
   degrees C. In the nitrification using 5 mm cubic carrier, the
   accumulation of ammonium and nitrite ions resulting from complete
   inhibition of nitrite oxidation occurred at an ammonium loading rate of
   10 kg-N.m(-3)-carrier.d(-1). By measuring oxygen effectiveness factor of

Abstract = {{The dissolved organic load of tannery wastewater and of the effluents of
   an anaerobic and aerobic treatment were investigated over a 2 yr period.
   The average dissolved organic carbon content (DOG) of raw wastewater is
   900 mg l(-1), corresponding to a discharge of 23 kg DOC t(-1) raw hide.
   The two step biological treatment removes an average 85\% of the DOC and
   50\% of the UV254-absorbance. The high initial toxicity of tannery
   wastewater, as determined in the luminescence inhibition test (EC50: 5
   ml l(-1)) is diminished by two orders of magnitude. GC-MS screening
   analyses of fractionated wastewater extracts determined about 200
   individual components in the various wastewater qualities. Identified
   substances were grouped into 12 substance classes, among them aliphatic
   and aromatic carboxylic acids, alcohols, phenols, indoles, cyclohexanes
   and ethoxylates, and their contents were quantitatively assessed.
   Anaerobic and aerobic treatment exhibit significantly different impacts
   onto the dissolved organic matter: reproduction of raw wastewater
   constituents and formation/release of new components are important
   processes under anaerobic conditions; aromatic compounds are poorly
   removed. Aerobic processes aim at mineralization and are, thus,
   effective against all substance classes. Despite the substantial
   improvement of the tannery wastewater quality by the two step biological
   treatment, some luminescence inhibition remained (EC50: 400 ml l(-1))
   and persistent substances of environmental concern were identified in
   the fully treated effluents. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Since the early days of the use of the excess biological phosphorus
   removal (EBPR) process, it has been discussed whether and 60 what
   extent, chemical precipitation contributes to the phosphorus removal
   that is seen in the process. In this study, calcium phosphate
   precipitation in EBPR systems was investigated. Four laboratory-scale
   fill and draw activated sludge systems operating in parallel, fed with
   natural Ca-rich wastewater, with additions of acetate and phosphate were
   studied. Two of the systems were operated as EBPR systems and the
   remaining two as aerobic systems. The results showed that calcium
   phosphate precipitation occurred in all the systems at sufficiently high
   concentrations of calcium and phosphate. Based on differences in the
   effluent water, the Ca/P molar ratio of the precipitate was found to be
   around 1-1.3. Redissolution occurred when the concentrations of calcium
   and phosphate had fallen below the saturation curve for Ca-3(PO4)(2) at
   neutral pH, and below the saturation curve for CaHPO4 at pH approximate
   to 8.5. The results also showed that the concentration of phosphate in
   the effluent from the EBPR system could be substantially lower than from
   the aerobic system, for the same effluent concentration of calcium. This
   indicates that there is an important time factor involved, which implies
   that simple equilibrium equations cannot be used alone to judge whether
   or to what extent, precipitation will take place. The results suggest
   that at neutral pH the phosphate concentration must be at least 50 mg P
   l(-1) at a calcium concentration of 100 mg Ca l(-1), and in soft water
   much higher, before precipitation starts. This, together with the fact
   that redissolution starts at phosphate concentrations far above 1 mg P
   l(-1) indicates that in most cases calcium phosphate precipitation in
   EBPR processes with municipal wastewater does not constitute a
   significant phosphorus removal mechanism. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Sewage sludge contains significant plant nutrients and has long been
   recycled to farmland. Composting of the sludge can reduce the potential
   risks of pathogen contamination, ground water pollution and odours when
   applied an to land, Sewage sludge usually also contains significant
   heavy metals and high moisture content that may limit its land
   application, Composting of sewage sludge with bauxite refining residue
   (red mud) may overcome these problems. A laboratory experiment of
   composting digested sewage sludge amended with red mud was therefore
   carried out to investigate bow red mud affected the composting process.
   The temperature, pH, moisture content and volatile solids were monitored
   during composting. A mass balance was conducted by also measuring the
   carbon dioxide, oxygen, ammonia and condensate in the exit air: and
   total organic carbon and nitrogen in the compost. The results show that
   the amendment with red mud improved the composting process by raising
   the temperature, removing moisture, and increasing the decomposition
   rate. The red mud adsorbed the CO2 released From the sludge during
   decomposition, increasing the DH buffering capacity of the compost. The
   alkalinity of red mud and low C-to-N ratio in digested sludge increased
   ammonia volatilisation during sludge composting, Addition of external
   organic carbon effectively increased the C-to-N ratio and decreased the
   ammonia volatilisation. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption of four ultrafiltration fractions of natural organic
   material (NOM) had a significant effect on the surface area and pore
   volume distributions of a coal-based activated carbon. This effect was
   dependent on the size of the compounds; the smaller fraction had the
   greatest effect on the micropore volume, and the larger fractions had a
   greater effect on the mesopore volume. Only the mesopore volume of a
   wood-based activated carbon was reduced by adsorption of the NOM
   fractions. The competitive adsorption between five NOM ultrafiltration
   fractions and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) was greatest for the smallest
   fraction (ultrafiltration molecular weight <500), as this fraction was
   the most similar in size to MIB and therefore provided direct
   competition for the same adsorption sites. The NOM in a natural water
   sample displayed the greatest competition with MIB, due to the presence
   of small compounds that were lost during the concentration and desalting
   procedures used to obtain the NOM fractions. The competition between MIB
   and the largest ultrafiltration fraction was very small and could
   probably be attributed to smaller compounds present in this fraction.

Abstract = {{Reliable design and operation of biological wastewater treatment systems
   demands robust modelling of the degradation processes. However, methods
   to directly measure key bacterial growth parameters have not been
   available to the wastewater industry. Here, we directly measure
   bacterial specific growth rates without changing the treatment
   environment. Bacterial growth (with the thymidine assay) and biomass (by
   direct counts) measurements were used to compare the dynamics of the
   microbial community in the different compartments of an activated sludge
   process. The aerobic compartment specific growth rate mu was 0.5 d(-1).
   In this work, we explain the concept of the thymidine growth assay the
   traps for the novice and how to apply the method to biological nutrient
   removal processes. These methods now allow us to distinguish bacterial
   growth from metabolic activity and observe how the cell allocates its
   resources between the two. This represents the first application of a
   very powerful tool to directly measure population dynamics and kinetics
   of bacteria in wastewater treatment processes. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{In this paper a methodology comprising a non-linear least-squares

   study it is found that incorporation of a multiplication factor for the
   sum of the square of errors associated with effluent quality could lead
   to a more balanced estimation of parameters, while achieving a better
   fit for both effluent quality and headless. In the case study it is
   found that the shape of the fitted effluent quality curve has
   significant impact on the values of the model parameters. The proposed
   algorithm appears to be well suited for obtaining the best fit for both
   effluent quality and headless, simultaneously. The value of the
   multiplication factor should be fixed based on the accuracy required
   under both effluent quality and headless predictions. The model
   parameters predicted under each of the case studies, correlated well

   non-conservative water-quality constituents and sediment transport
   fluxes in estuarine and coastal waters. The model involves using the
   finite difference technique to solve the equations of mass and momentum
   conservation and the transport equations for a range of water quality
   indicators and sediment transport forms. The momentum equations include
   the effects of the Earth's rotation, refined bed and surface shear
   stresses and a zero or two-equation turbulence model. The model outlined
   has been applied to a number of site-specific estuaries for modelling
   flow, water-quality and sediment transport processes, with details
   reported herein of the model application to the Humber Estuary, in the
   U.K. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-nine species of ciliate protozoa were recorded in samples of
   activated sludge collected monthly from tanks at Davyhulme Sewage Works,
   Manchester, U.K., over a two-year period (1991-1992). The most Frequent
   species present included Aspidisca cicada, Chilodonella uncinata,
   Vorticella convallaria and Vorticella microstoma. The total ciliate
   population showed clear seasonal variation, with highest counts between
   February and August. Only two species showed significant correlation
   with ambient temperature. Species diversity had little variation, with
   8-13 ciliate species being identified in most samples. Significant
   positive interspecies correlations were noted for ten species, but were
   not consistent for both years.
   Mean concentrations of the metals Fe, Ni, Zn, Cu and Cr in the liquid
   phase of activated sludge varied considerably over the two annual
   sampling periods, with no seasonal pattern. Major ciliates present were
   able to tolerate high concentrations of contaminant metals, including Fe
   (> 2000 ppb), Zn (> 500 ppb), Cu (> 60 ppb) and Cr (100 ppb). Specific
   positive and negative ciliate species-metal correlations were observed
   in each annual sampling period. but were not consistent for both years.
   The lack of consistent correlations over the two-year sampling period
   between populations of individual protozoan species and single
   biological (other species) or physicochemical (temperature, metal
   concentrations) factors is in accordance with a complex (multifactorial)
   determination of protozoan populations in activated sludge. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Resistance to 20 antimicrobials was tested in 79 Salmonella strains
   isolated from river and lake waters in northern Greece. Of the strains,
   19 (24.1\%) exhibited resistance to one or more of the antibiotics while
   single, double and multiple resistances were oberved in 12.7, 6.3 and
   5.1\% of the isolates, respectively. Streptomycin resistance was the
   most common and nine different antibiotic resistance patterns were
   recorded in total. All of the strains were susceptible to
   amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, colistin, amikacin
   and apramycin. Among the resistant salmonellas, five (26.3\%) were able
   to transfer R factors to the Escherichia coli recipient. Resistance to
   ampicillin and ticarcillin was transferable in four cases, resistance to
   chloramphenicol, trimethoprim and sulfafurazole in two cases, whereas
   resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, spectinomycin, kanamycin and
   tetracycline was transferable in one case. Chloramphenicol resistance,
   in one of the two cases, was transferable only after mobilization with
   the X+ Factor while streptomycin resistance, although prevailing, was
   not found to be transferable even after mobilization. The geometric
   means of the fecal indicator bacteria, i.e. total coliforms, fecal
   coliforms and fecal streptococci did not significantly differ between
   samples with antibiotic sensitive and resistant Salmonella isolates. (C)

Abstract = {{Oxidation kinetics and mechanisms of four trihalomethanes (THMs)
   commonly found in chlorinated drinking water by Fenton's reagent were
   investigated. All the experiments were carried out in air-tight and
   well-mixed batch reactors in which no headspace was allowed in order to
   minimize volatilization of any THM during reaction. The optimum dosages
   of H2O2 and Fe2+ in the oxidation of bromoform was 3.7-1.9 mM for all
   the initial concentrations at pH 3.5. The maximum bromoform degradations
   of 85, 78 and 65\% at 3 min were achieved for bromoform concentrations
   of 295, 98.3 and 49.2 mu g/l, respectively. The pseudo-first-order
   oxidation constants of THMs increase with the increasing number of
   bromine atoms present in a THM molecule, with bromoform being oxidized
   the fastest and bromodichloromethane being oxidized the slowest. No
   oxidative degradation of chloroform was oberved, because the losses in
   chloroform concentration during the oxidation experiments are the same
   as what was observed in control experiments. Experiments conducted on
   the THM mixtures gave similar results in terms of extent of observed
   oxidative degradation, the amount of THM oxidized increased with
   increasing initial organic concentrations. The oxidation rate constants
   for each THM in the mixture also increased as the number of bromine
   atoms present in a THM molecule increased, with bromoform exhibiting the
   Fastest kinetic rates and bromodichloromethane exhibiting the slowest
   kinetic rates. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A new method, using low magnification microscopy combined with image
   analysis to estimate settling properties of activated sludge, is
   presented. It is shown that the morphology of the activated sludge flocs
   correlates significantly with the settling properties of the sludge, as
   expressed by traditional settling tests. The morphology is expressed by
   two parameters: the mean equivalent circle diameter and the mean form
   factor of the sludge flocs. In contrast with traditional tests, the new
   method takes only between 10 and 20 min. is automated and call be
   incorporated in other sensors. In addition. a rapid and reliable
   estimate of the suspended solids concentration can be obtained by
   establishing a calibration between the mean field area of a series of
   images with the concentration of a certain type of activated sludge. The
   relevance of the novel method is clearly illustrated by its ability to
   monitor the rise and the subsequent cure of a severe case of bulking in
   an activated sludge pilot plant. It is shown that a more sensitive
   measurement of the sludge settleability is obtained by using image
   analysis. Consequently, the method presented may have good potential in
   being used as an early warning system. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic model which describes nitritification and nitratification in
   trickling filters has been developed. The model predicts the
   concentration profiles of ammonia, nitrite and nitrate along the filter
   depth and along the biofilm depth, as a function of the operating
   parameters, in batch as well as in continuous operation. The model can
   also predict the biofilm thickness as a function of filter depth and
   time. The batch version of the model predicts that the best moment to
   start the continuous operation is the moment when Nitrobacter
   concentration is maximum and nitrite concentration is minimum, while the
   continuous version of the model predicts that nitrite accumulation would
   be observed only when a significant ammonia concentration is observed at
   the filter outlet. A pilot-scale trickling filter was used in order to
   verify the predicted results. In all cases there was very good agreement
   between predicted and experimental results. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{An experimental design For a nonlinear sludge blanket interface settling
   model was examined. The model describes sludge settling in a batch
   reactor as a function of time having two parameters. The criterion
   applied in detecting the minimal sampling schedule was the D-optimality.
   The design was constructed on the basis of the Wynn-Fedrov algorithm.
   The algorithm proved its validity leading to a logical result. The
   optimal sampling design consists of two measurement points which is
   equal to the number of parameters to be estimated. This is a generally
   observed result in D-optimality and can be interpreted that in the
   D-optimality the information per implemented observation is maximized.
   In addition to the determination of optimal sampling schedule, the
   experimental design can be used in examining models. The two measurement
   paints have the same weights indicating that the parameters are equally
   important in the examined model. The results also show that a small
   change in the nominal values of the parameters have a minor effect on
   the output of the studied model. The model output is more sensitive to
   the changes in the parameter alpha than to the changes in the parameter
   C. In the field of environmental engineering, model oriented
   observational design is rarely utilized, although it might be helpful in
   achieving better understanding of models and more effective utilization
   of resources. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Four granular activated carbons manufactured from different raw
   materials were evaluated for the removal of 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) to
   below odor threshold concentration using equilibrium isotherm tests. MIB
   adsorption isotherms were compared in the aqueous equilibrium
   concentration range < 10-100 ng/l. The data showed that the bituminous
   carbon has the highest adsorption capacity, followed by the peat,
   lignite, and wood carbons. This is the first time GAC isotherm data are
   available at such low level; such data are needed to aid selection of
   the appropriate carbon product to remove this musty taste-and-odor
   (T\&O) causing compound. The precision of the analytical method used in
   this study was evaluated by analyzing a spiked solution at 2 ng/l MIB,
   and was found to be 2 +/- 1 ng/l. The absence of background competition
   in these organic pure water isotherms was verified. in natural water,
   however, competition from both nanogram- to microgram-per-liter of
   dissolved low molecular weight hydrophobic organic compounds (<400
   daltons) and milligram-per-liter of natural organic matter (>400
   daltons) contributed to changes in isotherms and to the reduction of MIB
   adsorption capacity. A database of organic pure water isotherms with MIB
   would be of important value to water facilities requiring T\&O control
   as it provides a reliable starting point for GAC product selection.
   However, field or pilot tests are still needed for the final selection
   owing to the varying characteristics of individual water source. (C)

Abstract = {{Nitrite accumulation is frequently observed in leachate treatment
   plants. Generally, it has been attributed to unfavourable process
   conditions during the nitrification process. Production and utilization
   of nitrite during leachate treatment were investigated in an activated
   sludge bioreactor and an aerobic packed bed/anoxic activated sludge
   reactor. Under the conditions used, nitrite was accumulated bq
   incomplete nitrification during the start-up period of the treatment
   only. On the other hand, high amounts of nitrite were built-up within
   the denitrification step. These high nitrite concentrations (more than
   200 mg l(-1) NO2-) were measured during the start-up period of the
   denitrification process and al TOC/N-ratios less than 1.5. Nitrite
   accumulation and nitrite utilization could be correlated with changes in
   the microbial community present. During the start-up period (about 20
   days), most of the bacteria isolated from the denitrification tank were
   able to reduce both nitrate and nitrite. Later at a TOC/N-ratio of 3.5,
   a significant shift in the activated sludge biocommunity was observed.
   After 40 days, less than 0.1\% of the isolated bacteria were capable to
   reduce nitrite. From the results obtained, it is concluded that the
   composition of the biocommunity plays a more important role in
   denitrification of leachate than previously considered. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The biosorption of the three metallic ions, lead, cadmium and zinc, in

   comparison is made between the one metal sorption system and the
   influence of a second metal on the uptake of the primary one. The
   competitive effect on the uptake of various heavy metals on the
   Alteromonas macleodii subsp fijiensis has been studied using the
   Langmuir model for bisolute systems; The isotherms indicate a
   competition for the same binding site with zinc and cadmium. Lead is
   preferentially complexed by EPS in the bi-component solutions. The
   hydrothermal bacterial exopolysaccharide is shown to possess an affinity
   for the tested metal ions which makes its use as a biosorbent a possible

Abstract = {{The influence of pH over nitrification in submerged biofilters has been
   studied through the observation of three pH effects over the nitrifying
   biofilm: activation-deactivation, substrate limitation, and free ammonia
   inhibition. Within a pH range of 5.0-9.0, a pH increase of one unit
   produce a 13\% increase on the nitrification efficiency. A stoichiometry
   of 7.1 mg CaCO3/mg N was measured for the process, which became
   alkalinity limited below pH 5.0. The highest activity of ammonium
   oxidizers and the highest values of volatile attached solids (VAS) in
   the filter were obtained at pH 8.2. The concentration of volatile
   attached solids (VAS) was regulated by free ammonia inhibition,
   substrate limitation (NH4+ concentration), and reactor hydrodynamics.
   Inhibition by free ammonia controlled bacteria activity at pH greater
   than 7.5, observing an increase of microorganisms concentration in the
   filter as a specific free ammonia concentration (mg NH3free-N gVAS(-1))
   decreased. A nitrite accumulation of up to 80-90\% was obtained for
   specific inhibitory concentrations greater than 1.5 mg NH3free-N
   gVAS(-1) resulting from the selective inhibition of nitrite oxidizers.

Abstract = {{Many synthetic dyes in industrial wastewaters are resistant to
   degradation in conventional biological treatment process. Decolorization
   of eight synthetic dyes including ate, anthraquinone, metal complex and
   indigo were examined in white-rot fungal cultures and by fungal
   peroxidase-catalysed oxidation. The dyes were not decolorized by
   manganese-dependent peroxidase (MnP) while above 80\% color was removed
   by ligninase-catalysed oxidation. Dye decolorization rate increased
   linearly with ligninase doses. Compared with fungal cultures in which
   ligninase was detected, partially purified ligninase showed a consistent
   and higher extent of dye decolorization with other essential components
   being provided such as veratryl alcohol, hydrogen peroxide and acidic pH
   (3.5-5). Veratryl alcohol had a critical concentration level above which
   no further effect on dye decolorization was observed. Depending on the
   influence of H2O2 on dye decolorization, the eight dyes can be divided
   into two groups; one had an optimum H2O2 concentration and the other
   showed increased decolorization with high H2O2 doses. Dye concentration
   had a negative effect on decolorization rate in general. The dye
   concentration above which the negative effect was observed varied from
   10 to 125 mg/L, depending on individual dye structure. These results
   indicate that a highly efficient bioprocess using white-rot fungi to
   remove color from industrial effluents should produce ligninase, H2O2,
   veratryl alcohol continuously and coordinately under acidic condition
   and controlled back-mixing flow of wastewater. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Past trends in the biology and chemistry of the Herrenwieser See in the
   base-poor Bunter Sandstone Black Forest were reconstructed from a
   sediment core. Diatom inferred pH indicated pre-industrial acidification
   periods with subsequent recovery. For the most recent acidification,
   multiple regression indicated a pH decline by 0.78 pH units to a minimum
   of pn 3.91 in the early 1980s; weighted averaging also indicated a pH
   minimum in the 1980s, but the lowest value was pH 4.58 and the overall
   decline only 0.30 units. The most important indicator species were
   Asterionella ralfsii for moderate acidification and Tabellaria
   quadriseptata for extreme acidification. Community diversity H' and
   floristic composition, as shown by cluster analysis, were sensitive to
   pH changes in the lake. Chlorophyll pigments offered another indicator
   for pH trends since periods of acidification were accompanied by higher
   concentrations of chlorophyll derivatives. Acidic inputs into the lake
   were indirectly detected via analysis of persistent pollutants, metals
   and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Characteristic chemical changes
   indicated a metal burden from atmospheric deposition, and the release of
   base cations and aluminium from weathering, PAH concentrations rose
   simultaneously with the pH decline in the 19th century. After the input
   maximum in the 1960s the Aux rates for PAHs decreased and are now <20\%
   of their peak value. The simultaneous trends in biological indicators
   and persistent pollutants demonstrate that recent acidification was
   caused by atmospheric acid deposition. So far there has been no
   significant reverse trend despite signs of recent changes indicated by
   the diatoms. However, pre-industrial acidification and recovery were
   also related to acid deposition, and indicate that reversal is possible
   in this lake. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the determination of the adsorption capacities of
   various organic compounds in water suspension on MnO2 pyrolusite which
   can be present in the natural environment and in potabilisation
   treatment. The adsorption was linearised according to Langmuir and
   Freundlich models. Humic acids were adsorbed on MnO2 under the working
   conditions used in this study. Tannic acid was also removed by MnO2 but
   at a lesser level and the model appeared to be more complex, thus
   suggesting tannic acid precipitation at the surface of MnO2. More
   generally, it was observed after studying the adsorption capacity of
   various molecules, that negatively charged molecules were poorly
   adsorbed on MnO, probably because of electrostatic interactions whereas
   cationic molecules were easily adsorbed. Hydrophobic interactions seemed
   to be a second factor making adsorption on MnO2 much easier.
   Electrokinetic potential measurement of suspended particles of MnO2 was
   in good correlation with these hypotheses. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Currently drinking water from the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland
   is treated by the traditional process of coagulation and filtration.
   Semiconductor photocatalysis was investigated as an alternative. Aldrich
   humic acid solutions (100 mg dm(-3), filtered through 0.22 mu m
   Millipore filters) were photolysed in a 0.1\% suspension of Degussa P25
   titanium dioxide using a mercury lamp. Degradation of humic acid was
   followed over time by measuring colour in Hazen units, 254/400 nm
   absorbance, fluorescence (excitation 237 nm; emission 400 nm) and size
   exclusion high performance chromatography. The extent of complete
   oxidation was determined by measuring dissolved organic carbon, chemical
   oxygen demand and carbon dioxide released. It took approximately 12 min
   to reduce the humic acid concentration by half; however 50\% complete
   mineralization took 60 min. Some of the intermediates of reaction were
   highly fluorescent. In the absence of oxygen, light or titanium dioxide
   no significant degradation occurred. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{High rate anaerobic wastewater treatment systems usually give rise to
   biomass structured in different types of aggregates, depending on
   prevalent environmental conditions. Although highly dependent on
   wastewater characteristics, granules are generally formed and found in
   UASB reactors, whereas flocs are mainly found in fixed bed reactors.
   Different structures usually have different shapes and surface
   roughness. The aim of this work is to provide a contribution to the
   differentiation of those kinds of aggregates. A numerical parameter, the
   fractal dimension, was used to quantify the surface roughness. The
   fractal dimension, of two families of particles, was measured by two
   methods: (i) a box counting method; (ii) a method based on an area-size
   relationship. In both cases, the differences were highly statistically
   significant. Using the box counting method, for each of the 54 particles
   of each family, the average fractal dimension was 1.90 +/- 9.02 for
   flocs and 1.95 +/- 0.01 for granules (+/- 99\% confidence interval). The
   log-log plot of area vs longest size was linear and the calculated
   fractal dimensions from this plot were 1.84 +/- 0.13 and 2.14 +/- 0.08
   (+/- 99\% confidence interval) for flocs and granules, respectively.
   Fractal dimension was proven to be a suitable parameter to quantify and
   differentiate surface roughness of different microbial aggregates
   present in high rate anaerobic digesters. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   phosphatase activity (APA) was studied in a shallow Chinese freshwater
   lake (Donghu Lake). At the three experimental stations the values of
   V-max of APA were higher and the negative correlation between

   stronger during summer (from June to September) P depletion. At the same
   time, the values of Michaelis constant (K-m) of APA at the three

   phosphorus deficiency not only by an increase in enzyme production but
   also by an improved ability to use low substrate concentrations. (C)

Abstract = {{The hydraulic performance of a deep wastewater stabilization pond
   located in the Espinardo Campus of the University of Murcia was studied.
   The pond has a maximum capacity of 15,000 m(3), with a maximum depth of
   8 m.
   Sulforhodamine B dye is used as a tracer in the experimental study,
   which was carried out in two different climatic periods, winter and
   summer, so that the influence of temperature on the internal
   hydrodynamic of the lagoon could be ascertained. Two types of sample
   were obtained. One was taken from the mass of water within the pond and
   the other at the outlet.
   The mean real residence time ((t) over bar) was calculated and it was
   below the spatial time (tau) both in summer and winter. Sampling carried
   out in the outlet flow along the time allowed the application of
   population balance models and to analyze the existence of short circuits
   and dead spaces. The pond active volume was calculated, being 70 and
   22\% of total volume in winter and summer, respectively. In both
   seasons, the active zone showed a hydrodynamic behaviour similar to the
   completely mixed continuous tank reactor (observed in the curves C and
   in the fitting of the experimental data at outlet and the use of the
   combined model of Cholette and Cloutier).
   From the experimental data of the remaining BOD5 it was possible to
   calculate the global kinetic constants for organic matter degradation
   and, from this, the constants at 20 degrees C obtained at the most
   unfavourable (higher) water temperature observed. Both in winter and
   summer constants values (K-20 = 0.46 and 0.32 d(-1)) seemed to point to
   the active zone of the system, showing a fundamentally aerobic
   behaviour. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminium salts are commonly used as reactants for
   coagulation-flocculation in the treatment of drinking water supplies.
   Powdered activated carbon (PAC) is also sometimes used to decrease
   accidental or chronic organic pollution. If organic matter has to be
   removed, powdered activated carbon and aluminium salts can be used
   simultaneously. The aluminium salts and natural organic matter such as
   fulvic acids will be competitive adsorbates on PAC. There could,
   furthermore, be complexation of organic matter and Al3+ ions.
   For this present study, phenol, pyrocatechol, phthalic, benzoic,
   salicyclic and tannic acids are generally considered to be simple models
   of humic matter. The complexation of these molecules with aluminium ions
   was investigated and, if possible, the stoichiometry of the complexes
   and the values of the apparent complex formation constant were
   determined.
   All the solutions were prepared with distilled water and filtered
   through a 0.2 mu m cellulose filter. The pH was adjusted to 4.6 with HCl
   or NaOH solutions. Measurements were performed by UV spectrophotometry
   methods, using a Schimadzu UV 160 A apparatus. The spectra of phenol
   (269 nm) and pyrocatechol (275 nm) were the same with or without Al3+
   ions indicating that they probably did not complex (at pH 4.6) with Al3+
   ions. At pH 4.6 there was a shift of the maximum adsorption of the
   spectrum (specific peak) for salicylic and benzoic acids (297 and 227
   nm, respectively), but it was small enough to allow measurements. This
   shift revealed complexation of the acids and Al3+ ions, even though the
   ionization of these molecules depends on their pKa. (C) 1997 Elsevier

   performed in two phases: (i) experiments without heavy metals (HMs),
   (ii) experiments with HMs using acclimated microorganisms (MOs). In the
   first phase, biokinetic constants of the synthetic WW inoculated with
   seed MOs were determined and a linear relationship between substrate
   removal efficiency and mean cell residence time was found. In the second
   phase, experiments were conducted with acclimated MOs for processing a
   WW containing 1.5 mg Cu2+/L and 9 mg Zn2+/L. A variable relationship
   between substrate removal efficiency and mean cell residence time was
   obtained. The net result of the presence of Cu2+ and Zn2+ in a synthetic
   WW was found to be toxic to the MOs in ASP. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The removal performance of phenol in a four-stage cross-flow
   laboratory-scale rotating biological contactor (RBC) reactor was
   investigated in the present study. The impacts of major process and
   operating variables, viz. input phenol concentration (PH,), input phenol
   loading (PH.L), input hydraulic loading (HL), temperature of wastewater
   (T), and rotational speed of discs (omega) on the removal efficiency of
   the system were examined. A first-order reaction with an average rate
   constant (K-c) value of 0.10-0.13 h(-1) at a temperature range of
   20.5-27.0 degrees C was obtained for the biodegradation of phenolic
   wastewater. On the basis of overall treatment of phenolic wastewater in
   the RBC reactor, the optimal removal performance was noted at the end of
   the second stage inclusive of the first one. It was observed that the
   phenol removal performance improved at higher input phenol
   concentrations, while at the increased level of input hydraulic loading,
   the removal performance worsened. The effect of temperature in improving
   the removal efficiency was significant in the temperature range of 13-36
   degrees C. The temperature activity coefficient (theta) value of the
   VantHoff-Arrhenius equation was computed as 1.04 in the stated range of
   temperature. The positive role of rotational speed of discs in the
   treatment of phenolic wastewater was more pronounced in the range of
   3.7-10 rpm. The major group of microbes, responsible for the microbial
   treatment of phenol in the acclimatized concentration up to 420 g m(-3),
   was identified as Pseudomonas and the corresponding species were
   detected as stutzeri and Putida. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Blanket height is an important aspect of UASB reactor design. It
   regulates the solid concentration reaching the gas-solid separator (GSS)
   and, thereby, prevents sludge washout. The maximum organic load which a
   reactor can assimilate depends on proper proportioning of the reactor
   height into the bed and blanket. A condition of force equilibrium has
   been considered between the rising gas bubbles and the adjacent water
   mass. The negative pressure behind the bubble attracts the water mass
   and leads to the formation of a wake. Using diffusion concepts, solid
   particles moving along the wake due to concentration gradient have been
   equated to those settling down under the influence of gravity at steady
   state and solid concentration along the blanket height is ascertained.
   Computed values have been found to compare well with the scanty
   experimental observations available from the literature. Using this
   model, it is possible to size the reactor. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Cr(VI) reduction data obtained with three bacterial species (Escherichia
   coli ATCC 33456, Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens LB 300) were
   analyzed using an enzyme-based kinetic model. The model was developed by
   incorporating enzyme kinetics and a finite Cr(VI) reduction capacity to
   illustrate toxic effects of Cr(VI). The model was also used to analyze
   Cr(VI) reduction data taken from the literature for two other
   C-(VI)-reducing species (Desulfovibrio vulgaris ATCC 29579, and
   Pseudomonas ambigua G-1). Although our different genera of bacteria were
   involved, the model was found to be capable of describing Cr(VI)
   reduction. The finite capacity indicates the maximum amount of Cr(VI)
   that a batch culture can reduce and it was explicitly demonstrated
   regardless of subsequent cell growth. The lost of Cr(VI) reduction
   capacity in bacterial cells may be attributed to the mutagenic and toxic
   effects of Cr(VI). The batch cultures reduced Cr(VI) at rates which
   decreased progressively with the amount of Cr(VI) reduced. Cr(VI)
   reduction ceased whenever the maximum capacity was reached. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Changes in bacterial colonisation on initially clean sand grains in an
   anaerobic fluidised bed reactor (FBR) were studied by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM). The FBR was part of a laboratory-scale treatment
   system for nitrate removal from fish culture water. Denitrifying
   bacteria in the FBR were supplied with anaerobically digested fish feed
   as carbon and energy source and with nitrate as electron acceptor.
   Bacterial biofilm formation started rapidly with single rods settling in
   the fissures and cavities on the sand grain's surface. Rods
   (Pseudomonas-like and Zoogloea-like) divided and accumulated and after
   about 10 days were integrated in a biofilm which almost covered the
   entire grains. Apart from single rods, colonies of bacteria resembling
   Zoogloea developed from the second day onwards. After approximately 10
   days, the zoogloeal colonies were overgrown by bacteria resembling
   Pseudomonas. A steady increase in these cells was observed, eventually
   leading to a situation in which the majority of grains were totally
   covered with a compact biofilm comprised of these bacteria. The biofilm
   increased in thickness with time and around day 20, sloughing was
   observed at parts of the biofilm surface. These sloughed areas were
   colonised once more with bacteria according to a similar succession
   pattern observed on the initially clean sand grains. The colonisation
   pattern on sand in the laboratory-scale FBR was compared to the
   colonisation on sand grains in an FBR, operating in a pilot-plant of a
   closed intensive fish culture system. The bacterial biofilm structure
   was similar in both reactors. In the pilot-plant FBR all different
   stages of colonisation, observed in the laboratory-scale FBR, occurred
   simultaneously. Also in the pilot-plant FBR, bacteria resembling
   Zoogloea and Pseudomonas were most abundant. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Results of biological sampling of granular activated carbon (GAC)
   filtrate taken between May 1994 and August 1995 at three different
   treatment plants along the river Rhine indicate that GAC filters are
   colonized by invertebrates. Dominating organism groups were rotifers and
   nematodes. Depending on operational characteristics, mainly regeneration
   intervals and backwashing procedures, the filter colonization can lead
   to an output of organisms in high numbers with the filtrate. Examples
   are given for the development of filter colonization and for the
   influence of different backwashing procedures to reduce numbers of
   invertebrates in GAC filters. These findings underline the establishment
   of a complex food web in a GAC filter, the consequences of which still
   remain to be investigated in detail. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The polyanionic fraction of digested sludge extracellular material was
   quantified using an in situ dye adsorption method, and the relationships
   between measured extracellular polyanion (ECPA) concentrations and
   sludge dewaterability were investigated. Measured ECPA concentrations
   were 18-30\% of the sludge total solids (32-46\% of the volatile
   solids), when expressed as equivalents of sodium alginate. These values
   may be an overestimate of the true value, but are likely a more accurate
   estimate than those derived from extraction-based methodologies. The
   relationship between total ECPA concentration and digested sludge
   dewaterability was dependent on digester feed composition, suggesting
   that specific ECPA biochemical characteristics are more significant than
   total concentration as an influence on dewaterability. The influence of
   the soluble/colloidal fraction of the total ECPA on digested sludge
   dewaterability was consistently adverse, but from a full-scale
   dewatering perspective was insignificant. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The seed husks of the multipurpose tree Moringa oleifera are potentially
   a waste product that may be available in large quantities, and previous
   work has demonstrated that a microporous activated carbon can be
   produced from them by carbonisation under nitrogen followed by
   activation in steam. This research examines the efficacy of a simpler
   and cheaper activation process, single-step steam pyrolysis activation,
   with a view to promoting the production of low-cost activated carbon in
   the developing world.
   Husks were heated in a steam atmosphere to 750 degrees C for 30 or 120
   min, or 800 degrees C for 30 min, then the resulting carbons were tested
   to determine their iodine numbers and adsorption isotherms for phenol,
   4-nitrophenol and methylene blue. Phenol and 4-nitrophenol were adsorbed
   rapidly by all three carbons, with 80-90\% w/w adsorbed in the first 30
   min, whereas methylene blue adsorption was slower. Pyrolysis at 800
   degrees C for 30 min produced a carbon (yield 12.2\% w/w) with an iodine
   number of 703 mg g(-1), a phenol specific surface area (SSA) of 629 m(2)
   g(-1), a 4-nitrophenol SSA of 664 m(2) g(-1) and a methylene blue SSA of
   211 m(2) g(-1). The carbon produced at 750 degrees C for 120 min (yield
   11.9\% w/w) had similar properties, but the one produced at 750 degrees
   C for 30 min (yield 16.6\% w/w) had a less developed porosity. The
   adsorbance characteristics of the two best carbons were superior to
   those produced previously by the conventional two-stage
   carbonisation-activation, and were competitive with commercial carbons.
   These results demonstrate that steam pyrolysis activation of M. oleifera
   husks could provide a low-cost, local source of high quality activated
   carbon in the developing world. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to determine the characteristics of the Iskar
   upper watershed surface waters as a first step of a seasonal evolution
   study. The geochemical and petrochemical characteristics of the Rila
   massif are well-suited to study the relative significance of different
   weathering mechanisms occurring along the year in a mountain aquatic
   system. In such an area the atmospheric input contribution to the
   surface water quality could be assessed. A first sampling survey in
   summer-time allowed us to get some data on major and minor elements in
   the soluble phase. The results show that the Iskar upper watershed is
   well-suited because of no mixing with long residence time groundwaters
   and of the low population density which results in insignificant
   anthropic input. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of denitrifying phosphorus removing bacteria (DPB) and
   the contribution of DPB to phosphorus removal in full-scale wastewater
   treatment plants (WWTPs) has been investigated by batch tests with the
   activated sludge from two WWTPs (WWTP-Genemuiden and -Holten). Both
   WWTPs are operated as UCT-type processes. Batch tests to evaluate the
   biomass composition of the sludges were developed. These batch tests
   showed a clear difference of denitrifying dephosphatation activity
   between the WWTP-Genemuiden and -Holten sludge. In the sludge of the
   WWTP-Genemuiden the (denitrifying) dephosphatation activity was rather
   low, whereas a high activity was formed in the WWTP-Holten sludge. The
   following possible reasons for the lower proportion of (denitrifying)
   dephosphatation activity in the WWTP-Genemuiden sludge in comparison
   with the WWTP-Holten sludge, were suggested; (a) nitrate/oxygen transfer
   to the anaerobic/anoxic zone due to the internal recirculation inside
   the treatment plant, (b) lower amounts of fatty acids in the influent
   due to shorter retention time of waste water in sewer lines, and (c)
   lower amount of nitrate recycled to the anoxic zone. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The UV-visible photolysis of ferrioxalate in the presence of hydrogen
   peroxide (the UV-vis/ferrioxalate/H2O2 process) is investigated for the
   treatment of contaminated groundwater and industrial wastewater. This
   process generates the hydroxyl radical, which is a strong oxidant and
   reacts rapidly with most organic compounds present in solution. Tap
   water spiked with various organic pollutants, a process water containing
   chlorobenzene, a tank-bottom water containing a mixture of benzene,
   toluene and xylenes (BTX), a wastewater containing 1,4-dioxane and
   another wastewater containing methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid
   were treated with the UV-vis/ferrioxalate/H2O2 process and the
   efficiency compared with alternative oxidation processes, including the
   UV/H2O2 and UV-vis/Fe(II)/H2O2 (UV-Fenton) processes. The destruction of
   specific compounds and group parameters, such as TOC and BOD, were used
   to examine the relative energy efficiencies of the alternative
   processes. The data indicate that in nearly all cases, the new
   UV-vis/ferrioxalate/H2O2 process has a much higher efficiency (by a
   factor of about 3 to 30) than does either the UV-vis/Fe(II)/H2O2 process
   or the UV/H2O2 process. It is concluded that this new process is very
   efficient and useful for the treatment of moderate to highly
   contaminated waters. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   tests for the counts of coliforms, faecal coliforms, enterococci, S.
   aureus, yeasts and moulds were carried out. Water and sand samples were
   very low in indicator organisms of faecal pollution. Human species of
   yeasts were are present in water and sand samples of both sites. S.
   aureus was isolated From water and sand samples twice in winter. In
   summer, S. aureus was recovered more often from sand than from water
   samples in both sites. Water and sand samples in both sites contained
   significantly more S. aureus in summer than in winter samples. In
   summer, more yeasts of human origin were present in sand samples while
   less in water samples. A significant correlation appears between the
   number of swimmers present on the beach and S. aureus counts in water
   samples; the correlation is stronger al the more popular beach. In sand
   samples S. aureus counts correlate with the number of swimmers present

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{A preliminary investigation on the contribution and origin of organic
   halogens (measured as AOX) in sludges out of pulp and paper production
   is described. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and indirect
   enzyme-tests (cellulase) have shown remarkable differences in
   AOX-substances between various fractions of paper sludges. In sludges
   from factories with 100\% pulp usage (pulp sludges) chlorinated polymers
   from the pulp bleaching with chlorine were identified as main source. In
   sludges from companies with 100\% waste paper usage (waste paper
   sludges) strong indication has been presented that the main AOX-sources
   are contaminations in printing inks and smaller fragments of chlorinated

Abstract = {{Edible garden plants (carrots, spinach, and tomatoes) were grown to
   maturity inside continuous air-flow bioreactors, and were regularly
   irrigated with synthetic groundwater containing a mixture of
   C-14-labeled and unlabeled TCE. Two dose levels were tested (about 560
   mu g/L and 140 mu g/L.). Following TCE exposure for 31 to 106 days,
   different plant tissues and bioreactor compartments were analyzed for
   the C-14 label. Radiolabel recoveries ranged from about 50\% for
   low-dose reactors to about 70\% for high-dose reactors. Most of the
   recovered C-14 label volatilized (74-95\%) and was trapped in the
   Orbo(R) tubes that filtered the air exiting the reactors. A portion of
   the recovered label (5-25\%) was sorbed to the soil. Although the
   percentage of the recovered C-14 label found in plant material was
   relatively small (1-2\%), the concentration of C-14 label in edible
   plant tissue was higher than in the surrounding soil. On a harvest
   weight basis, accumulation factors ranged from 2.6 in high-dose tomato
   reactors to 32 in low-dose spinach reactors. If the radiolabel found by
   combustion of plants was TCE, the concentrations in edible tissue would
   range from 152 ppb for high-dosed tomatoes to 580 ppb for high-dosed
   spinach. However, neither TCE nor its commonly reported transformation
   products were detected by Purge \& Trap GC-MS. Furthermore, the C-14
   label found in plant tissue could not be extracted into the organic
   solvent CSI or into the inorganic solvent 10 N H2SO4. This suggests that
   TCE was taken up, transformed, and bound to plant tissue. Bound residues
   are generally believed to have lower toxicological effects than the
   parent compound. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The inhibition of microorganisms in an upflow anaerobic sludge bed and
   filter reactor was evidenced by a sudden decrease in methane production,
   a decrease in the chemical oxygen demand elimination, and an increase in
   the acetate concentration of the treated effluent. The inhibition
   occurred after a cumulative loading of 3486 mg of resin acids (66\%
   dehydroabietic acid and 34\% abietic acid) on 10 g volatile suspended
   solids of an anaerobic granular sludge. The acetoclastic methanogens
   were the most inhibited group of bacteria following the reactor failure,
   while the activity of the hydrogenotrophic methanogens was not affected.
   During the phase of 9.5 mg/L/d of resin acid feeding, no resin acids
   were detected in the effluent; sorption of resin acids on the sludge
   amounted to 6.6 mg/g volatile suspended solids. During the feeding phase
   of 59 mg resin acids/L/d, the effluent showed an average resin acid
   concentration of 19 mg/L; the toxicity was half that of the influent
   (Microtox toxicity tests). (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Total cell numbers, abundance of respiring bacteria and {[}(3)]thymidine
   and {[}C-14]leucine incorporation rates were investigated in four
   groundwater wells of low nutrient content. Total cell numbers in the
   pumped groundwater were low (14 x 10(3) to 279 x 10(3) cells mL(-1)),
   and {[}H-3]thymidine and {[}C-14]leucine incorporation rates were, with
   one exception, below the detection limit. Therefore we exposed sediments
   in situ for 2 months which allowed us to determine bacterial numbers and
   incorporation rates of labeled substrates by bacteria attached to
   sediment particles. The two habitats differed considerably in all
   bacterial parameters both in magnitude and seasonal trends. Total
   bacterial numbers of sandy sediments (52.1 +/- 21.3 x 10(6) cells
   cm(-3)) corresponded in average to 663 cm(3) of pumped groundwater (78.5
   +/- 61.5 x 10(6) cells L(-1)). For the fraction of respiring bacteria
   this ratio was on average 3032 cm(3) (sediments: 10.3 +/- 5.4 x 10(6)
   respiring cells cm(-3); groundwater: 3.39 +/- 6.01 x 10(6) respiring
   cells L(-1)). The percentage of respiring bacteria in sandy sediments
   was between 6.0 and 41.4\% (average 19.8) compared to 1.0 to 24.9\%
   (average 5.23) in the pumped groundwater. Our results stress the
   importance of studying the microbial communities attached to sediment,
   as pumped groundwater samples may not be representative for the real
   structure and dynamics of microbial assemblages in subsurface
   environments. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Riparian zones, located adjacent to intensely managed agricultural
   fields, are thought to play an important role in removal of nutrient
   contaminants including NO3- from groundwater. We studied the effect of
   Row rate, NO3- concentration and temperature on NO3- removal in soil
   columns under saturated-Row conditions. Bibb (coarse-loamy, siliceous,
   acid thermic Typic Fluvaquent) sandy loam soil was collected from a
   riparian forest located in Nomini Creek Watershed, Virginia. Soils
   included in the study were a permanently inundated surface horizon, a
   seasonally saturated surface horizon, a shallow subsurface horizon and a
   deep subsurface horizon. Soil columns were infiltrated with NO3- amended
   groundwater at concentrations from 14 to 36 mg NO3--N L(-1). Column
   operating temperatures varied between 8 and 20 degrees C and flow rates
   between 0.01 and 0.09 mL min(-1). Following a 48 h equilibrium period,
   effluent NO3- and N2O concentrations were determined. Denitrification
   was the primary mechanism of NO3- removal, with higher denitrification
   capacities found in the surface horizons. Effluent NO3- concentrations
   could be described by a linear combination of temperature, Row rate and
   influent NO3- concentrations. Low temperatures and increased Row rates
   reduced the denitrification capacity in all soils. Our results showed
   that the NO3- removal capacity present in the Bibb soil should
   theoretically be sufficient to remove most, if not all, NO3- from the
   groundwater at the Nomini Creek study site. However, on-site
   measurements of NO3- concentration in receiving streams indicated that
   this capacity is not fully realized in the field, suggesting the
   importance of other factors such as local hydrology and groundwater flow
   patterns. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The photochemical formation of carbon monoxide (CO) in various lake and
   wetland waters was found to be correlated with the concentration of
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC), as well as light absorbance and
   fluorescence of the waters, suggesting that dissolved organic matter is
   a major precursor for CO photoproduction. Rates of CO formation also
   increased nonlinearly with increasing concentration of dissolved iron.
   For the lake and wetland waters studied, CO production rates were
   between 13 and 910 nmol l(-1) h(-1) using June solar noon sunlight
   irradiations. Field experiments in a subtropical pond demonstrated that
   much of photochemically formed CO in the surface water was effluxed to
   the atmosphere. Considering the globally-averaged effective sunlight
   flux, we estimate that photoformation of CO leads to a turnover time of
   2-10 yr for DOC in sunlit surface waters. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Title = {{Influence of tide on water quality of lower Sebou polluted by Gharb
   plain wastes (Morocco)}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{859-867}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Demographic, industrial and agricultural development of Morocco during
   the last few years have often altered water quality. The Gharb district
   and particularly the Sebou river basin are among the most heavily
   polluted regions in Morocco.
   Oued Sebou collecting basin is 40,000 km(2), situated in north-western
   Morocco. Its water flows from the north-western slopes of the Middle
   Atlas range to the Atlantic Ocean. Its tributaries collect waters from
   the Rif range (Oued Ouerrha) and from central Morocco (Oued Beht). It is
   the main purveyor of water of the Gharb plain, a major agricultural
   region in Morocco, where fertilizers and pesticides are widely used.
   Along its banks, various industries (paper mills, sugar plants,
   tanneries, food industries, wool mills, chemical plants, etc.) have
   settled and contribute to the development of large towns which are not
   equipped with facilities for the treatment of either industrial or
   domestic waters. It is a real example of water pollution in a developing
   country.
   In order to assess the actual water quality of lower Sebou and to
   monitor both the effect of the release of pollutants and the influence
   of other factors, a wide pluridisciplinary research program on the
   biological, ecotoxicological and microbiological situation is in
   progress. Eleven stations have been selected: one on Oued Ouerrha (S1),
   one on Oued Beht (S6), one on Oued R'dom (S5) and eight on Oued Sebou,
   distributed along about 230 km (Fig. 1). The following paper reports on
   the physico-chemical quality of surface waters of lower Sebou, submitted
   to domestic, agricultural and industrial pollution and to tidal
   movements. Samples were analyzed for 17 parameters following AFNOR
   norms; 5 were determined on site (temperature, oxygen, pH, conductivity
   and salt content) while the others (DBO, DCO, MES, NH4+, NO2-, NO3-,
   Cl-, SO42-, PO42-, Ca2+, total hardness and alkalinity) were determined
   in the laboratory.
   Temperature does not vary significantly between different stations.
   Suspended matters levels were mainly dependent on hydrologic sequences
   of the rivers (low or high waters) and showed a wide range of seasonal
   changes. Because of decantation, the levels decreased from upstream to
   downstream, but after Kenitra, they increased again, because of solid
   wastes from the town and of a strong bottom tidal flow that pulls out
   deposited solid matter.
   Organic pollution is severe. Means of BOD5 vary from 19 to 76 mg/L and
   of COD from 39 to 180 mg/L. They can reach 135 mg/L for BOD5 and 834
   mg/L for COD. The worst situation is found downstream to Sidi Allal Tazi
   sugar plant. For dissolved oxygen, the lowest levels were found
   downstream to the town of Sidi Slimane (22\%) and to Sidi Allal Tazi
   sugar plant (38\%).
   Ammonium was mostly low (0-0.09 mg/L) while at downstream stations (8,
   9, 10, 11) there was a small increase, as well as at S6 (downstream to
   Sidi Slimane town). The presence of ammonium nitrogen is usually
   considered as figuring an uncompleted degradation of organic matter
   (Rodier, 1984). Nitrites followed the variations of ammonium. Nitrates
   showed a wide range of variations, possibly because of strong turbulence
   enhancing locally the oxygenation.
   In order to determine which were the main parameters that drove the
   ecosystem dynamics, a main components analysis was performed on the
   matrix given by the results of 8 campaigns at 11 sampling stations. The
   results are given in Table 1 and Fig. 5. It appears that tidal
   movements, and thus salt levels, are main factors upstream to Kenitra
   and downstream to Sidi Allal Tazi. The tidal phenomenon has been
   specifically studied (Fig. 5D and E). The confrontation of fresh and sea
   water in the Sebou mouth gives birth to a physical stopper which
   prevents polluted water from reaching the ocean and thus slows the
   improvement of water quality.
   Oued Sebou gives a good example under Mediterranean weather conditions
   of a severe pollution due to hydrochemical conditions strongly
   influenced by municipal and industrial wastes. Most of the
   physico-chemical parameters are higher than the values given by Nisbet
   and Verneaux (1970). Moreover, downstream, tidal influence contributes
   to further damage water quality. Efforts should be made to reduce toxic
   substances release in the Gharb plain. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of wastewater effluent from the secondary wastewater treatment
   plant of a dyeing and finishing mill is investigated for possible reuse.
   The treatment system employed in the present study consists of an
   electrochemical method, chemical coagulation and ion exchange. The
   electrochemical method and chemical coagulation are intended primarily
   to remove color, turbidity (NTU) and COD concentration of the wastewater
   effluent while ion exchange is employed to further lower the COD
   concentration and reduce Fe ion concentration, conductivity and total
   hardness of the wastewater. To enhance the efficiency of electrochemical
   method, addition of a small amount of hydrogen peroxide is found to be
   highly beneficial. Experimental results throughout the present study
   have indicated that the combined chemical treatment methods are very
   effective and are capable of elevating the water quality of the treated
   waste effluent to the reuse standard of the textile industry. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{We dissolved and fractionated the commercially available Aldrich humic
   acid (AHA) into less than 1000 and less than 8000 atomic mass unit (amu)
   fractions and used H-1 NMR to analyze the chemical forms of dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) of these two AHA fractions in D2O. The range of
   linewidths of the signals observed in the H-1 NMR spectra of the
   different molecular mass fractions suggests that DOM in the AHA
   solutions are mixtures of organic molecules of different molecular
   sizes. The spectrum of the less than 8000 amu AHA solution exhibited
   boarder linewidths and more pronounced aromatic character than the less
   than 1000 amu AHA solution. The association of DOM in these two AHA
   fractions and fluorobenzene (C6H5F) in D2O solutions as indicated by the
   translational mobility (self-diffusion) of fluorobenzene was examined
   using F-19 pulsed field gradient spin echo NMR. One fraction of the
   C6H5F molecules was found to have a diffusion coefficient comparable to
   that of fluorobenzene dissolved in AHA-free D2O and was assigned to the
   unbound Ca6H5F. The remainder, fluorobenzene, has a self-diffusion
   coefficient considerably smaller than that in AHA-free D2O and was
   assigned to the DOM-bound fractions. The magnitude of the self-diffusion
   coefficients of AHA-bound C6H5F decreases with increase in amu of the
   AHA fractions, suggesting sorption as a mechanism of C6H5F-DOM
   association. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The present study used a new model to analyse macroinvertebrate
   community changes along an organic pollution gradient in the River Trent
   system, U.K. The model divides community changes into four types, three
   of which are further differentiated into two sub-types. These type and
   sub-type variations are of different ecological significance. The
   results showed that as water quality deteriorated, species loss, the
   average abundance of sample-specific species and the average maximum
   ratio of in-common species abundance increased substantially, while the
   numbers of persisting species were reduced rapidly. However, polluted
   sites were also found to gain some tolerant species, particularly at
   slightly polluted sites. The abilities of several commonly used biotic
   indices to summarise these changes were compared. The design of the
   Chandler score system appeared to be more effective than the other
   systems examined. The Chandler-ASPT was modified by multiplying by log S
   (species richness/the number of key taxa) to improve its sensitivity
   over the lower range of water quality while retaining its effectiveness
   over the upper range of water quality. The modified index was tested
   using a published data set. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, investigations were made on the effects of organic
   substrate types and their load on phosphorus release. Reactors of three
   different sizes were operated, being fed on five kinds of organic
   substrates. The quantitative analyses were made on phosphorus release
   and substrate utilization under anaerobic condition. The molar ratios of
   the uptaken organic substrate to the released phosphorus were 0.5 with
   acetate, 0.6 with glucose, 0.8 with glucose/acetate, and 1.2 with
   glucose/acids, respectively. The phosphorus release was inhibited at the
   higher organic load than the steady state organic load. Both acetate and
   acids/glucose enhanced phosphorus release as well as uptake rate,
   however, the complete phosphorus removal was achieved after the complete
   microbial adaptation to the environment. With acetate, operation was
   hampered by the poor sludge settleability and phosphorus was not uptaken
   enough though the high phosphorus release was effective. With
   milk/starch, the phosphorus release and uptake were well developed even
   though phosphorus release was not comparatively high. From these
   observations, organic substrates, such as glucose seemed to convert into
   fatty acids after fast biosorption, and concurrent uptake of these acids
   by excess phosphorus removing bacteria followed. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{HOBr can be formed in various oxidation processes in engineered and
   natural systems. The rate of HOBr reduction by H2O2 is decisive to avoid
   formation of brominated organic compounds and bromate during ozone or
   hydrogen peroxide-based advanced or naturally occurring oxidation
   processes. From the pH dependence of this rate that was determined by
   stopped-flow measurements we conclude that either OBr- and H2O2 or HOBr
   and HO2- react with each other. Assuming that either one of the
   reactions takes place the corresponding second-order rate constants were
   determined to be k(OBr-,H2O2) = (1.2 +/- 0.2). 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) and
   k(HOBr,HO2-) = (7.6 +/- 1.3). 10(8) M(-1) s(-1). Mechanistic
   considerations lead to the conclusion that a nucleophilic attack of HO2-
   on HOBr must be the dominant reaction in the system. From the determined
   rate constants it can be estimated that the half-life for HOBr is less
   than a few seconds for a H2O2 concentration of 0.1 mg L(-1) (3 mu M) at
   pH 8. However, at a lower pH of 5, as encountered in cloud waters. the
   half-life of HOBr is several hours for the same H2O2 concentration. (C)

Abstract = {{A biochemical model for the anaerobic and aerobic carbon flow in
   phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAO) is discussed. It is based on the
   assumption that for the anaerobic poly(hydroxyalcanoates) (PHA) storage
   the reduction power is delivered by glycogen and the energy is supplied
   with hydrolysis of glycogen or polyphosphate. These have to be
   regenerated under aerobic or anoxic conditions which requires energy and
   releases carbon dioxide. Batch experiments with activated sludge from a
   pilot plant fed with domestic wastewater were performed. C-13 (in the
   form of acetate) was added and traced with solid state carbon NMR. The
   anaerobic formation of intracellular PHA from metabolised acetate
   together with degraded glycogen and the aerobic conversion of PHA to
   glycogen could be detected. The low ratio of acetate to carbohydrate
   conversion and the detection of poly(hydroxyvalerate) formed from
   glycogen shows that there is a substantial anaerobic breakdown of
   glycogen for energy production. The results from the NMR spectra also
   indicate that glycogen is degraded via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway.
   From the model it can be concluded that the maintenance of a glycogen
   and polyphosphate pool reduces the growth yield on substrate. This
   reduction depends on the type of substrate. It is estimated that for
   acetate there is a loss of biomass yield of about 12\% as compared to
   strictly aerobic conditions. The model also shows that glycogen as well
   as polyphosphate may serve for anaerobic energy supply, however with
   acetate as the only carbon source, polyphosphate is essential for
   growth. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Aerobic or denitrifying biological phosphorus removal in a sequencing
   batch rector(SBR) with short repetitive anaerobic-aerobic (A/O) or
   anaerobic-anoxic (A2) cycling has been studied. These conditions
   resemble processes with large internal recycle Bows. Under these
   conditions the fatty acid dosage per anaerobic phase is low compared to
   a conventional SBR or plug Bow process. It was shown that at the same
   sludge retention time (SRT) the average poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB)
   content of the biomass decreased, with increasing the number of A/O or
   A2 cycles. This had no direct effect on the biological phosphorus
   removal. In the A2 SBR, however, phosphorus removal was deteriorating
   due to transfer of nitrate to the anaerobic phase. Most mathematical
   models for biological phosphorus removal processes show a relation
   between the biomass growth rate and the PHB content. This research shows
   that such a unique relation does not exist, since at one SRT different
   `'steady state'' PHB levels could be obtained, depending on the cycle
   number and the use of oxygen or nitrate as an electron acceptor. This
   indicates the need for an alternative kinetic model. (C) 1997 Elsevier

   the temporal behavior of this reaction. The phases of reaction, gaseous

   determined by the solution pH. The presence of dissolved oxygen in
   aqueous solution plays a major role on the mechanisms involved,
   pyrolysis or free radical attack, for the decomposition of
   2-chlorophenol by sonolysis. The decomposition rate of 2-chlorophenol
   was found to be slightly reduced at higher solution temperature. A

   Evaluation (SITE) demonstration of an immunoassay for benzene, toluene,

   (South Portland, ME) as a semiquantitative test designed as a screening
   technology for classifying samples as above or below 25 ng/g BTX (the
   decision level). The immunoassay is simple to use, rugged, inexpensive,
   and produces on-site results in about 30 min. On-site immunoassay
   results for aqueous field samples were compared to laboratory-based gas
   chromatography (GC) results. Compared to the confirmatory GC results,
   the field sample false negative rate was 6\% and the false positive rate
   was 7\%. The immunoassay performed well as a screening tool for samples
   with BTX concentrations above 200 ng/g, but was inconsistent near the
   claimed 25 ng/g decision level. However, a small modification to the
   evaluation protocol is shown to screen for samples below 25 ng/g. The
   immunoassay provides adequate information for monitoring decisions such

   samples to identify either high or low BTX levels. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In drinking water treatment plants, process evaluation and water quality
   control are based on standard parameters such as DOG, BDOC, short or
   long term chlorine demand, oxidation by-products. Chlorine demand is one
   of the most important parameters because it allows the adjustment of the
   chlorination rate to maintain a residual concentration of active
   chlorine and to limit chlorination by-products. According to the results
   previously observed, the total reaction of chlorine with dissolved
   organic carbon requires prolonged contact times (several days or several
   weeks).
   In order to determine the chlorine demand in the water tanks and in the
   networks, the laboratory technicians are obliged to use a high chlorine
   dosage and to follow the decrease of residual chlorine over a very long
   time. The kinetic model described by Jadas-Hecart et al. (1992) (Water
   Research 26, 1073) leads to the determination of the long term chlorine
   demand of water by determining its chlorine consumption as a function of
   the reaction time and then calculating the kinetic parameters. The use
   of this kinetic model requires the strict observance of analytical rules
   in order to avoid any pollution of the samples. In addition to that,
   these experiments are time-consuming, which greatly limits the number of
   determinations.
   According to that, the objective of the present work was to develop an
   automatic analysis of the chlorine demand in order to reduce the risks
   of sample contamination while increasing the analytical possibilities.
   For this purpose, automation of long term chlorine demand measurements
   was achieved by coupling a Gilson sample changer with a Secomam
   spectrophotometer. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   disinfected pilot plant process waters did not result in increased HPC

Abstract = {{The use of powdered activated carbon treatment (PACT), based on
   simultaneous adsorption and biodegradation, is effective for treating
   organic toxic pollutants, present in industrial wastewaters. Removal of
   phenol and aniline from aqueous solutions by biological treatment alone,
   by adsorption on powdered activated carbon (PAC) alone and by
   simultaneous adsorption and biodegradation were compared. In the
   adsorption experiments, Langmuir adsorption isotherms were obtained,
   from which Q degrees, the limiting adsorption capacities, and b, the
   constant related to the energy of adsorption, were determined. Q degrees
   values of phenol and aniline were found to be similar, while the
   energy-related constant for aniline was five times higher than for
   phenol. Addition of mineral nutrients, needed for the biological
   treatment, and inactivated microbial cells increased the limiting
   adsorption capacities and significantly decreased the energy related
   constants. In biological treatment alone, kinetic studies showed that
   aniline was more resistant to biodegradation than phenol. In the
   simultaneous adsorption and biodegradation process, the PAC presence
   differently affected the biooxidation of phenol and aniline. While the
   PAC enhanced the microbial respiration in the phenol bioreactor, it
   significantly reduced the microbial respiration in the aniline
   bioreactor. Different organic removal mechanisms are suggested in PACT
   for phenol and aniline, due to their different energy of adsorption. The
   respirometric studies are recommended as an adequate tool for prediction
   of toxic organics removal capabilities from industrial wastewaters by
   PACT. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Concern over the release of colonized carbon fines from filters has

   The capture and release of carbon fines of two size ranges (1.2-50 mu m
   and 1.2-8 mu m) in biofilms and their impact on the biomass was studied
   using a bench-scale simulated drinking water system. Size of the
   particles was important, with large carbon fines (1.2-50 mu m) remaining
   in the biofilms while the small ones (1.2-8 mu m) were entrained and
   then detached. The presence of carbon fines did not influence the number
   or activity of bacteria present in the biofilms. Disinfection assays on
   biofilms containing particles were performed with chlorine (0.5 mg/L)
   and monochloramine (1 mg/L). Even in the presence of substantial numbers
   of carbon fines, the effect of the disinfectants on the biofilms as

   was limited. Carbon fines were released from the biofilms during

Abstract = {{A treatment strategy employing adsorption and solar assisted
   photocatalytic processes was field tested at Tyndall Air Force Base
   (Florida) for removal and destruction of organic contaminants in
   groundwater. The adsorbents were impregnated with photoactive catalysts
   and used in packed beds to remove pollutants from water for 18 h per
   day. The spent adsorbents were regenerated for 6 h per day in the
   presence of sunlight while passing hot water (90 degrees C) counter
   current to flow direction during the adsorption process. The organics
   that were not destroyed during regeneration by the catalyst-impregnated
   adsorbent were destroyed using a fixed bed photocatalytic reactor. The
   process was examined for 10 cycles of adsorption and regeneration for
   treatment of water contaminated with BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethyl
   benzene, o-xylene, m-xylene, and p-xylene) compounds. The efficiency
   (ratio of amount of organics removed to amount of organics adsorbed) of
   the process to regenerate the adsorbents was examined for each cycle. A

Abstract = {{A method of non-flame atomic absorption spectrometry for total arsenic
   concentration at trace level in liquid samples by the hydrides
   generation technique was developed. Separation of arsenic from liquid
   samples was done by reduction of samples using stanochloride. Argon was
   used as supporting gas. The detection limit in this method was 1 ppb.
   The method was checked on water samples taken from water-supply wells by
   determination of total arsenic level. The interfering influence of Au,
   Ag, Cu, Se and Fe on total arsenic concentration determination was also
   examined. Laboratory and semi-industrial devices for quick filtration of
   dissolved arsenic from well water were constructed. Single- and
   double-layer filters filled with quartz sand and anthracite with
   filtration speeds of 20 and 12 m(3)/h, respectively, were used. The
   average reduction of total arsenic concentration level of 42\% was
   attained. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of surface modification on the photocatalytic activity of two
   different commercial TiO2 catalysts is studied using different
   impregnation methods with platinum, silver and iron oxide. The Degussa
   P-25 TiO2 as received is more active than Aldrich TiO2, but the
   photocatalytic activity of Aldrich TiO2 can be greatly increased by
   surface modification with platinum or silver. No improvement in the
   photocatalytic activity has been observed for the Degussa P-25 TiO2
   impregnated with platinum. The most active photocatalyst for the
   trichloroethylene (TCE) destruction is Aldrich TiO2 loaded with 1.0 wt\%
   platinum using a photoreduction method. Similar destruction efficiency
   was obtained for the destruction of para-Dichlorobenzene (p-DCB) using
   platinized Aldrich TiO2 as catalyst. A kinetic model developed in this
   study can quantitatively describe the effect of light intensity and
   catalyst dosage on the photocatalytic oxidation of TCE. The reaction
   rate is proportional to the half-order of incident light intensity for
   the light intensity within the range studied (83.2-743.3 mW/L). The
   optimum catalyst dosage increases as the incident light intensity
   increases. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Two river waters (a lowland chalk stream and an upland river containing
   humic materials) and two soil waters (freely drained leachate to 135 cm
   depth and storm surface runoff, both from grassland soils) were
   fractionated into unfiltered <0.45, <0.22, <0.1 and <0.025 mu m using
   composite cellulose nitrate/acetate (CNA) membranes, under vacuum at 80
   kPa. Fractions less than 10,000 and 1000 molecular weight (MW) size were
   separated by ultrafiltration at 276 kPa. Molybdate reactive phosphorus
   (MRP) and dissolved organic carbon (DOG) were measured using the
   filtrates in each size range. In three of the four waters, the
   concentration of MRP in the portion <1000 MW was significantly smaller
   (P<0.05) than that determined in the fraction <0.45 mu m. In the soil
   surface runoff water, which was dominated by eroded mineral particles
   and colloidal organic material, the <1000 MW fraction represented 14\%
   of the total reactive P (TRP), and most of the reactive P was associated
   with the unfiltered (>0.45 mu m) fraction, being 71\% of the TRP. In
   contrast, 87\% of the TRP in soil leachate and 55\% of the TRP in the
   chalk stream water was <1000 MW, with significantly different but
   smaller portions in the range <0.45 mu m to >1000 MW. Particle and
   colloidal material plays an important role in the transformations of P.
   These findings are particularly novel for soils, where implications for
   mobility within the soil solution need to be considered. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The settling Velocity of a single hoc made of well-characterized
   kaolinite coagulated with aluminium sulfate was measured as a function
   of flee diameter in order to reconsider the Tambo's flee density
   function. Our analysis focused on the exponent n in the scaling relation
   between the settling Velocity and the floc diameter. A slight difference
   in n was observed when a different definition of hoc diameter in the
   projection was adopted. That is, the projected area was found not to be
   proportional to the square of the scales measured in the projection such
   as the maximum distance in projected flee or the Feret diameter. This
   result agreed with the tendency reported by means of numerical
   simulation. The range of n obtained in the present study consistently
   corresponded with that reported in the computer simulation. Uniquely
   small values of n reported by Tambo and Watanabe (1979) for
   kaolinite-aluminium flee were not observed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{In this paper, the disinfection effects of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) on
   some main viruses, algae and animal planktons in water and the;influence
   of ClO2 on the inactivation of some microorganisms studied under various
   conditions such as the dose of disinfectant, contact time, and pH value,
   etc. were researched and reported. The effects and influence were
   compared with liquid chlorine, and results showed that the killing
   effect of ClO2 on algae is about the same as or better than that of
   liquid chlorine and the inactivation effect of ClO2 on viruses and
   animal planktons is more remarkable than that of liquid chlorine. The
   viruses were effectively killed off by ClO2 in a wider pH range.
   Moreover, the mechanism of viruses killed by ClO2 was tentatively
   investigated. Then, it is concluded that ClO2 is an excellent
   disinfectant as a substitute for liquid chlorine. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The equilibrium partitioning concept for hydrophobic organic compounds
   (HOCs) predicts that organic carbon (OC) normalised or organic matter
   (OM) normalised HOC concentrations are approximately the same for
   different solid types sampled at the same time from the same surface
   water. This hypothesis was tested for polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH),
   polychlorobiphenyl (PCB) and pesticide concentrations in settling solids
   (sediment trap) and suspended solids (continuous how centrifuge) taken
   from Lake Volkerak and Lake Zoom (The Netherlands). It was found that
   settling solids had significantly higher OC normalised, or OM normalised
   HOC concentrations than suspended solids. Also, the degree of
   mineralisation as quantified by the OC-N atomic ratio of the organic
   material was significantly higher for the settling solids. The higher
   degree of mineralisation explains the higher normalised HOC
   concentrations in the settling solids, It was concluded that the ageing
   of organic matter during settling in the water column or after burial in
   sediments, may cause the increased fixation of HOCs onto organic
   particles. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{It was recently recognized that denitrifying bacteria, as well as
   aerobic bacteria, contribute to the biological phosphorus removal
   process. For evaluation of the phosphorus removal process it is
   necessary to have tests enabling a proper characterization of the
   microbial population in the activated sludge. In this study we evaluated
   the possibility of anoxic phosphorus release or aerobic/anoxic
   phosphorus uptake tests for sludge characterization. Hereto we employed
   sludge mixtures of enrichment cultures from laboratory sequencing batch
   reactor (SBR) systems operated under aanaerobic-aerobic (A/O) or
   anaerobic-anoxic (A2)conditions. It is shown that interpretation of
   phosphorus release tests, with or without nitrate present, is difficult.
   On the other hand a comparison of phosphorus uptake under aerobic and
   anoxic conditions leads to a straightforward characterization of the
   microbial population in the phosphorus removing organisms, with respect
   to their phosphorus removal activity under aerobic and anoxic
   conditions. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Batch experiments have been employed to develop a mathematical model for
   the aerobic growth of a known-denitrifier, Pseudomonas denitrificans, in
   the presence or absence of nitrate and/or nitrite. Specially designed
   batch experiments were used in order to evaluate the model's kinetic
   parameters. The aerobic growth kinetics, could be very well described by
   using double Monod expressions for the limiting substrates (organic
   carbon and oxygen). The proposed model is capable of describing
   accurately cellular growth, organic carbon utilization and oxygen
   transfer and utilization rates. The presence of nitrites and/or nitrates
   in the culture medium for the aerobic growth of P. denitrificans caused
   an intense decrease of the cell growth rate and the growth yield. These
   effects were accounted for in the kinetic model extending thus its
   validity for describing growth under aerobic conditions both in the
   absence and in the presence of various concentrations of nitrite and
   nitrate in the range of 0 to about 400 mg N/L. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A membrane bioreactor (MBR) is one of the application of membrane
   technology to wastewater treatments. A submerged MBR is a type of MBR in
   which membrane modules are directly submerged into a bioreactor. Because
   the uplifting air flow is assigned the role of cake removal in a
   submerged MBR, aeration could affect the cake-removing efficiency and
   hence suction pressure. This study, therefore, examined the effect of
   aeration on cake removal and suction pressure using a pilot-scale
   submerged MBR and concluded that aeration was a significant factor
   governing the filtration conditions. Judging from the observed flow
   velocity of uplifting air measured with an electromagnetic flow velocity
   meter, cake-removing efficiency of the uplifting air flow was affected
   by the turbulence of the how. The cake-removing efficiency was improved
   either (1) by augmenting an air flow rate or (2) by augmenting aeration
   intensity (an air how rate per unit door area) by concentrationg
   membrane modules over a smaller floor area. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

   biological methods in the study of the exchange between the canalized
   Rhine river and its riverside aquifer. The infiltration of Rhine water

   the micropollutant mercury. One method made use of the aquatic
   macrophyte communities as bioindicators of the degree of eutrophication
   based on phosphorus and nitrogen, and the second method, the capacity of
   the bryophytes to accumulate mercury. The results obtained with both
   methods show that bioindication using autochthonous aquatic macrophyte
   species can be used as an efficient method in river-groundwater exchange

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Bioremediation of oil-contaminated beaches typically involves
   fertilization with nutrients that are thought to limit the growth rate
   of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria. Much of the available technology
   involves application of fertilizers that release nutrients in a
   water-soluble form prior to bacterial uptake. Oil contamination of
   coastal areas from offshore spills usually occurs in the intertidal
   zone. This area is subjected to periodic flooding by a combination of
   tides and waves, which can affect the washout rate of water-soluble
   nutrients from the contaminated area. We used lithium nitrate as a
   conservative tracer to study the rate of nutrient transport in a
   low-energy, sandy beach on the southwestern shore of Delaware Bay. The
   rate of tracer washout from the bioremediation zone (i.e. the upper 25
   cm below the beach surface) was more rapid when the tracer was applied
   at spring tide (when the tidal amplitude is largest) than at neap tide,
   but the physical path taken by the tracer plume was not affected.:In
   both cases, the tracer plume moved vertically into the beach subsurface
   and horizontally through the beach in a seaward direction. The vertical
   transport was probably driven by waves infiltrating through the
   unsaturated zone. Hydraulic gradients that were established by
   differences between the rate at which the elevation of the water table
   in the beach changed and the rate at which the tide rose and fell
   contributed to horizontal movement of the plume. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Paralytic shellfish poisons (PSPs) extracted from the cyanobacterium
   Anabaena circinalis persisted for over 90 days when incubated in
   freshwater. The primary transformation reaction was
   desulfocarbamoylation of the predominant, low toxicity C-toxins, to the
   more potent decarbamoyl-gonyautoxins (dc-GTXs). This transformation
   caused an initial increase in sample toxicity, in spite of an overall
   decrease in total toxin concentration (on a molar basis) with time.
   Incubation of PSPs in irrigation drainage water resulted in a six-fold
   increase in toxicity after 10 days, with the solution remaining more
   toxic than the original solution for over 60 days. The dc-GTXs thus
   formed, and the gonyautoxins (GTXs) present in the original sample,
   degraded slowly for the duration of the 90 day incubations. Similar
   results were recorded when PSPs were incubated with sterile deionised
   water, and with sterile deionised, protein precipitated water, but the
   build-up of dc-GTXs proceeded at a slower rate than with the drainage
   water. The other reaction noted to be significant was the slow
   epimerisation of the less stable beta-epimers (C2, GTX3) to
   alpha-epimers (C1, GTX2). The degradation of C-toxins, gonyautoxins
   (GTXs) and dc-GTXs could be modelled by simple first-order loss
   kinetics. When PSPs were incubated at 90 degrees C, the same loss
   processes and reaction order was observed. The failure of protein
   precipitation and high temperature to alter the reaction processes,
   indicates that desulfocarbamoylation of C-toxins, and degradation off
   GTXs and dc-GTXs is chemically, and not enzymatically, mediated. Upon
   the collapse of PSP producing A. circinalis blooms, and the subsequent
   release of toxins into the water column, contaminated water may become
   more toxic in the short term before the eventual degradation of PSPs to
   non-toxic products. Unless significant dilution occurs, PSP contaminated
   waters may contain toxins for more than 3 months. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Anaerobic digestion of the organic food fraction of municipal solid
   waste (OFMSW), on its own or co-digested with primary sewage sludge
   (PSS), produces high quality biogas, suitable as renewable energy. We
   report the results from one such bench scale laboratory experiment on
   the co-digestion of OFMSW and PSS. The experiment used a continuously
   stirred tank reactor and operated at 36 degrees C for 115 days. Prior to
   the experiments, activity tests verified that the inoculum sludges were
   suitable for the biodegradation of the volatile fatty acid substrate and
   so producing biogas. The experimental data were used to develop and
   validate a two-stage mathematical model of acidogenesis and
   methanogenesis. In simulating the behavior of the anaerobic digestion
   process, including ammonia inhibition, the mathematical model
   successfully predicts the performance of methane production, Simulations
   of the pH and ammonia in the MSW anaerobic reactor were also
   satisfactory. Sensitivity analysis on the 18 model parameters indicated
   that eight of these parameters were in the most sensitive and highly
   sensitive range, while the remainder were in the moderate to least
   sensitive range. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Title = {{Distribution and characterization of dissolved organic matter of surface
   waters}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{541-553}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to characterize and compare the dissolved
   natural organic matter (DOM) of various river and reservoir waters. The
   determination of the `'hydrophobic/hydrophiric DOM distribution'' was
   used in parallel with more related drinking water parameters to compare
   the selected waters (i.e. chlorine and ozone reactivity).
   The `'hydrophobic/hydrophilic DOM distribution'' also called
   `'humic/non-humic NOM distribution'' of eight natural surface waters,
   four reservoir waters and four river waters, was determined by
   fractionating the organic matrix into three fractions onto two
   superposed XAD-8 and XAD-4 resin columns at acidic pH, the hydrophobic
   substances (i.e. humic substances) that adsorbed onto the XAD-I resin,
   the hydrophilic acids that adsorbed onto the XAD-4 resin, and the
   non-adsorbed hydrophilic solutes that are contained into the XAD-4
   effluent. The `'hydrophobic/hydrophiIic DOM distribution'' was
   determined based on DOC or UV-254 nm measurements.
   The structural characterization of the NOM was completed by the
   determination of its biodegradable disserved organic carbon (BDOC)
   content and its apparent molecular weight distribution using a 1000
   dalton cutoff ultrafiltration membrane. Batch ozonation and chlorination
   were conducted on the various surface waters to compare their ozone
   demand and chlorine reactivity (chlorine demand, TTHM and TOX formation
   potentials).
   The waters collected from the reservoirs were found to be richer in DOC
   (6.8-7.8 mg l(-1)) and showed higher UV-254nm absorbance values
   (0.22-0.29cm(-1)) than the waters sampled from the rivers (2.8-5.3 mg
   l(-1) of DOG, UV-254 nm absorbance ranged from 0.057 to 0.15 cm(-1)).
   Whatever the origin of the water, the higher the DOG, the higher the UV
   absorbance. However, a better correlation was obtained between these two
   parameters when considering the two groups of waters separately.
   The `'hydrophobic/hydrophilic DOM distribution'' showed that the DOC of
   both reservoir and river waters was evenly split between the hydrophobic
   and the hydrophilic fractions. Nevertheless, the hydrophobic fraction
   (i.e. humic substances) was found to be proportionally more abundant in
   reservoir waters (51-62\% of the DOG) than in river waters (41-50\% of
   DOG). This observation correlates well with the fact that the relative
   UV absorbance (also called specific UV absorbance: UV Abs.1/mg C) of the
   studied reservoir waters was generally higher than the relative UV
   absorbance of the studied river waters, since humic substances are known
   to be the most aromatic NOM fraction. On the contrary, data have also
   shown that the non-adsorbed hydrophilic fraction was significantly more
   abundant in rivers (23-26\% of the DOG) than in reservoirs (14-21\% of
   the DOG). One can note that the hydrophilic acids represent a pseudo
   constant fraction whatever the origin of the water (24-28\% for seven of
   the eight surface waters).
   The presence of suspended sediments in rivers may explain the
   predominance of hydrophilic substances for this group of surface waters
   because of possible interactions (adsorption properties) between
   suspended materials and humic substances (hydrophobic organic fraction).
   The Loire river which corresponds to the largest river we have studied
   (rich in suspended sediments) was characterized by the lowest
   hydrophobic organic content, 40\% of the DOG, a proportion that is
   similar to the ones previously observed by Semmens and Staples (1986)
   and Collins et al. (1986) for the Mississippi river and the Colorado
   river, respectively.
   Using a 1000 dalton ultrafiltration membrane no significant difference
   was observed between the apparent molecular weight distribution of the
   DOC of both river and reservoir waters. Organics above l000 daltons
   generally accounted for up to 70-80\% of the DOG. Results obtained with
   the Loire river were significantly different showing 50\% of the DOC
   below 1000 daltons as compared to 20-30\% for the other waters. These
   data are of particular interest because, according to the XAD-8/XAD-4 I
   isolation procedure, the more hydrophilic the NOM, the lower its
   apparent molecular weight.
   One could note that the biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC)
   accounted for approximately 15\% of the DOC of the studied waters. If
   one could expect that higher the hydrophilic organic content, the higher
   the BDOC content, no significant correlation was established between
   these two parameters.
   Reservoir waters were found to be more reactive with chlorine and ozone
   than river waters. The higher the UV-Abs or DOC of the water, the higher
   the ozone demand, chlorine demand, TOXFP, and THMFP. A reasonably good
   correlation was obtained between the ozone demand and chlorine demand.
   Regarding the DPB formation potentials, TTHMFP accounted for
   approximately 25\% of TOXFP. Taking into account the DOC content of the
   different waters, the relative TTHMFP and TOXFP (mu g Cl mg(-1) C) were
   determined to be generally (with few exceptions) higher for the
   reservoir waters than for the river waters. However, no direct
   correlation between the hydrophobic organic content (i.e, humic
   substances content) and the DPB formation potentials could be
   established. Indeed, results of our previous works (Croue et al., 1993b)
   have shown that THMFP and TOXFP of hydrophilic acids and fulvic acids
   (90\% of the humic substances) were similar. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{An artificial waste water containing phenanthrene and Tween 80(x) was
   treated in the horizontal-vertical flow macrophyte-based treatment
   system. The pilot plant consisted of a cascade of five steel tanks
   filled with lava, each tank planted with Typha spp, and Scirpus
   lacustris. The overall removal of phenanthrene in water was about
   99.9\%. Adsorption of phenanthrene was primarily observed in the upper
   lava layer. 1-Hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (HNA) as a bacterial metabolite
   of phenanthrene was quantified. An MPN(most probable number)-method for
   the enumeration of phenanthrene-degrading bacteria was modified by
   staining degradation products formed in the culture media with diazonium
   salts. The number of phenanthrene-degrading bacteria was highest in the
   first tank of the cascade. The number of total bacteria remained nearly
   constant within the cascade. The amount of bacteria in lava exceeded
   that in water by a factor of 10(3). The number of phenanthrene-degrading
   bacteria in lava samples in a phenanthrene-loaded tank was approximately
   10(6) g(-1), and 10(2) g(-1) in a non-loaded tank. Furthermore, tracer
   experiments were conducted in 1993 and 1994. The mean residence time was
   determined to be 1.18 days (1993) and 1.15 days (1994) in the first
   tank, and 6.66 days (1993) and 6.4 days (1994) in the whole cascade. The
   experimental values agreed approximately with the theoretical values of
   1.27 days and 6.54 days. The Peclet numbers agreed with those of the
   dispersion characteristic of the lava filling as a porous medium. (C)

Abstract = {{Few measurements of the dissolution of individual polychlorinated
   biphenyl (PCB) congeners dissolved from Aroclor mixtures in water have
   been reported, and there is no available information on how the aqueous
   solubilities of these compounds are affected by their presence in
   organic liquids such as hydraulic oils. A series of experiments were
   performed to study the dissolution of specific PCB congeners from
   Aroclor 1242 alone and from mixtures of Aroclor 1242 in an hydraulic oil
   (Fyrquel 220). Batch dissolution experiments were performed for time
   periods up to 20 weeks. The principal solutes from Aroclor 1242 were
   dichlorobiphenyls and trichlorobiphenyls, for a total PCB concentration
   of approximately 97 mu g/L. In comparison to the composition of pure
   Aroclor 1242, the distribution of the mass of PCB congeners in the
   aqueous phase comprised significantly more dichlorobiphenyl congeners
   with less tetrachloro- and pentachlorobiphenyl congeners. PCB congener
   dissolution from 5\% v/v Aroclor in hydraulic oil was decreased
   substantially relative to that observed for the pure Aroclor.
   Dissolution of PCBs from Aroclor and Aroclor/hydraulic oil mixtures
   occurred in approximate proportion to the congener pure liquid
   solubility and the mole fraction in organic liquid. This work
   demonstrates for a pure Aroclor and Aroclor mixtures in hydraulic oil
   that the aqueous leaching potential is skewed towards the
   lower-chlorinated homologs. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A point-of-use (POU) water treatment system (WTS), comprised of a
   pressed activated carbon block filter followed by an ultraviolet (UV)
   light reactor, was evaluated for microbial disinfection efficacy
   following the general guidelines of the United States Environmental
   Protection Agency Guide Standard and Protocol for Testing
   Microbiological Water Purifiers. The POU WTS was challenged against
   bacterial, viral and protozoan waterborne pathogens including Vibrio
   cholerae, Shigella dysenteriae serotype 2, Escherichia coli O157:117,
   Salmonella typhi, hepatitis A virus strain HM 175, poliovirus type 1
   strain Lsc2ab, simian rotavirus SA11, Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts,
   Giardia lamblin cysts and coliphage MS2. The POU WTS was tested for the
   removal/inactivation of each challenge organism in separate 16-to 20-day
   test periods under various conditions of water quality, at the system's
   maximum recommended flow rate and at 70\% of the lamps normal UV
   intensity. For each organism tested, microbial challenges were conducted
   over the course of the test period at 0, 50, 100 and 150\% of the system
   manufacturer's rated water treatment capacity. Each microbial challenge
   consisted of 30 L of influent water containing approximately 10(5)
   bacterial cfu/mL, 10(4) viral pfu/mL or 10(3) protozoan cysts/mL.
   Influent and effluent water samples were taken during the challenges and
   assayed for the particular pathogen and the percent reduction
   calculated. Effluent water samples were also taken and assayed for the
   possible presence of the pathogens following two 60-h stagnation
   periods. The POU WTS was found to effectively remove and/or inactivate
   greater than 99.9999\% of the bacterial pathogens, greater than 99.99\%
   of the viruses and greater than 99.9\% of the protozoan cysts and
   oocysts tested to 150\% of the water treatment capacity of the POU WTS.
   These findings suggest that a properly designed and operated POU WTS may
   be a practical approach to removing microbiological waterborne pathogens
   From drinking water. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Two different carbon substrates (ethanol and acetic acid) were compared
   in order to set up the denitrification of a concentrated industrial
   wastewater (115mM nitrate, 0 mM nitrite). Two stirred anaerobic reactors
   were carried out in continuous flow culture mode: one using ethanol as
   carbon source, and the other using acetic acid. The microorganisms,
   selected from the factory lagoon, were a mixed culture of Pseudomonas
   sp. and cocci sp. The variation of the dilution rate allowed the
   evaluation of the specific growth rate of the bacteria. In the two
   cases, the denitrification was complete. The experiments have shown that
   the development of the microorganisms was higher on ethanol, but on
   acetic acid, the specific denitrification rate was higher. The high
   specific denitrification rate observed with acetic acid was explained by
   the fact that acetic acid is a directly assimilable carbon source. The
   ethanol must be first changed into acetate. This study's application is
   a fluidized bed pilot plant for the industrial wastewater treatment. (C)

Abstract = {{Biological wastewater treatment systems comprise a variety of processes
   which occur at vastly different rates. Biological growth, mass transfer,
   hydraulics and chemical reactions all occur simultaneously and are all
   inter-dependent. In this paper we address the question `'to what extent
   can we de-couple these processes, and what are the associated issues? We
   aim to introduce people who work with biological wastewater treatment
   models to analytical tools which may be used for model reduction. We
   present a quantitative technique to compartmentalise states into fast,
   medium and slow. From this we have provided an algorithm for eliminating
   state variables from a model based on whether they affect the process in
   the selected `'time scale of interest''. Through the technique presented
   we provide a means of quantifying the interaction between state
   variables, the `'speed'' of a state and whether it is it candidate for
   reduction. A simple case study of a biological wastewater treatment
   process is presented. We were able to reduce four biological and 19
   settler differential equations into algebraic equations. This resulted
   in significant savings in integration time. Application of the technique
   also highlighted the strong coupling between the slower biomass states
   and the rest of the model. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the disinfection effects of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) on
   some main bacteria in water and the influence of CLO(2) on the
   inactivation of some microorganisms studied under Various conditions
   such as the dose of disinfectant and the contact time, pH value, etc.
   were researched and reported, and it was compared with that of liquid
   chlorine. The results showed that the killing effect of the CLO(2) on
   bacteria is similar to or better than that of liquid chlorine, the
   bacteria were effectively killed off by using CLO(2) in a relatively
   wider range of pH value. Moreover, the investigation of the bactericidal
   mechanism of CLO(2) was tentatively undertaken. Then, we concluded that
   CLO(2) is an excellent disinfectant to substitute for the liquid
   chlorine. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of decomposing barley straw at c. 25 g m(-3) in a disused

   was simultaneous with the release of a `'cocktail'' of phytotoxic
   chemicals, following both the initial immersion of the straw and then
   after a c. 3 month period of degradation in water. The toxicity of straw
   leachate to phytoplankton could be explained by the presence of
   toxicologically relevant levels of phenols and oxidised phenolics.
   Optimisation of the control of phytoplankton using barley straw is
   discussed with respect to observed environmental physicochemical

Abstract = {{The spatio-temporal dynamics and removal efficiency of
   pollution-indicator (total coliforms, fecal coliforms and fecal
   streptococci) and some opportunistic pathogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa and Aeromonas spp.) were studied in two high-rate oxidation
   ponds (HROP) A and B pilot-plants. The more evident component of the
   pollution-indicator bacteria dynamics in HROP effluents was an annual
   periodicity, based on higher concentrations in winter than in summer.
   The temporal dynamics of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria studied in
   HROP effluents was more complex than that of fecal-indicator bacteria.
   While a 6- or 4-month periodicity appeared, respectively, in the
   effluents of HROP A and B for Aeromonas spp. abundance, no particular
   trends were highlighted by chronological analyses for Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa. Removal efficiency of fecal-indicator bacteria by HROP
   reached a maximum in summertime and a minimum in wintertime. On the
   other hand, for each season, removal efficiency was always higher when
   the retention time is the longest. The relatively low removal of
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aeromonas spp. showed that HROP efficiency
   should be improved. When HROP sanitary performance was compared to that
   of conventional wastewater treatment lagoons (CTL) located in the same
   area, it appears that HROP is the most efficient treatment system. On
   the other hand, HROP operates with specific load of 500 kg COD/ha/day
   (vs 100 kg COD/ha/day for CTL). Thus, the required surface area is five
   times smaller for HROP than for CTL. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A new drinking water treatment train has been developed in the water
   treatment plant at Sant Joan Despi (Barcelona). It takes the raw water
   from the Llobregat river, which supplies water to Barcelona city and
   surroundings. We studied the efficiency of the different steps in this
   plant for the removal of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC).
   The processes, at the beginning of the monitoring, were break-point
   prechlorination, flocculation-sedimentation, filtration through granular
   active carbon (GAG) and postchlorination. A sand filtration step and an
   ozonation step, between sand filtration and GAC filtration, were then
   added. Results show that the combined effect of the processes between
   raw and sand filtered water caused a significant decrease in dissolved
   organic carbon (DOG), while it had no effect on BDOC. The ozonation
   process significantly increased BDOC. Finally, GAC filtration
   significantly decreased DOC and BDOC. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the effects of ozone, ozone-hydrogen peroxide and
   catalytic ozone were assessed from changes in the organic constituents
   of a synthetic solution of fulvic acids. Initial DOC and BDOC
   concentrations of the fulvic acid solution were 2.84 mg L(-1) and 0.23
   mg L(-1), respectively. Oxidation tests were performed according to the
   Ozotest method, which provides an assessment of the extent of oxidation.
   Ozone, ozone-hydrogen peroxide and catalytic ozone mineralized 15\%,
   18\% and 24\% of the initial DOG, respectively. The oxidation system
   that generated the highest BDOC concentrations was ozone-hydrogen
   peroxide, while catalytic ozone produced the lowest concentrations (with
   ozone doses greater than 3.5 mg L(-1), BDOC levels were 0.90 mg L(-1),
   0.80 mg L(-1) and 0.60 mg L(-1) for ozone-hydrogen peroxide, ozone and
   catalytic ozone, respectively). Catalytic ozone induced oxidation of
   ozone by-products into CO2, and led to the greatest reduction in
   chlorine demand. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   possible to assess the overall impact of a wastewater treatment plant
   effluent on a sedimentary area in a microcosm. Nitrobacter combined with
   discharge particles (10(10) cells g(-1) dry hoc) can settle in
   freshwater sediments in a week (106 cells g(-1) dry sediment). If

   lake in France. A slight depletion of Sb(V) in the surface water is
   observed. The concentration is about 0.1 nM at the surface and it is
   about 0.35 nM. at depths in the oxic water column of the mixolimnion. In
   contrast, an enrichment of Sb(III) at the surface is observed. The
   concentration is about 0.1 nM at the surface and it is undetectable at
   depths. Both Sb(V), thermodynamically stable species, and Sb(III),
   thermodynamically unstable species, are equally important species at the
   surface. At the depths, on the other hand, Sb(V) is the only detectable
   species in accordance with the thermodynamic prediction. A possible
   perturbation induced by biological activity is suggested. In the anoxic

Abstract = {{We have produced an adherent defect TiO2 film reactor in which the
   performance is greatly improved by the application of a small positive
   bias (electric field enhancement) to boost hydroxyl radical production.
   In the reactor the light, electric field and photocatalyst combined to
   disinfect water containing Clostridium perfringens spores and
   Escherichia coli; Singly, neither light, the electric field or the
   combination of light and fixed film could significantly reduce the
   numbers of indicator bacteria. We believe that water disinfection using
   an immobilised titanium dioxide film photochemical reactor with electric
   field : enhancement could provide an effective and energy efficient
   source of hydroxyl radicals for water disinfection. (C) 1997 Published

Abstract = {{The levels of contamination of various organochlorine pesticides such as
   HCHs, DDTs, aldrin, dieldrin and endrin were determined in marine and
   estuarine sediments along the west coast of India. The concentration of
   various pesticides in sediments from the mouth of different estuaries
   along the coast were in the range of 0.85-7.87 ng/g (t-HCH), 0.10-0.26
   ng/g (aldrin), 0.70-3.33 ng/g (dieldrin), 0.42-0.95 ng/g (endrin) and
   1.47-25.17 ng/g (t-DDT), whereas those in the offshore sediments in the
   range of 0.10-6.20 ng/g (t-HCH), 0.09-0.26 ng/g (aldrin), 0.2-1.41 ng/g
   (dieldrin), 0.39-0.78 ng/g (endrin) and 1.14-17.59 ng/g (t-DDT). Among
   the organochlorine pesticides, t-HCH and t-DDT were most dominant in
   both the estuarine and offshore sediments. The highest concentration of
   t-HCH was estimated at station 8 near the mouth of Netravati estuary
   (7.87 ng/g) while that of t-DDT at station 7 near the mouth of Kali
   estuary (21.16 ng/g). Among the cyclodiene compounds, aldrin was in
   abundance in most of the sediments whereas dieldrin and endrin could be
   detected at the mouth of Zuari, Damanganga, Diu, Cannanore and Ponnani
   estuaries along the west coast of India. The mean concentrations of
   t-HCH, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin and t-DDT increased in the estuarine
   sediments by factors of 2.95, 1.13, 3.60, 2.26 and 2.18, respectively,
   with respect to those in the offshore sediment. The most predominant
   metabolites of DDT and HCH in both the estuarine and the offshore
   sediments were found to be pp'-DDE and alpha-HCH respectively. Copyright

Abstract = {{A method of deriving BMWP (Biological Monitoring Working Party) scores
   and indicator values that incorporates the effects of abundance rating
   and site type is presented. This is an extension of earlier work by the
   authors, which reappraised overall BMWP family scores using biological
   data from the 1990 River Quality Survey of England and Wales. The method
   is only briefly explained but its formulation in mathematical terms is
   fully documented. Full details are given of the overall, site-related
   and site-abundance-related derived scores and indicator values of 34
   selected families. New definitions of average score per taxon (ASPT)
   based on the derived scores and indicator values are presented, and the
   potential impact of these on existing BMWP site scores and ASPTs is
   briefly examined via two examples. Some interesting variations in the
   derived scores with respect to site type and abundance rating are noted,
   and explanations of these are given from an ecological point of view. It
   is concluded that the method described offers a means of significantly
   improving the reliability and hence utility of the BMWP score system.

Abstract = {{Storm run-off is a source of acute toxicity leading to fish mortality.
   The lethal main factors involved are hypoxia and the presence of
   ammonia. A series of experiments was carried out on juvenile rainbow
   trout exposed to ammonia and low concentrations of dissolved oxygen.
   Survival data analysis and generalized linear models were used to model
   the laboratory data obtained. A quantitative model of the instantaneous
   death probability as a function of time, concentrations of un-ionized
   ammonia and dissolved oxygen was obtained. The model was fitted with
   data obtained at a temperature of 17 degrees C with concentrations of
   un-ionized ammonia between 0 and 0.5 mg/l, concentrations of dissolved
   oxygen between 1.7 and 2.9 mg/l and time less than 24 hours. The
   survival probability of rainbow trout exposed simultaneously to
   un-ionized ammonia and low dissolved oxygen was found to be lower than
   the predicted survival probability derived from the addition of
   individual effects of both ammonia and hypoxia. This kind of model can
   be used to understand the toxic impact of run-off and to draw up
   guidelines for the management of urban storm water. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{An innovative treatment process using high energy electrons has been
   shown to be effective for the destruction of various toxic (regulated)
   organic chemicals. This paper presents data for the destruction of
   chlorinated methanes, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and methylene
   chloride in treated groundwater. The studies were conducted at pilot
   scale, using a 75 kW electron beam at a how rate of 0.38 m(3) min(-1)
   This study examined the effect of solute concentration and total
   alkalinity on removal efficiency. A kinetic model was used to describe
   the results of single solute experiments of the three chlorinated
   methanes. These model predictions were then compared to experimental
   results and showed a varying degree of predictability for the three
   compounds. These calculations suggest that the initial reactions which
   eventually lead to the mineralization of the three chlorinated methanes
   result primarily from aqueous electron initiated reactions. The
   subsequent reaction between O-2 and the carbon centered radicals with
   the formation of alkyl peroxides also appears important for their
   ultimate decomposition. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In regards of the protonations of uracil and halogenouracils (Al
   Iskandarani et al., 1995), the experimental conditions of analysis was
   determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (Fig. 1) and UV
   spectrometry (Fig. 2).
   The chlorination of a 10(-1) M uracil solution was followed at pH 6 and
   at 20-22 degrees C using increasing concentrations in sodium
   hypochlorite. After 60 min, the chlorination yields a mixture containing
   a large quantity of 5-chlorouracil when the molar concentration ratio R
   = {[}H2UH]/{[}ClO-] is equal to the unity. After this maximum (similar
   to 80\% {[}H2UH]), the 5-chlorouracil disappears for reaching total
   decomposition when R = 6 (Fig. 3). A similar behaviour is noted when the
   chlorination is carried out in presence of a 10(-3) M sodium chloride
   solution. In presence of added sodium iodide or sodium bromide, the
   chlorination leads to produce in addition to 5-chlorouracil, important
   quantities of 5-iodouracil (similar to 90\% {[}H2UH] at R = 2) (Fig. 4)
   and 5-bromouracil (similar to 50\% {[}H2UH] at R = 3) (Fig. 5),
   respectively.
   5-Iodouracil, 5-bromouracil and 5-chlorouracil completely disappear to
   form byproducts when R = 20 and R = 14, respectively. These observations
   show that the addition of iodide ions slackens the disappearing of the
   uracil, stabilizing the concentration of the 5-chlorouracil at about
   55\% of the initial uracil concentration at R = 10. This effect is
   accentuated in presence of bromide ions which limit the concentration in
   5-chlorouracil to nearly 10\% {[}H2UH] at R = 6.
   A similar behaviour at different levels is observed, when the initial
   uracil solution contains an equimolecular mixture of iodide and bromide
   ions (Fig. 6). Moreover, the competitive formation of 5-halogenouracils
   produces maximum concentrations at R = 2.5 and R = 7 for 5-iodouracil
   and 5-bromouracil, respectively. The level of the 5-chlorouracil
   concentration remains low (similar to 8\% {[}H2UH]) at R = 14. The
   complete disappearance of all products is reached at about R = 20.
   The halogenouracils are probably formed by addition of hypohalite groups
   XO(-) to the C-C double bond of uracil. It seems clear that existence of
   hypobromite and/or hypoiodite ions was an oxidation result of bromide
   and/or iodide ions by sodium hypochlorite. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

   coprecipitation of phosphorus with calcite was shown by energy
   dispersive X-ray analysis. The content of phosphorus in the calcite was
   about 0.1 wt\%. Phosphorus was homogeneously distributed throughout the
   precipitated calcite and throughout the calcinated particles of water
   and sediment. The phosphorus coprecipitation efficiency was calculated
   from the ratio of the decrease of phosphorus to decrease of calcium in
   the water according to the House's coprecipitation model. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Relatively limited information is available regarding the kinetics of
   sorption of organic compounds from solution onto flyash. For this
   reason, a detailed study of the kinetics of sorption of o-xylene on
   flyash was conducted in a controlled batch system. The effects of solute
   concentration, particle size of the adsorbent, and temperature on the
   adsorption rate were investigated. The results of this research
   demonstrate that the adsorption reaction can be approximated to
   first-order reversible kinetics. A significant correlation was observed
   between the rate of adsorption and the inverse of the square of the
   particle diameter. An examination of thermodynamic parameters shows that
   the adsorption of o-xylene by flyash is an exothermic process and is
   spontaneous at the temperature investigated. Activation energies for the
   sorption process ranged between 3.1 and 4.3 kcal/mol. The rate at which
   o-xylene is adsorbed onto flyash was found to be controlled by the
   diffusion process. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Respirometric film bag relies upon reoxygenation of a wastewater sample

   fabricated by interposing two layers of polyethylene membrane in between

   collapsible mouth of the film bag. The film bag provides a shallow depth
   liquid housing for the wastewater sample. The film bag was initially
   standardised and rate of oxygen transfer, when the sample in it is not
   stirred, was modelled based on an analogy between conduction of heat
   through infinite bodies with surface and internal resistance. Oxygen
   uptake study of up to 250 mg/l BOD5 may be carried out with or without
   imparting stirring action to the wastewater sample. In the oxygen uptake
   studies, DO versus time plots (DO profiles) were obtained. The course of
   oxidation of organic contents in the wastewater may be obtained.

Abstract = {{The concentrations of copper and iron in surface water of the eutrophic
   Lake Kasumigaura, the second largest lake in Japan, have been monitored
   at three sites monthly from April 1989 until March 1994. The metals were
   analyzed by a graphite furnace AAS after filtration with a 0.45-mu m
   membrane filter. The concentrations of copper in the water were in the
   range 10(-9) to 5 x 10(-8) M and showed clear seasonal changes, being
   higher in summer and lower in winter. The concentrations of copper did
   not decrease on passage through the lake. The values of dissolved
   chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) showed a similar behavior, an interaction
   of copper in the lake water with organic matter was estimated. The
   concentration of copper in the lake became sometimes higher than the
   value of EC(50) for Microcystis, however, the metal forms stable complex
   species with organic matter and the toxic effect may be reduced. The
   concentrations of iron, on the other hand, showed wide variation, but no
   obvious seasonal change. The concentrations of iron decreased very
   markedly during flow of water through the lake. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{A total of 116 samples from numerous aquatic sources including water
   from faucets, showerheads, dental units, fire sprinklers, and surface
   waters were examined for the presence of Legionella by the EnviroAmp(R)
   Legionella PCR Kit, culture on BCYE alpha, or direct fluorescent
   antibody (DFA) staining. In addition, 58 ground water samples collected
   across the U.S. were also examined for the presence of Legionella
   species by PCR and by culture on BCYE alpha and BCYE alpha-GVPC. Of the
   58 ground water samples tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay,
   93\% were positive by PCR, while only 7\% were culture positive.
   Analysis of the remaining samples indicated that 52.7\% of the samples
   were positive by PCR, 50.0\% were positive by DFA, while 8.3\% were
   culture positive. Although Legionella species were frequently detected
   by PCR in all water types examined, concentrations were typically less
   than 10(3) cells per ml. Legionalla species were detected much more
   frequently than was Legionella pneumophila in all aquatic samples. DFA
   results correlated well to PCR results but culture results were often
   negative for Legionella due to overgrowth, competition, or inhibition by
   background organisms. Results of this type of survey confirm the
   ubiquity of Legionella in aquatic environments, even ground waters. This
   study represents the first in depth survey of ground water across the
   United States. Copyright (C) 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Creosote a mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), typically
   becomes depleted of low molecular weight compounds once in the
   environment. Previous studies indicated that PAH toxicity increased with
   increasing molecular weight up to phenanthrene: heavier compounds were
   less toxic than phenanthrene, possibly due to their limited solubility.
   A high molecular weight fraction (HMWF) of creosote, with a composition
   similar to environmentally weathered creosote, and a low molecular
   weight fraction (LMWF) were obtained by distillation. Fish were exposed
   to suspended sediments contaminated with each fraction for 10 days.
   Samples of fish were removed on days 2, 4, 7 and 10, observed for gross
   pathological abnormalities, weighed, measured, and the livers analyzed
   for ethoxyresorufin O-de-ethylase (EROD) activity. Mortality, epidermal
   lesions, fin erosion, and temporary induction of EROD activity occurred
   in fish exposed to the HMWF. No mortality, fin erosion, or induction of
   EROD activity occurred in fish exposed to the LMWF or uncontaminated
   sediment. Fish exposed to the LMWF did develop lesions, but only in the
   area surrounding the mouth, nares, and opercula. These results suggest
   that the environmental toxicity of creosote is due to the high molecular
   weight compounds. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Hollow fiber stripping analysis (HFSA), a modification of closed loop
   stripping analysis (CLSA), is introduced for the extraction, detection
   and identification of trace levels of both volatile and low volatility
   organic compounds in water. The method uses a bank of microporous
   hydrophobic hollow fiber membranes as the air/water contacting device in
   a closed, dual-recirculating system. Method design and optimization are
   presented. Application of membrane extraction for detection of tow
   nanogram per liter (parts per trillion) concentrations of taste and odor
   causing compounds in water is presented. These compounds can be a
   particular problem in water as they are detected by water consumers at
   these very low concentrations, and are perceived as being indicative of
   poor water quality. Method detection limits, precision and accuracy are
   presented for four known taste and odor causing compounds. HFSA displays
   an advantage over CLSA in detection of lower volatility compounds, and
   in greater reproducibility. HFSA is also able to avoid foaming problems
   that occur in CLSA during analysis of waters with high surfactant
   concentrations. Higher volatility compounds are detectable at
   concentrations similar to CLSA. HFSA is shown to be a reliable, precise
   and accurate tool for extraction and determination of low nanogram per
   liter concentrations of low molecular weight organic compounds with
   dimensionless Henry's Law constants down to approximately 0.001 from a
   complex natural water matrix. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model of granular media filtration has been constructed
   based on an adaptation of the Carman-Kozeny equations for flow in porous
   media to the cells of a non-homogeneous media, and a consideration of
   the capture probability when a particle passes close to a filter grain.
   The model was based on a matrix of five size fractions and five pore
   voidages. The suspended solids also comprised five size fractions. The
   shear stress on the deposit was calculated at each time increment in
   each cell for each size fraction, and if this exceeded given limits
   either deposition was inhibited or the solids were Rushed out. All
   coefficients used have a physical significance. The resultant
   calculations produce a striking simulation of the behaviour found in
   real filters such as the formation of `'wormholes'' in the clogged
   layers, breakthrough when the flow is increased on used filters, a
   linear increase in headless with time, etc. A new form of maturation
   resulting from the redistribution of flow in the matrix has also been
   identified. The work was undertaken with the aim of producing a general
   model that might be used by designers to predict all aspects of filter
   behaviour. While there may be much more that could be done some progress
   would appear to have been made. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Acute toxicity, accumulation and excretion of isoprothiolane and its
   degradation products (isoprothiolane sulfoxide, diisopropyl
   chloromalonate and diisopropyl dichloromalonate) were studied for
   killifish (Oryzias latipes). The 48-h LC(50) was 5.9 mg l(-1) for
   isoprothiolane, 35 mg l(-1) for isoprothiolane sulfoxide, 4.8 mg l(-1)
   for diisopropyl chloromalonate and 7.1 mg l(-1) for diisopropyl
   dichloromalonate. The toxicities of the isoprothiolane degradation
   products were nearly equal to or lower than that of isoprothiolane. The
   bioconcentration factors (BCF) in the whole body of the fish were 45 at
   low concentration and 40 at high concentration for isoprothiolane, 0.2
   for isoprothiolane sulfoxide, 0.2 for diisopropyl chloromalonate and 0.7
   for diisopropyl dichloromalonate. As reference data, partition
   coefficients between n-octanol and water (P-ow) were measured for these
   compounds. Log P-ow was 3.16 for isoprothiolane, 2.05 for isoprothiolane
   sulfoxide, 2.45 for diisopropyl chloromalonate and 3.44 for diisopropyl
   dichloromalonate. The excretion rate constants (k) from the whole body
   of the fish were 0.32 h(-1) for isoprothiolane and 0.79 h(-1) for
   diisopropyl dichloromalonate. The results suggest that the contamination
   of fish and other aquatic organisms by the isoprothiolane degradation
   products in the environment is low. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Through batch sorption tests with synthetic solutions, it was found that
   aluminum hydroxide has a significant sorptive capacity for
   orthophosphate, condensed phosphate and organic phosphate. In all tests,
   except that with organic phosphate at pH 3.6, the measured soluble
   aluminum was consistent with solutions saturated with solid-phase
   Al(OH)(3). With organic phosphate at pH 3.6, an aluminum-organic
   phosphate precipitate appeared to form. A theoretical analysis of
   Al(OH)(3) and Al(PO4) precipitation showed that orthophosphate removal
   is not achieved through Al(PO4) precipitation when dosing with
   conventional alum, but rather through a mixed aluminum hydroxide
   phosphate precipitate. Jar tests performed with alum sludge and
   wastewater showed that phosphate is removed almost exclusively by the
   particulate fraction of the sludge. The removal of reactive phosphate
   (orthophosphate) decreased with an increase in the storage time of the
   alum sludge. This decrease was not seen with the non-reactive phosphate.

Abstract = {{Results from a preliminary study into the effects of magnetic treatment
   on calcium carbonate formation are presented. A test rig was constructed
   to investigate the effect of orthogonally applied magnetic fields on
   solutions of calcium carbonate, with specific reference to changes in
   scale deposits formed. Results are compared with those of a reference
   system identical in every way other than the application of the magnetic
   field. The results from this study indicated that magnetic treatment
   significantly influenced the deposition of calcium carbonate scale,
   under the controlled physicochemical conditions employed. A scale
   reduction of 48\% was recorded when the system was uncontrolled compared
   with negligible change when the system pH was controlled. In the
   uncontrolled system pH was shown to drop initially during magnetic
   treatment compared to that of the reference system. A pH regulated at 8
   and 8.5 led to increased scaling and reaction rate but any effect
   magnetic treatment had on scale formation was apparently destroyed. It
   was concluded that pH plays an important role in the mechanism by which
   magnetic fields affect scaling in flowing systems. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{Although the mechanisms are not fully understood, magnetic treatment of
   water systems has been in existence for over a century. One of the major
   applications is to suppress water-scale deposition on the inner surface
   of boilers, heat exchangers and pipelines. Three dynamic rates play
   important roles in the crystallization process: these are association,
   dissociation and nucleation rates. In this paper we report on a series
   of laboratory experiments concerning the formation of calcium carbonate
   from super-saturated solution. The results indicate that under certain
   conditions in the presence of an external magnetic field, the nucleation
   rate can be greatly increased. This was observed as a rapid onset or
   `'burst'' of crystallization within the bulk solution, and can be
   quantitatively described as the scattering of incident light-the
   so-called Tyndall effect. As a consequence of the faster precipitation
   in the presence of the magnetic field, the resultant crystals are
   greater in number, with smaller sizes and irregular shapes. This
   observation is in agreement with an earlier report on a different
   magnetic treatment method. Copyright (C) 1996 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{A simplification of the standard bivalve embryo-larval bioassay method
   for seawater quality assessment is described. Methodological features
   aimed to increase reliability, sensitivity and accuracy, and to reduce
   time and costs, include: induced natural spawning to guarantee gamete
   quality, earlier exposure to the test solutions and direct observation
   without subsampling. In the first example of application, embryos of
   oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were
   used to compare the adequacy of artificial and natural seawater for the
   incubation of bivalve larvae. An average of 91-93\% of the embryos
   developed normally in all cases, and there were no significant
   differences between species or between the two waters tested, concluding
   that both species and both types of water are equally suitable for
   ecotoxicological monitoring purposes. In the second example the C. gigas
   embryo-larval bioassay was used for the assessment of the water quality
   in 15 tributaries of an oyster farming area: the Bay of Arcachon.
   Methods can be applied to freshwater ecotoxicological studies. Copyright

Abstract = {{Many problems encountered in water filtration are associated with the
   effectiveness of backwashing. Combined air and water backwashing
   especially using flow rate combinations resulting in
   `'collapse-pulsing'' provide the most effective cleaning. This study
   examines a technique of analysing pressure signal fluctuations in order
   to determine the onset of `'collapse-pulsing''. The technique provides a
   non-subjective and practical method of `'collapse-pulsing''
   determination. The resultant pressure fluctuation traces are examined in
   combination with headless versus water velocity profiles at particular
   set air flow rates. The occurrence of significant fluctuation patterns
   at the position where headless becomes constant implies that
   `'collapse-pulsing'' determined by this technique is the onset of three
   phase fluidisation. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   Danfoss electrode. From the regression equations, a current of 2.97 mA
   at 25 degrees C for water-saturated air was determined as being
   equivalent to a value of 8.68 mg DO L(-1) for the Danfoss sensor. From a
   regression of log phi (mu A mg(-1) L(-1)) versus t (degrees C), a
   constant (m) and intercept (b) for water-saturated air was obtained, the
   values being 0.0263 and -0.759, respectively. A linear relationship with
   a high correlation coefficient for the salt content of the samples at
   different temperatures was obtained. The field measurements of DO showed
   that this system was reliable for the unattended monitoring of DO for 70

Abstract = {{By means of rigorously controlled lab-scale activated sludge systems
   operated in parallel, the affect of the addition of a nutritive
   supplement on the overall performance of these systems was verified.
   Nutriflok 50 S is a commercially available product. containing nutrients
   and flocculating agents. In a first series of tests by means of SCAS
   (semi-continuous activated sludge) reactors, fed with synthetic
   wastewater, the positive effect of the supplement (dosed at 5\% of the
   chemical oxygen demand (GOD) load) on the sludge volume index (SVI)
   (39\% improvement) and the residual COD (40\% improvement) was
   demonstrated. In a second series, an industrial wastewater was used in a
   benchscale set-up according to the OECD procedure. The overall
   efficiency and sludge sedimentation characteristics were compared for
   two parallel activated sludge systems continuously fed with
   pharmaceutical wastewater. In the control no additive was given; the
   other reactor received on a daily basis a dose of Nutriflok 50 S
   corresponding to 10\% of the COD load. The performance of the Nutriflok
   50 S supplemented reactor was found to be statistically better in terms
   of sedimentation characteristics, nitrification and COD removal than the
   control. Especially when operated under winter conditions (10 degrees C)
   and at higher sludge loading rates (Bx = 0.26 kg COD/kg VSS.d) the COD
   removal efficiency was about 35\% higher in the treated reactor.
   Moreover, nitrification could be maintained in the supplemented reactor
   at low temperatures, whilst it became minimal under those conditions in
   the control reactor. Also in the second series of tests, sludge
   sedimentation characteristics improved with Nutriflok 50 S. The SVI was
   40\% lower for the Nutriflok 50 S amended sludge and the recycled sludge
   was 27\% more concentrated. When operated at higher temperatures (20-26
   degrees C) the amended sludge was less sensitive to denitrification
   linked flotation in the settler. Microscopic examination of the sludge
   revealed a more diverse microbial community and the presence of higher
   trophic organisms in the supplemented reactor. These results indicate a
   potential for considerable improvement, not only of the overall
   conversion efficiency, but also of the sludge management characteristics
   when Nutriflok 50 S is dosed to the activated sludge. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{Changes in the numbers and the composition: of the microbial population
   in a pilot-scale membrane anaerobic reactor system were studied during
   14 weeks operation. The membrane reactor was inoculated with the sludge
   taken from a digester of a municipal wastewater treatment plant. An
   initial epifluorescent microscopic examination of the seed sludge
   revealed that the most dominant group was Methanococcus followed by
   Methanosarcina, short rods, medium rods, filaments and long rods.
   Changes in the composition of the dominant methanogenic species were
   observed throughout the operation. Methanococcus species were found to
   be the most dominant group at the end of the study followed by medium
   rods, short rods, Methanosarcina, long rods and filamentous species. The
   numbers of both methanogens and non-methanogens were found 50\% and 20\%
   increased in the reactor after 14 weeks operation while the numbers of
   viable methanogens sharply increased, i.e. 20 times, resulting in a 50
   times increase in the metabolic activity of the fluorescent methanogens.
   Within the fluorescent methanogenic population, Methanosarcina,
   Methanococcus, Methanobacterium and Methanobrevibacteria species have
   been tentatively identified. Acclimatization of the digester sludge was
   completed after 40 days operation after which the COD removal efficiency
   of the system was found to be over 98\% showing that a satisfactory
   microbial population had been established in the digester. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Phenol and its homologues are aromatics containing hydroxyl, methyl,
   amide and sulphonic groups attached to the benzenoid molecules. These
   molecules are, both, anthropogenic and xenobiotics. Phenols are
   environmental pollutants discharged through wastewaters from fossil fuel
   refining processes, phenol manufacturing plants, pharmaceutical and a
   variety of other industries. Phenols are toxic to several biochemical
   reactions. However, biological transformation of phenols, to non-toxic
   entities exists in specialized microbes, having enzymes of aromatic
   catabolic pathways. Transformation of phenols is also inhibited by the
   presence of other toxic materials such as cyanides and sulphides that
   are present in the industrial wastes having phenols as the dominant
   carbonaceous material. Kinetics of the biotransformation of phenols
   using pure cultures isolated in the laboratory, mixture of a consortium
   of the pooled cultures and enriched activated sludge biomass in pure
   substrates, mixed substrates and actual phenolic waste has been
   estimated under varying input concentrations. Experimental results from
   these studies have been subjected to analysis by mathematical models
   using Monod's and Haldane's equations to test the validity of these
   models in interpreting the data on inhibitory substances under steady as
   well as unsteady state operations of wastewater treatment plants.
   Comparative evaluation of the kinetic parameters reveals that Monod's
   model can be employed for the estimation of the kinetic constant mu only
   while Haldane's model has to be used for the calculation of mu(max) and
   K-1. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

   effluent from mature silage at 1/1000 dilution, whilst the glucose
   sensor proved more suitable for detecting effluent from freshly ensiled
   grass, which contains higher levels of sugar than mature silage. In both
   cases the sensor response was within 60 s of exposure to the effluent.
   The potential of biosensors for rapid monitoring in the water industry

Abstract = {{Concentrations of several major ions in pore waters, extracted by
   centrifugation after manipulation in air, were significantly lower than
   those obtained after similar treatment under a nitrogen atmosphere.
   These differences are probably due to the oxidation of ferrous sulphide
   in air, which increases SO4 in solution. The corresponding reduction in
   Fe2+ reduces competition for sorption sites on the solids so that more
   major cations are sorbed. Even more determinands (major ions and
   nutrients) showed significantly higher concentrations in samples frozen
   under air compared to unfrozen samples manipulated in air. In frozen
   samples, cell rupture probably released additional CO2 into solution
   which resulted in higher Ca and alkalinity concentrations. The higher Ca
   concentrations increased competition for sorption sites with consequent
   increases in other cations in solution. Frozen and unfrozen samples
   manipulated under nitrogen showed no significant differences in major
   ion chemistry due to the large variability between samples. The latter
   probably results from a variable re-equilibration of CO2 with CO2-free
   nitrogen compared with air containing CO2. In the samples studied here,
   k(d)(Sr) in frozen samples is likely to be a factor of 2 lower than in
   unfrozen samples. For Cs, k(d)(Cs) could be up to an order of magnitude
   lower in frozen samples, due to release of ammonia. Hence separation of
   pore water by freeze-thawing is not a reliable method for in situ kd
   estimation. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results obtained in wastewater denitrification
   studies using methane as sole carbon source under two different
   conditions-i.e. in the presence of oxygen and under strict anoxic
   conditions. In the latter case, no significant denitrification was
   observed. However, in the presence of oxygen, a successful
   denitrification was obtained in batch reactors with a denitrification
   rate reaching 0.6 kg N-NO3- kg(-1) VSS per day. It was shown that
   nitrate consumption could not be solely attributed to nitrogen
   assimilation and from 5 to 75\% of the initial N-NO3- was escaping from
   the reactors in gaseous form. An important wasteful methane oxidation
   (indirectly related to denitrification) was also observed reaching in
   some experiment 90\% of the total methane oxidation. The system obtained
   appeared to consist of an association of methanotrophic bacteria,
   oxidising methane and producing one or several intermediate organic
   compounds, still unidentified, which are later consumed by the
   denitrifying bacteria. No evidence was found for the involvement of
   methanol or acetate as intermediates, as suggested by the literature.

Abstract = {{Bioconcentration factors, uptake rate constants (k(1)), and clearance
   rate constants (k(2)) were determined for bromo- and chlorobenzenes with
   the mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis). The values of k(1) and k(2) on a
   lipid weight basis ranged from 3500 to 47,000 d(-1) and 1.50 to 0.27
   d(-1), respectively. The rate constants exhibit good nonlinear
   correlations with the n-octanol/water partition coefficient (K-ow). The
   bioconcentration factors reach a maximum at pentachlorobenzene (log K-ow
   = 5.2) and then decline. The bioconcentration factors on a lipid weight
   basis (K-BL) correlated well with K-ow. The bioconcentration kinetics
   can be described by equivalent mass transfer models and experimental
   data indicate that the mass transfer process in the lipid phase is the
   rate-limiting step in the bioconcentration process. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{A ceramic membrane coupled to a bioreactor has been used in a dual role,
   combining the alternate functions of system aerator and filter for
   remediating food industry process waste. The 0.2 mu m membrane provided
   markedly superior aeration to a traditional sparger and kept permeate
   suspended solids below 50 mg l(-1), despite an input of 1510-3800 mg
   l(-1). At 25 degrees C (typical waste-stream temperature), with COD
   inputs of 13,330 mg l(-1) and BOD5 6500 mg l(-1), reductions in excess
   of 95\% were obtained. Ammonical nitrogen was reduced from 9-10.2 mg
   l(-1) to <0.3 mg l(-1) and total phosphorus from 20-21.2 mg l(-1) to <4
   mg l(-1). With membrane aeration, the indigenous microflora, which
   built-up to over 10(9) cfu ml(-1), included lactic acid bacteria which
   helped reduce the impact of periodically high pH (>9) wastes due to CIP

Abstract = {{The sorption and subsequent desorption from soil particles, of
   tefluthrin, a widely used soil-active pyrethroid insecticide, were
   studied in a simulated rainfall runoff system. Experimentation was
   facilitated by use of the C-14-labelled compound. The desorption of such
   highly hydrophobic organic compounds from soils has rarely been reliably
   determined previously. Sorption results showed that the partition
   coefficients (K-p and K-oc) were determined with good precision;
   although the resultant coefficients were shown to be underestimates of
   true adsorption to soil due to non-attainment of true equilibrium and
   the presence of colloidal material in the aqueous phase supernatants
   analysed. Once the adsorption slurries were diluted (30 mi of aqueous
   phase to 3.51) to simulate transport of soil to a larger water body
   after heavy rainfall, kinetic studies, using a centrifugation method,
   indicated that the soil phase concentration decreased once more, whilst
   at the same time a biphasic re-equilibration process occurred in the
   aqueous phase. A direct particle counting method was used to rapidly and
   reproducibly measure desorption of C-14-tefluthrin from soil under
   contrasting experimental conditions. Initial re-equilibration was shown
   to be rapid when soil-to-water ratios were changed significantly,
   temperature having a pronounced effect on this desorption. The results
   are important for the accurate modelling of tefluthrin behaviour in the
   environment. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{A system of gas- and light-permeable sealed sample bags was employed to
   monitor the fate and persistence of the color and organochlorines (AOX)
   exiting the secondary treatment systems of three modern pulp and paper
   kraft mills. Placed in a remote lake at various depths, the bags of
   effluent showed that the `'stable'' biotreated AOX from elemental
   chlorine-free bleaching was largely but not completely mineralized in 4
   months, largely by sunlight-dependent processes. Mill AOX and color was
   partially protected from photomineralization by natural organic matter
   (NOM) in the water. Effluent chromophores were more rapidly and
   completely degraded by light than AOX, and neither AOX nor color were
   very susceptible to biological degradation. The biotreated effluents,
   even when undiluted, were not acutely toxic and over time gave rise to
   diverse, flourishing microalgal, protozoan, and metazoan communities in
   the sealed bags. Thus these concentrated effluents apparently had no
   acute or chronic toxicity for a diverse assemblage of aquatic organisms
   over a 4-month period. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Concentrations of water quality constituents in urban stormwater are
   often expressed in probabilistic terms-using statistics such as the mean
   and standard deviation and selected quantiles. In many studies, the
   log-normal distribution has been assumed to apply. In this 3-year study,
   the distributions of concentrations of 14 constituents in five sources
   of run-off were studied-parking-lot run-off discharging into an
   on-stream pond, baseflow and event flow in a small suburban creek
   feeding the same on-stream pond, and the pond outflow under both
   baseflow and event flow conditions. Two Probability distributions,
   log-normal and normal, were fitted and the goodness-of-fit was assessed
   using probability plots and the Cramer-von Mises test. Of the two, the
   log-normal was the better distribution in most of the cases tested. It
   was more suitable for parking-lot run-off and creek baseflow, and
   somewhat less suitable for creek event flow and pond baseflow. With a
   few exceptions, the log-normal distribution did not apply for soluble
   constituents (total dissolved solids, chlorides, sulphate, COD) and/or
   event outflow from the pond. In these cases the normal distribution was
   preferred. The composition of outflow from the pond was controlled by
   intense mixing of the incoming event run-off with the water stored in
   the pond. The assumption of an inappropriate probability distribution
   can result in substantial errors when estimating the mean concentration
   for censored data. This in turn can affect calculation of pollutant
   loads and extrapolation to estimate quantiles. Copyright (C) 1996

   sludge (mixture of primary and secondary sludge) digestion and metal
   leaching (SSDML) process was studied in shake flasks (500 mi capacity)

   bioreactor studies demonstrated that an increase in sludge solids
   concentration increased the sulfuric acid production rates in the range
   of solids 8 to 30 g/l. The metal solubilization efficiency (Cu, Mn, Ni
   and Zn) during the SSDML process in the bioreactor was not affected by
   sludge solids concentration to a large extent, except Cd, Cr and Pb,
   which were less soluble at increased solids concentration. The sludge
   solids content, in the range of 16 to 30 g/l did not affect the sludge
   solids (total; solids, volatile solids, total suspended solids and
   volatile suspended solids) reduction during the SSDML process operation
   at bioreactor scale. The fertilizer value of the processed sludge
   remained intact. Tests in shake flasks and bioreactors demonstrated that

Abstract = {{This research presents a methodology for coupling microsectioning of
   biofilms, the subsequent extraction of DNA from the biofilm sections,
   and the analysis of the DNA by gene probes to determine the distribution
   of phenol-degrading organisms in the biofilm. A mixed species biofilm
   was grown in an aqueous feed that simulates a municipal wastewater.
   Frozen biofilm samples were sliced parallel to the substratum, using a
   cryostat. From representative layers of the biofilm sectioned parallel
   to the biofilm substratum, ethidium bromide dot tests on extracted DNA
   and radioactively labelled DNA probes {[}toluene-3-monooxygenase (tbu)
   or toluene dioxygenase (tod)] were used to examine the distribution of
   total bacterial organisms and phenol-degrading organisms, respectively,
   in the biofilm. The concentration of total bacterial DNA increased
   significantly as depth increased, for biofilms over 300 mu m thick
   (depth from substratum to biofilm-water interface). Under conditions of
   stress (decreasing organic feed), however, the relationship began to
   fail. As with total bacterial DNA, DNA from phenol degraders showed a
   direct relationship with depth. The results of this study confirm that
   biofilm sectioning followed by DNA extraction provides suitable samples
   for genetic probing. Results of genetic probing reflect the
   heterogeneity of the biofilms grown in this study. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{The reasons behind the lowering of the spectrophotometrically measurable
   silicon (Si) content in sediment interstitial and unfiltered lake water
   samples after storage in frozen form were explored. The storage
   container material had little effect on the immobilization, whereas
   lowering the pH of interstitial water samples before freezing decreased
   the `'loss'' of Si. When interstitial water samples were frozen, both
   native, naturally present Si and added standard solution Si were
   immobilized. The same reaction pattern was found for native Si in
   unfiltered lake water samples. On the contrary, neither the native Si in
   filtered lake water nor added standard solution Si was immobilized when
   lake water samples were frozen, indicating that high concentrations of
   particulate material, especially in the interstitial water, was the
   prime cause of the immobilization phenomenon. The results obtained in a
   sequential filtration (0.2 mu m, 100,000 and 10,000 daltons) experiment
   with interstitial water samples supported the theory that Si is
   immobilized through polymerization or complex formation mediated by
   particulate material and molecules present in interstitial water. An
   incubation test revealed that the immobilization process was not
   entirely reversible. The amount, nature and behaviour of Si in
   interstitial water samples showed some seasonal variation. Copyright (C)

Year = {{1997}},

Abstract = {{Seven 1 ha grazed lysimeter plots, managed as intensive grassland for
   the last 12 years, were monitored for total phosphorus (TP) and
   molybdate reactive phosphorus (MRP) in surface runoff plus interflow to
   30 cm depth, for up to ten events during 1994. The mean MRP and TP
   concentrations determined were 40 and 122 mu g l(-1), respectively, but
   the data were heavily skewed by low frequency high intensity events.
   Thus concentrations of MRP and TP of over 1200 and 1700 pg l(-1)
   respectively were determined in extreme events, causing a TP export of
   up to 18 g ha(-1) per h and, during one event of 30 h duration, over 0.5
   kg TP ha(-1) was estimated to have been removed, representing a
   significant proportion of the triple super phosphate fertiliser added 6
   days earlier. One storm was monitored at 3 h intervals and the patterns
   for TP concentration and TP load were closely related to discharge. MRP
   concentration did not follow the hydrographic pattern. Excluding the low
   frequency high intensity events, an empirical model TP (mu g
   l(-1))=58+{[}42 x discharge] (1 s(-1)) was postulated, which although
   significant (P = 0.0053), only accounted for 14\% of the relationship.
   It was thus concluded that understanding of release mechanisms in the
   majority of high frequency, low intensity events is inadequate.
   Conversely, during one period of high phosphorus (P) export, the
   mechanisms responsible were suggested to be a combination of the
   presence of cattle (excretal returns and poaching), timing of inorganic
   P fertiliser additions, and intensity of rainfall. Grassland soils are a
   significant source of diffuse P inputs to surface and estuarine waters
   and may cause eutrophication. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{A system consisting of two identical biofilters aerated in cycles was
   used to achieve nitrification and phosphorus removal. The influent
   contained 12 mg/L NO3-N, 10 mg/L NH4-N, 50 mg/L COD and 8.5 mg/L P. The
   specific su;face area of the packing media was approximately 140
   m(2)/m(3) and the empty bed residence time (EBRT) in each biofilter was
   maintained at 34 min. The two biofilters were exposed to alternating
   unaerated/aerated conditions in cycles. The flow direction was reversed
   at the end of each cycle and the influent was always introduced into the
   unaerated biofilter. The aeration cycle duration (CD) was varied in the
   range of 3-12 h. Varying the CD had significant impact on the
   performance of the system and resulted in environmental conditions which
   inhibited or enhanced nitrogen;and phosphorus transformations. Carbon
   removal, nitrification, denitrification, and phosphorus release and
   uptake were dependent on the CD. The results demonstrate the role of CD
   in creating environmental conditions suitable for optimising phosphorus
   removal and modifying nitrogen transformations in biofilters. Copyright

Abstract = {{The adsorption characteristics of the bed sediments collected from the
   River Kali in western Uttar Pradesh, India, have been studied for the
   uptake of lead and zinc ions. The parameters controlling the uptake,
   viz. initial metal ion concentration, the solution pH, sediment dose,
   contact time, and particle size have been evaluated. The adsorption of
   metal ions increases with increasing initial metal ion concentration.
   The adsorption of the two metal ions on the bed sediments follows two
   phases: a linear phase of adsorption and then a quasi-equilibrium state
   (almost flat plateau). The quasi-equilibrium state was attained within
   45 min for both the metal ions. It is observed that the extent of
   adsorption increases with the increase of pH of the solution and metal
   ion concentration decreases with increase in pH value. Further, the
   adsorption of metal ions increases with increasing adsorbent doses and
   decreases with adsorbent particle size. The geochemically important
   elements such as Fe and Mn have also been determined in various grain
   size fractions of the sediments and correlated with the adsorption of
   metal ions. The adsorption data of the two metal ions has also been
   analysed with the help of the Langmuir and Freundlich models to evaluate
   the mechanistic parameters associated with the adsorption process, viz.
   monolayer capacity and sorption intensity. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Stable anaerobic digestion of settled instant coffee wastewater was
   achieved for over 100 days in mesophilic (35 degrees C) and thermophilic
   (55 degrees C) UASB reactors. Thermophilic upflow anaerobic sludge:
   blankets (UASBs) were seeded with mesophilic granules and converted to
   thermophilic operation by raising the temperature to 55 degrees C in one
   step. Successful thermophilic operation was achieved within 28 days.
   Both mesophilic and thermophilic UASBs achieved stable digestion at
   organic loading rates (OLR) of up to 10 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) (hydraulic
   retention times (HRT) 24 h). Higher OLRs to the mesophilic: resulted in
   reactor failure due to increasing total volatile fatty acid (TVFA)
   levels.;The thermophilic UASB achieved stable operation at an OLR of
   11.4 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) (21 h HRT) but an OLR of 13.3 kg COD m(-3) d(-1)
   (18 h HRT) saw a rise in TVFA from 80 to 600 mg l(-1). COD reduction in
   the thermophilic UASB was slightly lower at all OLRs, achieving a 70\%
   COD reduction compared to a 78\% COD reduction in the mesophilic UASB.
   The average TVFA levels were low, but somewhat higher in the
   thermophilic UASB than the mesophilic UASB (100 mg l(-1) compared to 25
   mg l(-1)). It is concluded that either mesophilic or thermophilic
   digestion could be used successfully to treat settled instant coffee
   production wastewater in UASB reactors. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The most widely used treatment of wool scouring effluent (WSE) in
   Australia is lagooning (anaerobic and aerobic). As the pressure to
   devise a more environmentally acceptable treatment method increases
   there is a need to study alternative, efficient biological treatment
   systems for WSE. In this study, laboratory and pilot-scale anaerobic
   biological and chemical flocculation treatment processes were
   investigated for removing the pollutants (mainly wool grease) from WSE.
   Anaerobic biological treatment utilises the natural microbial flora to
   destabilise and bioflocculate the WSE resulting in the settling of wool
   grease from the bulk liquid. Batch trials showed a grease reduction by
   anaerobic bioflocculation of between 30\% (pilot scale) and 50\%
   (laboratory scale) over 8 days. However, the destabilisation of the wool
   grease emulsion after only 2-3 days resulted in a total grease reduction
   of >80\% after addition of a polymeric flocculant. A laboratory
   anaerobic bioflocculation-chemical flocculation process gave promising
   results by removing >90\% grease at hydraulic retention times of 1-2
   days. In the pilot-scale the same process resulted in up to 80\% grease
   removal efficiency. The results of this study indicate that anaerobic
   biological and chemical treatment of WSE is a promising alternative
   treatment system compared to other chemical or natural (lagooning)
   treatment systems. Our approach suggests adding a flocculant to aid the
   separation of biologically coagulated grease from the bulk liquid. A
   final low-level aerobic polishing step will be necessary to meet
   effluent disposal guidelines. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

   that this species possesses four larval instars. The size range of each
   instar for the three parameters was determined by plotting cumulative
   frequency against sample category on probability paper; the inflexion
   curve method. The growth rate between instars was shown to fit Dyar's
   rule for all three parameters. The efficacy of many insecticides depends
   on accurate targeting against the most susceptible stage of the insect
   life cycle. Hence a more detailed knowledge of the instars of S.
