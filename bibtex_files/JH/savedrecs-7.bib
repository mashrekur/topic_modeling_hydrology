Abstract = {{French Guyana is a remote, wild and little instrumented French
   department located in South America. Without rainfall dataset, rivers
   that can be temporally studied from their outlets offer easy accessible
   hydrological and climatologic information on the remote areas that they
   cover. As part of a large project intended to build a biotic index of
   water quality, we studied the hydrological properties of the main French
   Guyana basins. By computing a set of temporal indicators for flow
   variability characterisation, we extracted the most relevant by means of
   a principal component analysis. A cluster analysis based on the
   remaining indicators finally classified the nine watersheds. At this
   stage, French Guyana hydrology shows a surprising uniformity. For this
   reason, standard methods such as the Fourier analysis appear rapidly
   ineffective to analyse the runoff variability. Hence, we exploited the
   potential of continuous wavelet transform on flow curves to detect new
   periodicities or time annual features. The wavelet coefficient maps made
   it possible to detect-and explain the so-called `Short March Summer'.
   meteorological phenomenon. The latter, a temporary reduction of rain
   during the rainy season of the Guyana plateau, has, been explained as
   the result of the Atlantic Ocean influence on the continent. It
   permitted to characterise and discriminate more accurately the studied
   watersheds. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines several. techniques that have the potential to
   improve the quality of slug test analysis. These techniques are
   applicable in the range from low hydraulic conductivities with
   overdamped responses to high hydraulic conductivities with nonlinear
   oscillatory responses. Four techniques for improving slug test analysis
   will be discussed: use of an extended capability nonlinear model,
   sensitivity analysis, correction for acceleration and velocity effects,
   and use of multiple slug tests. The four-parameter nonlinear slug test
   model used in this work is shown to allow accurate analysis of slug
   tests with widely differing character. The parameter beta represents a
   correction to the water column length caused primarily by radius
   variations in the wellbore and is most useful in matching the
   oscillation frequency and amplitude. The water column velocity at slug
   initiation (V-0) is an additional model parameter, which would ideally
   be zero but may not be due to the initiation mechanism. The remaining
   two model parameters are A (parameter for nonlinear effects) and K
   (hydraulic conductivity). Sensitivity analysis shows that in general
   beta and V-0 have the lowest sensitivity and K usually has the highest.
   However, for very high K values the sensitivity to A may surpass the
   sensitivity to K. Oscillatory slug tests involve higher accelerations
   and velocities of the water column; thus, the pressure transducer
   responses are affected by these factors and the model response must be
   corrected to allow maximum accuracy for the analysis. The performance of
   multiple slug tests will allow some statistical measure of the
   experimental accuracy and of the reliability of the resulting aquifer
   parameters. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Delineating capture zones plays an important role in the protection of
   drinking water wells. In the recent literature most of the related work
   has dealt with the uncertainty of location and extent of the capture
   zone due to the heterogeneity of the hydrogeologic parameters of. the
   aquifer. This paper is about the impact of considering transient aquifer
   conditions when computing the capture zone of a well. The presented
   approach alternates for predefined time steps between the groundwater
   flow and a particle tracking module enabling the management of a vast
   number of individual particles. Thus, the development of the capture
   zone can be monitored more precisely and it can be differentiated
   between parts of it. Specific results are presented for an aquifer in
   South-East Austria in terms of the percentage of particles of any
   starting location that are terminated by a well and of the minimum
   travel time a particle needs from the same starting location to reach a
   well. The transient delineated capture zone is compared to those derived
   from steady state computations for specific groundwater flow conditions.
   Though the results are site specific the significance of considering the
   transient system boundary conditions is demonstrated since a
   superposition of the steady state case results clearly overestimates the
   area to be protected. Additionally, in order to address sensitivity and
   computational efficiency the effect of increasing the-release interval
   and the starting pattern of particles on the development of the capture
   zone is analyzed. (C) 2002 Published,by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A new model of infiltration in swelling and shrinking clay soil was
   developed. The model consisted of two flow domains: soil matrix, with
   flow modelled by means of Darcy equation, and macropores; the latter was
   divided in turn into two sub-domains: shrinkage cracks, with aperture
   dynamically depending on matrix water content, and permanent macropores,
   independent of matrix saturation. In the shrinkage cracks sub-domain, a
   kinematic wave equation was derived by considering laminar motion of
   thin water films, along two parallel nearly vertical walls; in the
   permanent macropores sub-domain, a kinematic wave equation was assumed,
   with parameters physically related with macropores shape and dimension.
   Exchange of water between macropore domains and matrix was introduced in
   form of sink terms in the macropores mass balance equations, and as
   source terms in the matrix continuity equation. Infiltration through
   macropore walls was modelled using a diffusivity function derived from
   aggregates sorptivity measurements. The internal catchment was included
   by considering at each layer a fraction of dead end permanent
   macropores. Water ponding at the bottom of dead end macropores,
   infiltrated into the corresponding matrix lay er. The model was tested
   against the results of infiltration transients through a large
   undisturbed swelling and shrinking clay soil column. Outflow rate from
   column bottom surface was constantly measured, while water content
   profile was registered at regular time intervals by means of five TDR
   horizontal probes. In order to quantify model parameters,
   characterisation of soil matrix was carried out, providing hydraulic
   conductivity curve, water retention curve, shrinkage characteristic and
   aggregates diffusivity. All of the other model parameters, thanks to
   their clear physical meaning, were estimated from direct observation of
   soil structure, except macropores morphologic parameters, some of which,
   although measurable, were obtained by calibration due to lack of
   relevant experimental data. The proposed model proved to be able to
   adequately simulate measured breakthrough curves as well as temporal
   evolution of water content profiles along the sample, especially with
   internal catchment process included. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{To facilitate a better understanding of the exchange processes between a
   fractured rock aquifer and a bedrock stream, a study of
   groundwater/surface water interaction between Twenty, Mile Creek and the
   local aquifer in Smithville, Ont. was completed. The points of
   interaction between the creek and the local aquifer were identified and
   quantified through the use of air-photo interpretation, detailed stream
   surveys, electrical conductivity and temperature surveys, isotopic
   analysis, mixing calculations, and point measurements of hydraulic head
   and discharge obtained using mini-piezometers, seepage meters and weirs.
   The results indicate that the interaction between Twenty Mile Creek and
   the local aquifer is extremely limited with greater than 95\% of the
   groundwater within the study area underflowing the creek completely
   during baseflow conditions. In addition, it was observed that
   groundwater discharge in a bedrock stream environment occurs primarily
   through discrete point sources associated with open fractures, as
   compared to more diffuse,,or continuous seepage zones often observed in
   a porous media environment. The small quantity of groundwater
   discharging into Twenty Mile Creek through these features has an
   electrical conductivity and isotopic signature consistent with shallow
   groundwater and most likely originates in the upper 3-7 in of bedrock.
   Although previous investigations have identified potentially open
   vertical fractures within the study area, it is apparent that the
   fracture network has extremely poor vertical connections, limiting
   groundwater exchange in the vicinity of the creek. In addition, the low
   velocity and discharge rate within the creek does not allow for incising
   into the bedrock. As a result, horizontal fractures do not play a
   significant role in the exchange process within the study area. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Mapping soil water content (SWC) is a difficult but important task in
   many fields, such as hydrology, agronomy and soil science.
   Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a valuable technique to measure
   surface SWC at an intermediate scale in between the scales of time
   domain reflectometry (TDR) and remotely sensed data. To measure SWC with
   GPR, the surface soil permittivity was determined with the ground wave
   velocity. The first aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of
   GPR to measure spatial SWC variation. The second aim was to compare GPR
   and TDR with respect to the type of spatial SWC structures that can be
   measured by these methods. A spatial structure in SWC was created by
   heterogeneous irrigation with sprinklers of various intensities. Then
   spatial SWC variation was measured with both GPR and TDR. The experiment
   showed that GPR is well able to measure spatial SWC variation as
   expressed by the variogram. The larger measurement volume of GPR
   filtered out small-scale spatial variation (< 1.5 m) and the large
   number of easily acquired GPR measurements resulted in well-defined and
   smooth experimental variograms. A comparison of interpolated SWC maps
   before and after irrigation showed that GPR is better suited than TDR
   for mapping large-scale features (> 5 m) in SWC. Especially the
   boundaries between areas with different SWC were better resolved in case
   of GPR because of the large number of GPR measurements obtained with the
   same measurement effort. Small-scale features (< 5 m) were not mapped
   adequately by either GPR or TDR. However, the chance of detecting
   small-scale features in SWC mapping at the field scale is higher for
   GPR, simply because of the higher sampling density. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Glacial bulk meltwaters and active-layer groundwaters were sampled from
   the proglacial zone of Finsterwalderbreen during a single melt season in
   1999, in order to determine the geochemical processes that maintain high
   chemical weathering rates in the proglacial zone of this glacier.
   Results demonstrate that the principle means of solute acquisition is
   the weathering of highly reactive moraine and fluvial active-layer
   sediments by supra-permafrost groundwaters. Active-layer groundwater
   derives from the thaw of the proglacial snowpack, buried ice and glacial
   bulk meltwaters. Groundwater evolves by sulphide oxidation and carbonate
   dissolution. Evaporation- and freeze-concentration of groundwater in
   summer and winter, respectively produce Mg-Ca-sulphate salts on the
   proglacial surface. Re-dissolution of these salts in early summer
   produces groundwaters that are supersaturated with respect to calcite.
   There is a pronounced spatial pattern to the geochemical evolution of
   groundwater. Close to the main proglacial channel, active layer
   sediments are flushed diurnally by bulk meltwaters. Here, Mg-Ca-sulphate
   deposits become exhausted in the early season and geochemical evolution
   proceeds by a combination of sulphide oxidation and carbonate
   dissolution. At greater distances from the channel, the dissolution of
   Mg-Ca-sulphate salts is a major influence and dilution by the bulk
   meltwaters is relatively minor. The influence of sulphate salt
   dissolution decreases during the sampling season, as these salts are
   exhausted and waters become increasingly routed by subsurface flowpaths.

Abstract = {{In an earlier study, Puente and Obregon {[}Water Resour. Res.
   32(1996)2825] reported on the usage of a deterministic
   fractal-multifractal (FM) methodology to faithfully describe an 8.3 It
   high-resolution rainfall time series in Boston, gathered every 15 s and
   made of 1990 points, as the derived distribution of a classical
   multifractal measure via a fractal interpolating function. This work
   further studies the robustness of the FM methodology via an exhaustive
   sensitivity analysis aimed at obtaining even better FM descriptions for
   the Boston storm. This is carried out by varying a host of pertinent
   attributes that include usage of: (a) alternative objective functions
   for the inverse problem based on cumulative distributions of the records
   and of their derivatives; (b) a genetic algorithm in order to find the
   best FM parameters; (c) fractal interpolating functions passing by 3, 4
   and 5 points, considering all relevant parameter-combination cases
   separately; and (d) two scales of aggregation, i.e. records with 199 and
   1990 bins. The analysis indicates that previous results may indeed be
   improved when cumulative distributions of the records, rather than the
   records themselves,are employed in the FM parameter search, especially
   for representations based on 4 and 5 interpolating points and at the
   highest data resolution. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Geomorphic impacts of a July 2001 flood in the Hungry Mother basin near
   Marion, Virginia, were examined to shed light on the relationships
   between channel characteristics and the frequency of channel-modifying
   discharges. Creeks in the study area have been observed for many years,
   with no significant channel changes since at least 1985. The 2001 flood
   had a recurrence interval of > 200 years, and caused the only channel
   change, bank erosion, and transport of coarse channel material observed
   in recent decades. The paucity of fines in channels before or after the
   flood, and the absence of sub-sand sized material in the flood deposits,
   indicates that normal, frequent, well-below-bankfull flows are
   sufficient to transport the (apparently limited) supply of fines. The
   large particles transported during the 2001 flood after years of
   inactivity indicate that relatively rare floods are necessary to
   mobilize this material. This suggests the notion of a bimodal `dominant'
   discharge. On the one hand frequent flows considerably below bankfull
   levels are sufficient to maintain the channel and prevent significant
   accumulation of fine sediments and organic matter. On the other hand,
   rare floods are necessary to transport the coarser bed material and
   erode channel banks. In the Hungry Mother area, bed material has no
   relationship to normal flows, or to flows with recurrence intervals on
   the order of 1-3 years. Bankfull discharge is apparently not related to
   either the maintenance or channel-changing dominant discharges. These
   results suggest that the use of channel dimensions and/or bed material
   as surrogate indicators of hydrologic regimes can be quite complicated,
   and that in some streams bankfull flow has no particular significance in
   terms of sediment transport and channel modifications. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Data are presented of experiments with turbulent open channel flow over
   rough surfaces and large relative submergence, which are conducted in
   two series with different geometric boundary conditions. During the
   experiments an oscillating fluid motion in the uppermost filter layer is
   visualised by the injection of a tracer dye. It is shown that this
   oscillating fluid motion is driven by highly unsteady pressure gradients
   and contributes to in- and outflow at the interface between surface and
   subsurface flow, but its intensity decays rapidly with increasing filter
   depth. About 90\% of the high frequency pressure fluctuations measured
   at the surface of the filter layer are damped at a filter depth of about
   4-5 times the average gravel size of the surface of the bed.
   It is assumed that the considered high frequency oscillations originate
   from turbulent pressure fluctuations in the near bed layer. The
   exponential function that fits the decay of turbulent pressure
   fluctuations implies a length scale of about 12 times the geometric
   roughness height as dominant wavelength of a turbulent structure, which
   imposes a pressure fluctuation on a riverbed. The presented results
   reveal that micro scale advective transport between surface and
   subsurface flow occurs separate from diffusive effects and should be
   considered for the transfer of solutes like dissolved oxygen from fresh
   to subsurface water and its respiration in the uppermost sediment of
   aquatic beds. (C) 2002 Elsevier, Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Existing flow resistance relationships for mountain rivers maybe in
   error by typically 30\%. In part this is because flow resistance is a
   complex phenomenon, not easy to quantify with the available data.
   However, a further reason is the reliance of past analyses on fitting
   relationships to data from multiple sites, hence emphasizing an
   averaging between-site variation. A more scientific approach is to
   derive separate at-a-site relationships and investigate how they can be
   collapsed into a single formula. Twenty-seven carefully selected field
   datasets from seven literature sources are therefore analysed
   empirically to show at-a-site variations in resistance, with the aim of
   improving the accuracy and applicability of mountain river flow
   resistance relationships. Considering only the bed grain roughness, the
   principal factors likely to determine flow resistance are identified as
   relative submergence d/D-84 (where d is depth and D-84 is the bed
   material 84-percentile size), bed material size, distribution and
   channel slope. The dependency of the resistance function (8/f)(1/2)
   (where f is the Darcy-Weisbach resistance coefficient) on d/D84 is more
   accurately described by a power law than by a semi-logarithmic law,
   especially at high flows. From observations of coincident at-a-site
   datasets, two equations are derived, distinguished largely according to
   channel slope S. For S < 0.8\%, (8/f)(1/2) = 3.84(d/D-84)(0.547) (r(2) =
   0.986). For S > 0.8\% (8/f)(1/2) = 3.10(d/D-84)(0.93) (r(2) = 0.959).
   These equations appear to define minimum values for flow resistance,
   probably for ideal conditions of bed grain roughness and uniform flow.
   Deviations from this ideal (because of form roughness, nonuniform flow
   or bank effects) will increase resistance in a manner which is not yet
   quantified. The equations therefore have a very specific applicability
   and are not generally applicable to all flows. The cause of the slope
   dependency remains unclear, nor is any dependency on bed material size
   distribution identified. Nevertheless the high correlation coefficients
   suggest an improved accuracy compared with other field-based
   relationships. The equations are derived for in-bank flows with d/D-84 <
   11 and slopes in the range 0.2-4\%. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The main research objective consisted in analysing the influence of
   roughness caused by aquatic vegetation (av), in particular submerged
   macrophytes, on the overall flow field. These plants are highly flexible
   and behave differently depending on the flow situation. They also react
   substantially to the flow field and thus, the roughness becomes variable
   and dynamic. Conventional flow formulas, such as the Manning or the
   Strickler formula, are one-dimensional and based on integral flow
   parameters. They are not suitable for quantifying the roughness of av,
   because the flow is complex and more dimensional due to the variable
   behaviour of the plants. Therefore, the present investigation
   concentrates on the definition of a characteristic hydraulic roughness
   parameter, to quantify the resistance of av. Within this investigation
   laboratory experiments were carried out with three different types of
   av, chosen with respect to varying plant structures as well as stem
   lengths. Velocity measurements above these plants were conducted to
   determine the relationship between the hydraulic roughness and the
   deflected plant height. The deflected plant height is used as the
   geometric roughness parameter, whereas the equivalent sand roughness
   based on the universal logarithmic law modified by Nikuradse was used as
   hydraulic roughness parameter. The influence of relative submergence on
   the hydraulic roughness was also analysed. The analysis of the velocity
   measurements illustrates that equivalent sand roughness and zero plane
   displacement of the logarithmic law are correlated to the deflected
   plant height and are equally to this height. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Flow resistance of natural grasses, sedges and willows was studied in a
   laboratory flume. The objective was to investigate, how type, density
   and placement of vegetation, flow depth and velocity influence friction
   losses. The plants were studied in various combinations under
   nonsubmerged and submerged conditions in a total of 350 test runs. The
   results show large variations in the friction factor, f with depth of
   flow, velocity, Reynolds number, and vegetative density. The friction
   factor was dependent mostly on (1) the relative roughness in the case of
   grasses; (2) the flow velocity in the case of willows and sedges/grasses
   combined; and (3) the flow depth in the case of leafless willows on bare
   bottom soil. Leaves on willows seemed to double or even triple the
   friction factor compared to the leafless case despite the fact that the
   bottom was growing sedges in both cases. For the leafless willows, f
   appeared to increase with depth almost linearly and independently of
   velocity. Unexpectedly, different spacing of the same number of leafless
   willows with grasses did not have any significant effect on f Based on
   the experimental work, a better understanding of flow resistance due to
   different combinations of natural stiff and flexible vegetation under
   nonsubmerged and submerged conditions was gained. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The paper faces the problem of the resistance due to vegetation in a
   river characterized by fully submerged vegetation formed by concentrated
   colonies of bushes. The flow presents strong spatial variations between
   plants that make unreliable the traditional approach based on time
   averaging of turbulent fluctuations. A more useful model, based on time
   and spatial averaging is proposed. In the paper the necessary closure
   hypotheses are also discussed. The vertical distribution of mean
   velocity and turbulence stress have been measured with laser Doppler
   anemometry techniques, by means of spatial and time-averaging rules.
   Based on the double-averaged velocity and Reynolds stress profiles, an
   analytical two-layer model is proposed, in order to describe uniform
   flow conditions in the whole flow depth. Theoretical results are
   compared with the results of a series of experimental tests carried out
   in a laboratory flume. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A new simplified approach is developed for the channel flow dynamics
   under woody debris transport. A continuous carpet of debris is
   considered, covering a uniform stationary current. Due to the floating
   debris the shear stresses in the fluid domain are affected. As a result,
   the velocity profile is different from the free surface flow. The simple
   model proposed here is able to capture the essential features of flow
   response to woody debris transport. Velocity and stress profiles are
   analytically derived for laminar flow and compared with the zero debris
   condition. More realistic turbulent currents are simulated with the
   Reynolds equations where turbulent stresses are modeled by the simple
   mixing length concept. Validation is carried out by comparison with
   experimental velocity profiles and with direct numerical simulation of
   the Navier Stokes Equations. Synthetic diagrams are proposed for the
   calculation of the flow velocity and the bed shear stresses in terms of
   the relevant non-dimensional parameters. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{A 1D steady-state flow simulation model was developed. A module
   evaluating the roughness parameters due to the surface roughness of the
   main channel and floodplains, riparian forests on the floodplains, and
   the momentum exchange between the main channel and floodplains was
   introduced into the model. In the module, the roughness parameters were
   evaluated by the formulas proposed by the DVWK {[}Hydraulische Methoden
   zur Erfassung von Rauheiten (1990); Hydraulische Berechnung von
   Fhessgewassem (1991)] for steady and uniform flow conditions. The model
   was calibrated with data obtained from three flood events. Roughness
   parameters of the main channel and floodplains of both sides were
   identified in the situation before May 1999. The morphological situation
   changed slightly. Several sensitivity analyses were carried out for the
   following cases: (a) the morphological situation before May 1999 with
   the original parameters, (b) the situation of (a) with various
   parameters to the realistic extent, (c) the situation being so that the
   floodplain on the German side were imaginarily enlarged up to utmost 90
   m with the original vegetation, and (d) the situation,of (c) with
   various parameters to the realistic extent. Many combinations of the
   roughness parameters due to the bed roughness and density of the
   vegetation were examined. The results showed that the most significant
   parameter is the bed roughness of the floodplains, and the next is that
   of the main channel. A modification of parameters of the riparian
   vegetation is of minor importance. The model was extended to a ID
   unsteady state flow simulation model and applied to two flood data
   obtained in the reach between Rheinweiler (186.156 km from Lake
   Constance) and Hartheim (214.244 km) in Germany in 1998 and 1999. Both
   measured and calculated hydrographs at Hartheim had their peak discharge
   at the same time, and the discrepancy of the discharge between the
   measured and calculated hydrographs was less than 10\%. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{In areas that are occasionally inundated by floods, it is essential to
   know the quantity and density of vegetation that can be allowed while
   avoiding flooding beyond the intended floodplains. An unsteady flow
   model was developed for a channel with vegetated floodplains, to take
   into account the retention effects of the vegetated areas on flood wave
   conveyance. A one-dimensional (1D) unsteady flow model was combined with
   Nuding's method, which takes into account the friction caused by
   vegetation and the additional resistance caused by the interaction
   between the main channel and vegetated areas. Nuding's method was used
   to compute the total Darcy-Weisbach friction factor for each cross
   section and each water level as input data for each time step of the
   flow model. The model was applied to a double-trapezoidal channel, and
   the results were compared with a traditional model, in which floodplains
   were considered only as storage. Differences in the conveyance capacity
   of the channel were found between the models. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Climatic change has great implications for hydrological cycle and water
   resources planning. In order to assess this impact. a macro-scale and
   semi-distributed monthly water balance model was proposed and developed
   to simulate and predict the hydrological processes. GIS techniques were
   used as a tool to analyze topography, river networks, land-use. human
   activities, vegetation and soil characteristics. The model parameters
   were linked to these basin characteristics by regression and
   optimization methods. A parameterization scheme was developed and the
   model parameters were estimated for each grid element. Based on the
   different GCM and RCM outputs, the sensitivities of hydrology and water
   resources for China to global warming were studied. The proposed models
   are capable of producing both the magnitude and timing of runoff and
   water resources conditions. The semi-dry regions, such as Liaohe, Haihe,
   Ruanhe and Huaihe River basins in north China, The runoffs of these
   basins are small or even zero during dry season (from Oct. to May) and
   are very sensitive to temperature increase and rainfall decrease. While
   in the basins of the humid south China like Yangtze River basin, the
   runoffs are perennial and the base flow normally occupies a large
   portion of the total runoff volume. These humid basins are less
   vulnerable to climate chance. Results of the study also indicated that
   runoff is more sensitive to variation in precipitation than to increase
   in temperature, Climate change challenges existing water resources
   management practices by additional uncertainty. Integrated water
   resources management will enhance the potential for adaptation to
   change. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this analytic-numerical Bayesian forecasting system (BFS)
   is to produce a short-term probabilistic river stage forecast based on a
   probabilistic quantitative precipitation forecast as an input and a
   deterministic hydrologic model (of any complexity) as a means of
   simulating the response of a headwater basin to precipitation. The BFS
   has three structural components: the precipitation uncertainty
   processor, the hydrologic uncertainty processor, and the integrator. A
   series of articles described the Bayesian forecasting theory and
   detailed each component of this particular BFS. This article presents a
   synthesis: the total system, operational expressions, estimation
   procedures, numerical algorithms, a complete example, and all design
   requirements, modeling assumptions, and operational attributes. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The probabilistic river stage forecast (PRSF) specifies a sequence of
   exceedance functions \{psi(n) : n = 1...., N\} such that psi(n)(h(n)) =
   P(H-n > h(n)), where H-n is the river stage at time instance t(n) and P
   stands for probability. The probabilistic flood forecast (PFF) should
   specify a sequence of exceedance functions ((F) over bar (n) : n = 1....
   N) such that (F) over bar (n)(h) = P(Z(n) > h), where Z(n) is the
   maximum river stage within time interval (t(0), t(n)] practically Z(n) =
   max\{H-1,...,H-n\}. In the absence of information about the stochastic
   dependence structure of the process \{H-1,.....H-N\}, the PFF cannot be
   derived from the PRSF. This article presents simple methods for
   calculating bounds on F, and approximations to P, using solely the
   marginal exceedance functions (\&psi;) over bar (1),....,(\&psi;) over
   bar (n). The methods are illustrated with tutorial examples and a case
   study for a 1430 km(2) headwater basin wherein the PRSF is for a 72-h
   interval discretized into 6-h steps. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{A model for the prediction of both topographic and climatic control on
   shallow landslide initiation processes in hilly mountainous terrain is
   proposed. The model develops upon a theory for coupled shallow
   subsurface flow and landsliding of the soil mantle previously proposed
   by Montgomery and Dietrich {[}Water Resour. Res, 30 (1994) 1153], The
   model uses a `quasi-dynamic' wetness index to predict the spatial
   distribution of soil saturation in response to a rainfall of specified
   duration. The rainfall predicted to cause instability in each
   topographic element is characterised by duration and frequency of
   occurrence. The incorporation of a rainfall frequency-duration
   relationship into assessment of landslide hazard provides a practical
   way to include climate information into estimation of the relative
   potential for shallow landsliding. The model is applied to a mountain
   experimental basin where high-resolution digital elevation data are
   available: the Cordon catchment (5 km(2)), in north-eastern Italy. An
   inventory of landslide scars is used to document sites of instability
   and to provide a test of model performance by comparing observed
   landslide locations with model predictions. The model reasonably
   reproduces the observed distribution of landslides, although spatial
   variability of soil properties and hydrologic complexities not accounted
   for by the model complicate prediction of where landslides occur within
   areas of similar topographic-climatic control. Model predictions from
   the quasi-dynamic model are compared with those provided by the
   steady-state model {[}Water Resour, Res. 30 (1994) 1153], These results
   suggest that the quasi-dynamic model offers significant improvement over
   the steady-state model in predicting existing landslides as represented
   in the considered landslide inventory. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{An automatic calibration methodology for the Xinanjiang model that has
   been successfully and widely applied in China is presented. The
   automatic calibration of the model consists of two parts: water balance
   parameter and runoff routing parameter calibration. The former is based
   on a simple genetic algorithm (GA), The latter is based on a new method
   which combines a fuzzy optimal model (FOM) with a GA for solving the
   multiple objective runoff routing parameters calibration problem, Except
   for the specific fitness where the membership degree of alternative
   obtained by FOM with limited alternatives and multiobjectives is
   employed. the GA with multiple objectives in this paper is otherwise the
   same as the simple GA. The parameter calibration includes optimization
   of multiple objectives: (1) peak discharge. (2) peak time and (3) total
   runoff volume. Thirty-four historical floods from 12 years in the
   Shuangpai Reservoir are applied to calibrate the model parameters whilst
   I I floods in recent 2 years are utilized to verify these parameters.
   Results of this study and application show that the hybrid methodology
   of GAs and the FOM is not only capable of exploiting more the important
   characteristics of floods but also efficient and robust. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{1D and 2D models of flood hydraulics (HEC-RAS, LISFLOOD-FP and
   TELEMAC-2D) are tested on a 60 km reach of the river Severn, UK.
   Synoptic views of flood extent from radar remote sensing satellites have
   been acquired for flood events in 1998 and 2000. The three models are
   calibrated, using floodplain and channel friction as free parameters.
   against both the observed inundated area and records of downstream
   discharge. The predictive power of the models calibrated against
   inundation extent or discharge for one event can thus be measured using
   independent validation data for the second. The results show that for
   this reach both the HEC-RAS and TELEMAC-2D models can be calibrated
   against discharge or inundated area data and give good predictions of
   inundated a-rea. whereas the LISFLOOD-FP needs to be calibrated against
   independent inundated area data to produce acceptable results. The
   different predictive performances of the models stem from their
   different responses to changes in friction parameterisation. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The existence of an ice cover has important effects on the streamflow
   conditions as well as on the hear transfer between water bodies and the
   overlying atmosphere, This paper investigates the effects of climate
   variability on the termination of the ice season in the Baltic region.
   In particular, trends and fluctuations observed in the cryophenological
   records from this region are analyzed in detail, searching for possible
   connections with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The NAO seems to
   affect mostly the late-winter temperature (January-March) with a
   significant impact also on the mid-spring (April-May) period, when the
   air temperature is strongly correlated to the ice dates. A regional
   analysis shows the existence in the series of winter temperature (JFM)
   of the same fluctuations as the winter NAO. The same components can be
   found in the cryophenological records and (partly) in the series of
   spring temperature. Nevertheless, both ice phenology and spring
   temperature show the existence of a very well defined trend that is not
   detectable in the series of winter NAO at time scales of a century or
   longer, This leads to the conclusion that winter NAO has still a weak,
   though significant, effect on the regime of spring temperature in the
   Baltic region and explains the most significant fluctuating components
   embedded in the cryophenological records. However it is argued that
   other climatic forcings, related to CO2-induced regional and global
   warming, acting at the end of the ice season, are able to induce
   pronounced trends in the regime of spring temperature and have an
   important impact on the cryosphere leading to the earlier occurrence of
   ice break-up observed in the last several decades. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The k-day extreme precipitation depths (k = 1, 2. 3, 4. 5, 7, 10, 15,
   20, 25 and 30) at the climatological network of Belgium (165 stations)
   are analysed to assess the regional general extreme value (GEV) growth
   curves and to determine the at-site fractiles. The calendar year and the
   hydrological summer and winter are considered separately. The method
   proposed combines regional L-moment estimates of the GEV parameters and
   tends to take advantage of a few long-term well-documented series.
   Therefore, a data extension procedure based on the fractiles method has
   been used to extend the 1951-1995 observation period to the 1910-1995
   reference period. This ensures the temporal homogeneity of the series by
   assessing the possible missing extremes and it places all the series in
   a reference period. where the stationarity of the extreme precipitation
   has been verified. Using the nine historical series and generating
   randomly located missing values the efficiency of three data extension
   methods has been evaluated. This comparison indicates that a procedure
   using the regional growth curve satisfies this task. It shows that the
   residual mean square error of the at-site means is reduced when the mean
   correlation between the reference station and the series presenting gaps
   exceeds 0.52 but that the corresponding error on high order fractiles is
   reduced for all the observed correlation and for large numbers (40-50)
   of missing values. A practical estimation of the confidence intervals is
   proposed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade. concern about the morphological and ecological
   condition of the rivers Rhine and Meuse has increased. Simultaneously
   with the projects for rehabilitation. measures were proposed to improve
   the discharge capacity of the high-water floodway, in order to reduce
   the risk of river flooding. Although many studies focus on the impact of
   different landscaping measures on the river hydrodynamics (water level
   and discharge capacity), little attention is paid to the sustainability
   of the proposed measures with respect to sedimentation. In this study a
   one-dimensional (1D) floodplain sedimentation model was developed that
   estimates average sediment accumulation over floodplain sections and
   that can be used for estimation of changes in floodplain sedimentation
   caused by landscaping measures. The model was successfully calibrated
   and validated using sedimentation measurements carried out at different
   floodplain sections along the river Rhine in The Netherlands during
   floods. Application of the model to the main branches of the river Rhine
   in The Netherlands indicates that the average annual sediment
   accumulation equals 1,72 kg/m(2)/yr, or 394 million kg/yr. This is about
   13\% of the total annual suspended sediment load transported into The
   Netherlands at Lobith. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Title = {{A comparison of published experimental data with a coupled lattice

Abstract = {{Many processes in the Earth's crust are controlled by the chemical and
   physical interactions between fluids and geological media where the
   lattice is usually characterised by a heterogeneous permeability,
   intrinsic rock permeability and fault networks.
   Dissolution/precipitation of rock minerals and chemical transport can
   alter the rock properties. which leads to a change in the flow
   characteristics and alteration of the geological media with time. In
   this article, we propose a novel method for modelling heterogeneous
   reactive transport with a feedback between the flow and chemical
   alterations. To model fluid flow, we use a modified lattice Boltzmann
   scheme which facilitates the incorporation of complex boundary
   conditions and enables us to examine flow in heterogeneous media. In
   addition, the local update rules of this scheme allow the code to be
   parallelised on multiple processors. We have coupled transport of
   chemical species and reactive flow to this scheme using a solution to
   the advection-diffusion equation. Experimentally derived
   dissolution/precipitation rates are used to calculate rates of
   interaction between minerals and the fluids with which they are in
   contact. Laboratory scale passive and reactive flow-cell experiments
   from the literature have been used to test and validate the accuracy of
   the transport of the chemical species in a heterogeneous porous medium.
   We have also examined the output of our scheme for water-rock
   interactions in a quartzofeldspathic lithology for relatively long
   periods of geological time. We have focused on quartz and feldspar
   reactive flow with associated secondary clay minerals, as these are some
   of the most abundant minerals in the Earth's crust. In all cases, the
   numerical results agree well with the experimental results from our
   numerical scheme. The scheme also reproduces alteration of a
   quartzofeldspathic lithology over geological time periods, consistent
   with other numerical work. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A process-based distributed model of snowmelt processes was developed to
   simulate snowpack depletion during the melt season in a small headwater
   catchment in the Spanish Pyrenees. The grid scale model was calibrated
   and evaluated using meteorological and snowpack data from the catchment.
   The model was then run in distributed mode to examine the relative
   importance of spatial patterns of snow accumulation and melt on snowpack
   depletion. Model results demonstrated that the spatial distribution of
   snow water equivalent (SWE) at the start of the melt season is the
   primary control on patterns of snow disappearance within the catchment,
   and that representation of spatial variability in melt rates is of minor
   importance. Accurate simulation of the rate of snow cover depletion
   during the melt season was shown to be important for accurate simulation
   of melt runoff rates at the catchment scale, because of the importance
   of snow covered area in determining the catchment average melt rate.
   The practical implication of these results is that micro-scale spatial
   variability in SWE (i.e. of the order of 10-100 m) needs to be taken
   into account for accurate simulation of snowmelt runoff at
   larger-scales. However, it appears that variability in energy inputs at
   these scales can be neglected without significant loss of accuracy. It
   is suggested that a frequency distribution approach could be adopted to
   parameterise SWE variability into grid or catchment scale models. (C)

Abstract = {{Haktanir originally introduced the method of self-determined probability
   weighted moments as an extension of the traditional method of
   probability weighted moments for parameter estimation. While this method
   possesses many advantages, his algorithms introduced certain
   mathematical manipulations for numerical convenience or based upon
   special knowledge of the behavior of a data sample. Also, some of these
   algorithms relied upon inputs from numerical tables that are not widely
   accessible. To improve the usefulness of this method, new algorithms
   have been developed that directly implement the relevant equations and
   do not rely upon external results. In this paper, we show that these
   features extend the applicability of self-determined probability
   weighted moments without loss of accuracy in the parameter estimates.
   Examples from flood peak analysis and extreme wind speed estimation are
   presented. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   fluorescence, whereas groundwater from the transient saturated zone
   showed fluorescence patterns characteristic of fulvic acid. Throughfall
   showed fluorescence of a non-fulvic character, Stormflow water showed
   fulvic-type fluorescence, showing that groundwater from the transient
   saturated zone contributed 62.7\% of the total discharge, The source
   area for transient saturated zone groundwater accounted for less than
   1\% of the catchment area during the storm event. The contribution of
   the riparian zone to the storm runoff was important, although its source

Abstract = {{In this paper we report on vertical variations in the values of the
   effective diffusion coefficient determined on 19 chalk samples collected
   throughout most of the Eocene section (285 m) in the northern Negev
   desert, Israel. The dependence of the measured values on sample depth.
   porosity, permeability and mineralogy was also evaluated, Finally, a
   correlation between the measured effective diffusion coefficient and
   porosity is suggested for these samples.
   The calculated values of the diffusion coefficient ranged from 1.22 to
   2.55 X 10(-6) cm(2)/s. These values are significantly higher than those
   measured on consolidated rock samples, and similar to values reported
   for British Cretaceous chalk. Our results demonstrate that the effective
   diffusion coefficient values for the Eocene chalk in the northern Negev
   desert, Israel are exclusively dependent on the porosity of the chalk
   matrix by D-e = D(0)epsilon(2) (m = 2 in Archie's law) and not on its
   mineralogy or permeability. The fitted exponent, in, falls between the
   two extreme values of 1.5 and 2.5 that were mentioned by {[}Diffusion in
   Natural Porous Media (1998)] for porous media. However, a linear
   relationship between the effective diffusion coefficient and porosity
   fits better the data within the range of the measured of porosities,
   These correlations provide an easier and less costly method of
   estimating the diffusion coefficient in chalk samples from the Eocene
   Group in the nor-them Negev desert, Israel. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{An objective common to many watershed studies is to separate storm
   hydrographs into two components: water that was present in the watershed
   prior to a storm event (soil moisture and groundwater) and water which
   fell on the watershed during the storm. To use this approach, a number
   of assumptions must be made including that the composition of water in
   the soil moisture and groundwater reservoirs are constant and known. The
   objective of this paper is to show that in settings where flow and
   transport are dominated by preferential pathways for flow. steady state
   mass balance calculations for quantitative hydrograph separation may be
   in error. We present field data from a site where flow and transport are
   dominated by preferential pathways (relict fractures in saprolite of
   sedimentary rocks) which indicate that the delta(18)O content of the
   water in the unsaturated and shallow saturated zones is not constant
   over the course of a storm event. We use a numerical model to further
   explore the interactions between the fractures and surrounding matrix.
   Both the field data and modeling results indicate that the delta(18)O of
   the previous storm event(s) has a strong influence on water in the
   fractures. On the time scale of a storm event. only the water in the
   matrix immediately surrounding the fracture mixes with water in the
   fracture. while the bulk of the matrix is isolated from fracture flow.
   The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the delta(18)O in the
   subsurface and the isolation of the most of the matrix water from flow
   in fractures make the measurement of a singular delta(18)O value for
   subsurface reservoirs problematic and the assumption of a constant value
   doubtful. Since most near-surface geologic materials have preferential
   How paths. we suggest that quantitative hydrograph separation using mass
   balance techniques is not possible in most situations. Future field and
   modeling investigations using the approach outlined here could be
   designed to explore the important temporal and spatial scales of
   variability in watersheds, and lead to a more quantitative approach to
   storm hydrograph separation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analytical solution to describe tidal groundwater
   level fluctuations in a coastal leaky aquifer system bounded by
   water-land boundaries that form a right angle (referred to as L-shaped
   coastlines). The system consists of an unconfined aquifer, a confined

   solutions that discuss only single aquifer constitute a special case of
   the new solution when the permeability of leaky layer approaches zero. A
   simple approximate solution without integral is presented. Error
   analysis and hypothetical example show that the approximate solution has

Abstract = {{Although the impact of plantation forestry and ground-preparation
   drainage on headwater runoff response has been widely studied, there are
   remaining uncertainties concerning the time scale of changes. scale
   effects of catchment size and impacts on flow variability. Flow
   variability, along with changes in sediment loads and water quality. is
   likely to be a defining element of the overall instream habitat quality
   of headwater catchments. In this paper a method is described for the
   characterisation of flow variability using 15-min data on the 1.5 km(2)
   Coalburn catchment, from 1967 to 1998. over a period of change from
   natural moorland to closed canopy coniferous forest. The method is based
   on annual number. and average and total duration of pulses above
   selected threshold flows but decouples the effects of variable annual
   rainfall. The number of pulses increased from pre- to post-drainage but
   pulse number has declined steadily and pulse duration increased with
   forest growth-the catchment has become more, then less `flashy'. The
   method provides a comprehensive. continuous and quantitative picture of
   changes in hydrological regime that is relevant to current assessments
   of instream physical habitat and `environmentally acceptable flows'.
   It is possible that low invertebrate numbers and low levels of fish
   recruitment in the Coalburn channel may be in part attributable to
   changes in flow regime. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Part (I) of this study presented field and laboratory experimental data
   on soil characteristics and hydraulic parameters that are related to
   water infiltration in rice paddy fields. Part (II) includes a series of
   numerical simulations that are based on the in situ data, which
   three-dimensional finite element computer model for simulating density
   dependent flow and transport (FEMWATER) produced to identify and
   evaluate the controlling factors in the vertical percolation/lateral
   seepage processes. As well, ground water recharge that resulted from the
   fields' infiltration is estimated. FEMWATER was first compared with
   one-dimensional simulation algorithm for water flow in aquatic habitats.
   as well as experimental data that were in good agreement. Simulation
   results indicated that the plow sole was the major factor that controls
   infiltration rate. Notably, infiltration is primarily a vertical
   downward flow within flooded areas, Significant lateral movement
   occurred only at wet to dry boundaries. The length of the wet to dry
   boundary, the area of the flooded paddy rice fields, and the difference
   in initial water content between flooded and dry field soils determined
   the ratio of lateral seepage to vertical infiltration. If surrounded by
   dry land, simulated effective ground water recharge was estimated at
   50-76\% of the total infiltration within a typical 48 ha rice paddy.
   However, this was reduced to 39-71\% within a 12 ha rice growing area.
   Breaking the hard pan enhances the infiltration rate but also increases
   the seepage ratio. Thus, it was concluded that a flooded rice paddy
   performs a significant function in ground water conservation.
   Experimental and simulation results elucidate water movement mechanisms
   in rice paddies and clarify the vertical and horizontal flow processes
   within an unsaturated region. This work also provides a scientific basis
   to reevaluate water resource management in regions under irrigated rice.

Abstract = {{We assess the usefulness of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) in
   imaging and characterising subsurface solute transport in heterogeneous
   unconfined aquifers. A field tracer experiment was conducted at the
   Krauthausen test site, Germany. The spatial and temporal evolution of
   the injected NaBr solute plume was monitored in a 2D ERT image plane
   located downstream of the injection well for 90 days. Since ERT maps
   changes in bulk electrical conductivity, the reconstructed images at
   selected time intervals are first converted to solute concentration maps
   by postulating a linear relation. The concentration maps are then
   analysed using an equivalent convection-dispersion model (CDM), which
   conceptualises the aquifer as a homogeneous medium with a uniform mean
   flow velocity. As demonstrated by associated synthetic model studies,
   ERT resolution in terms of recovered equivalent dispersivities is
   limited due to spatial smoothing inherent to the imaging algorithm.
   Since for heterogeneous media, local concentrations within the plume
   deviate from those predicted by the equivalent CDM, we also interpret
   the ERT-derived pixel breakthrough curves in terms of an equivalent
   stream-tube model (STM). The STM represents transport in the aquifer by
   a set of 1D convection-dispersion processes, allowing the degree of
   mixing and the heterogeneity of transport within the plume to be
   quantified. We believe that the observed tracer plume is satisfactorily
   described by the equivalent CDM, probably because the tracer plume was
   small relative to the heterogeneity scale of the aquifer. Even though
   application of the STM revealed some deviation from the ideal
   homogeneous case, the equivalent dispersivity in the STM matches the
   longitudinal dispersivity of the CDM closely, consistent with
   predominantly homogeneous mixing. However, the STM analysis illustrates
   how ERT results can be used to quantify the variability of parameters
   relevant to flow and transport in heterogeneous aquifers. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Cross-borehole geoelectrical imaging, in particular electrical
   resistivity tomography (ERT) and transmission radar tomography, can
   provide high-resolution images of hydrogeological structures and, in
   some cases, detailed assessment of dynamic processes in the subsurface
   environment. Through appropriate petrophysical relationships, these
   tools offer data suitable for parameterising and constraining models of
   groundwater flow. This is demonstrated using cross-borehole radar and
   resistivity measurements collected during a controlled vadose zone
   tracer test, performed at a field site in the UK Sherwood Sandstone.
   Both methods show clearly the vertical migration of the tracer over a
   200 h monitoring period. By comparing first and second spatial moments
   of changes in moisture content predicted from a numerical simulation of
   vadose zone flow with equivalent statistics from two- and
   three-dimensional ERT and cross-borehole radar profiles the effective
   hydraulic conductivity is estimated to be approximately 0.4 m/d. Such a
   value is comparable to field estimates from borehole hydraulic tests
   carried out in the saturated zone at the field site and provides
   valuable information that may be utilised to parameterise pollutant
   transport models of the site. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Understanding the processes controlling recharge to aquifers is critical
   if accurate predictions are to be made on the fate of contaminants in
   the subsurface environment. In order to understand fully the
   hydrochemical mechanisms in the vadose zone it is essential that the
   dynamics of the hydrology can be suitably characterised. The correlation
   between moisture content and both bulk dielectric and resistivity
   properties of porous media is well established. Using suitably placed
   sensors in boreholes detailed depth profiles of dielectric and
   resistivity behaviour have been monitored over a period of two years at
   a Triassic Sherwood Sandstone aquifer field site at Hatfield, England.
   The borehole-borehole transmission radar and borehole resistivity
   profiles show a significant correlation. Through appropriate
   petrophysical relationships, derived from core samples, seasonal
   dynamics of the vadose zone are seen to illustrate the migration of
   wetting and drying fronts over the monitoring period. At a second field
   site in Eggborough, located 17 km from Hatfield, similar temporal
   changes in moisture content in the sandstone were observed using
   borehole radar profiles. Travel times of seasonal wetting fronts through
   the sandstone at both sites appear to be approximately 2 m per month.
   The retardation of this front propagation in the top 3 m is also common
   to both sites, suggesting that pollutant transport may be principally
   controlled by near surface sediments. The results have important
   consequences to existing groundwater modelling programmes that are being
   utilised to predict transfer of agricultural chemicals through the
   vadose zone. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate assessment of soil-water fluxes is essential in soil physics
   due to its direct implications in environmental, agronomical or
   hydrological applications. Field estimations of soil-water fluxes by
   `classical' hydraulic methods are often difficult to obtain. Moreover,
   water fluxes are highly variable in space and time. The obtainment of a
   reasonable estimate for this variable would require numerous measurement
   sites. However, such a requirement is rarely met. Thony et al. {[}CR
   Acad. Sci. Paris, Earth Planetary Sci. 325 (1997) 317] presented the
   experimental evidence of a linear relationship between the
   self-potential (SP) and the unsaturated soil-water flux. Therefore, this
   relationship would allow the indirect assessment of the water flux using
   electrical measurements. Such an approach would appear much more
   flexible and easier to perform than the current hydraulic measurements.
   The aim of this study is to experimentally investigate the existence and
   robustness of the flux-SP relationship for different soil types and
   pedoclimatic conditions.
   The soil-water fluxes and the SP were monitored in a long-term
   experiment involving two types of soils, contrasting in hydraulic and
   electric properties. The soils were placed in lysimeters which were
   instrumented with tensiometers and TDR probes for monitoring hydraulic
   heads and moisture content, respectively. Unpolarizable SP electrodes,
   temperature sensors and suction cups (for collecting pore water) were
   also installed in the lysimeters. The SP and the fluxes were measured or
   calculated in the 30-40 cm depth section.
   Results show that the variations of the SP with time were clearly linked
   to both rainfall events and evaporation. However, in the long-term, the
   linear relationship between the unsaturated water flux and the SP
   evolves from strongly correlated to almost not correlated. The slope
   (sensitivity) of the flux-SP relationship varies with the soil type,
   decreasing with more electrically conductive soil. Taking into account a
   varying soil-electrode contact greatly improves the flux-SP relationship
   at the scale of the rainfall event, particularly when considering
   infiltration and drainage phases separately. Nevertheless, at the scale
   of a year, with alternated rainfalls and evaporation phases, the
   robustness of the relationship decreases (i.e. the coefficients of the
   relationship vary between events). This variability could be related to
   time variations in electrical conductivity, not so much to that of the
   soil-water, but rather to that of the water from the salted soil mud
   added to the SP electrodes at the time of installation.
   This study points out methodological problems associated with the
   measurement of SP in shallow unsaturated soils over the long-term and
   the need for designing specific electrodes for this purpose. However, in
   deep soils beneath the root zone, environmental conditions generally
   vary slowly and lightly in comparison to surface horizons. In this case
   and with our present set of SP measurement devices, the flux-SP
   relationship could be more stable than in the surface soil horizons and
   useful for examining aquifer recharge, capillary rises or contaminant
   transfer. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Computed X-ray tomography images of dry undisturbed soil samples of the
   coarse sandy loam of Korkusova Hut (KH) and the fine sand of Hupselse
   Beek (HB) are analysed concerning the image resolution, the direction of
   scanning and the evaluation of boundaries between the fast and slow flow
   domains. The image resolution appears to be a less important factor than
   the direction of scanning. Additional data sets are recommended for
   partitioning the fast and slow flow domains. Comparison is made with the
   tracer breakthrough pictures, magnetic resonance (MR) images and outflow
   volumes obtained from infiltration outflow experiments. The two soils
   under study appeared to have essentially different flow dynamics. In the
   KH sandy loam soil, the fast flow occurs in regions of high local
   porosity. In case of the HB fine sand, the sample appeared to consist of
   a dense part, where the flow process took place, and a more porous part,
   which stayed dry. Flow instability was detected on MR images for the KH
   soil. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The ground penetration radar (GPR) can be used for soil water content
   measurements. To prove the accuracy of the GPR, measurements were
   carried out on four lysimeters (surface 1 m(2), depth 1.5 m) during one
   vegetation period. The lysimeters were planted with lucerne and filled
   with three different soils: a loamy sand, a sandy loam and a silt loam.
   The ground water tables were at 1.35 and 2.1 m. The lysimeters were
   weighed, so that it was possible to calculate the changes in water
   content with very high accuracy. For the GPR-measurements a 1
   GHz-antenna was used. Only in the sandy loam reflected signal from the
   bottom of the lysimeter could be obtained. The standard deviation
   between the GPR and the lysimeter data was 0.01 m(3)/m(3) using all data
   and 0.0026 m(3)/m(3) using only measurements in the wetter range. For
   this material an experimental calibration curve between the soil water
   content (theta) and the relative dielectric constant (epsilon) was
   calculated by comparing GPR-results with lysimeter data. The data
   results in a linear function theta(epsilon) for the measured range of
   water contents. Compared to published calibration curves used for
   TDR-technique, the Topp-function gives the best results. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The behaviour of streaming potential is directly related to movement of
   groundwater. The responses for typical subsurface flows are modelled to
   investigate possibilities of spontaneous polarization (SP) when
   performing quantitative data interpretation. The physical properties of
   geomaterials related to streaming potential are described. A magnitude
   range of streaming current coefficient is assessed for geomaterials and
   found to be from -10(-10) to -10(-8) A/Pa m, depending on water salinity
   and rock composition. The electrical sources of SP caused by groundwater
   flow in saturated media are theoretically described. It is shown that SP
   is completely defined by three types of electrical sources situated (1)
   on boundaries where water enters or quits porous media, (2) in areas
   with transient regime, and (3) on the boundaries of rocks with different
   properties (hydraulic conductivity, streaming current coefficients and
   electrical conductivity). A 2D-computer program based on the method of
   finite difference was created to provide numerical successive modelling
   of both groundwater flow and SP. Using Sill's {[}Geophysics 48 (1983)
   76] approach, first the water heads are calculated. Then, electrical
   sources of SP are obtained on the basis of the calculated heads and
   coefficient of streaming current. Finally, the SP is obtained on the
   basis of calculated electrical sources and subsurface electrical
   conductivity. Numerical examples illustrating SP responses of
   infiltration, of barrage with different electrical conductivity, and of
   well pumping are discussed. Field data obtained at the site containing
   the dam between superficial artificial reservoir and the river are
   interpreted on the basis of numerical modelling. The discussed method
   can be mainly used for additional calibration of groundwater flow
   models. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   homogeneous sand was set up to realize infiltration experiments. We
   compared the parameter distribution calculated from measurements of a
   ground penetrating radar system (GPR) with a simulated water content
   distribution using a two-dimensional numerical model based on the Van
   Genuchten-Mualem approach in order to assess the effectiveness of the
   geophysical measure for the characterization of soil water content
   variations. A statistical examination of both simulated water contents
   based on independent measured soil properties and reflection amplitudes
   from radargrams indicated a better conformity between geophysical data
   and simulated water contents assuming a heterogeneous hydraulic
   parameter distribution. The heterogeneous nature of the sand body could
   be confirmed by dye tracer experiments. The analyzed GPR attribute, the
   distribution of the maximum reflection amplitudes, may serve in future
   studies as an indicator for the expected water content heterogeneity in
   sandy soils. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The predictive capability of groundwater flow models is frequently
   restricted by insufficient characterisation of a typically heterogeneous
   and anisotropic subsurface. Trace levels of volatile organic compounds
   have been detected at municipal water supply wells in Gray, Maine.
   Groundwater flow modelling based on available hydrogeologic data defines
   a dominant W-E transport vector that is inconsistent with the apparent
   N40E transport of a plume emanating from a road salt storage facility,
   as mapped with a terrain conductivity instrument.
   A local-scale geophysical study at an undisturbed site in the
   glacial-marine delta deposit aquifer was conducted to investigate the
   possible influence of anisotropy on flow through these unconsolidated
   sediments. Ground penetrating radar and terrain conductivity
   measurements reveal evidence for structural features that are likely to
   promote preferential transport paths orientated in a general NE-SW
   direction. Two conductive tracers, one deep and one surficial, were
   injected and monitored for direct evaluation of the groundwater flow
   vector using resistivity and self potential methods. Although
   interpretation was limited by an incomplete resistivity dataset, the
   results and modelling of both methods supports a general N30E-N40E flow
   vector. Furthermore, consistent flow velocity estimates (similar to0.15
   m/day) are obtained from the two methods. Analysis of this integrated
   dataset suggests that anisotropy exerts a significant control on flow in
   this unconsolidated aquifer. Predictions of sources of groundwater
   contamination at municipal wells based on flow models not accounting for
   this anisotropy will likely be in error. This study illustrates the
   potential value of an integrated geophysical study, which will aid the
   development of accurate flow models for unconsolidated aquifers. (C)

Title = {{Three-dimensional imaging of pore water diffusion and motion in porous

Abstract = {{We report on the use of a pulsed gradient spin-echo imaging sequence for
   the three-dimensional (3D) imaging of water transport properties in two
   porous media: 2 mm glass-beads and 0.15 turn quartz-sand mixed with 2
   turn glass-beads. In contrast to tracer methods, which monitor the
   tracer motion by its effect on the signal relaxation of H-1, this
   sequence measures the echo signal intensity I-0 without and I with
   applied diffusion gradient, respectively. For the wide-pore glass-bead
   system, the intensity loss is controlled by nearly free self-diffusion
   in the pores. A mean apparent diffusion coefficient is calculated from
   the ratio ln(I-0/I) as <D-loc> = 1.9 x 10(-9) m(2) s(-1), which is
   slightly lower than that of free water (D = 2.3 x 10(-9) m(2) s(-1)).
   Increasing the mean pore flow velocity from 0 to 0.14 mm s(-1) results
   in a linear increase of <D-loc> to 2.3 x 10(-9) m(2) s(-1), caused by
   mechanical dispersion. The spatial distribution is of the log-normal
   type, where the width increases with increasing pore velocity.
   Correlation lengths are also calculated.
   For the fine porous medium, frequent contacts of the water molecules
   with the pore boundaries lead to a significant decrease of I-0 by
   increased T-2 relaxation. The resulting ratio of the signal intensities
   ln(I-0/I) is then smaller than expected for pure diffusion, which is
   caused by the restricted diffusion in the fine pore system. The spatial
   distribution (normal) is broader than for the glass-bead system and the
   mean local apparent diffusion coefficient is calculated as 1 x 10(-9)
   m(2) s(-1), a dependence on the pore flow velocity could not be
   detected.
   For the glass-bead system, the 3D image clearly shows regions of
   increased dispersivity (50\% greater than the D-loc), caused by packing
   errors, leading to preferential flow. This macroscopic effect on the
   column scale is quantified by a numerical simulation of tracer
   transport, based on the 3D diffusion coefficient field, assuming a
   linear relation to local velocities. From this simulation, the effective
   dispersion coefficient is obtained for the column scale (D-eff = 130 x
   10(-9) m(2) s(-1)), which is comparable to that obtained from classical
   break-through curves with tracer substances. (C) 2002 Published by

Abstract = {{Hole-surface and hole-hole mise-a-la-masse (MALM) measurements and
   surface self-potential (SP) measurements were taken over a 173-day
   period during an 8-well, radial injection, tracer experiment in
   partially saturated, fractured, Columbia River basalt. A potassium
   chloride tracer stream was injected into the fractured basalt and was
   energized directly for the MALM experiments. The constant concentration,
   tracer solution was injected for 76 days above a perched water table at
   an average rate of 10.07 l/day. Tracer injection was followed by a
   34-day period of tap water injection and a 63-day drainage period. The
   associated changes in potential distributions and SP's over time
   indicate that an asymmetrical, vadose zone plume evolved in the
   fractured basalt. Hole-surface and SP measurements were used to track
   the lateral evolution of the tracer plume; however, there was some noise
   and variability in the SP data. The hole-hole measurements helped
   delineate the depth of preferential tracer migration in the fractured

Abstract = {{The flow and transport of a non-reactive tracer and melt water was
   monitored in a heterogeneous coarse sandy unsaturated zone in
   southeastern Norway, during the snowmelt of 2001. Electrical resistivity
   tomography (ERT) as well as conventional suction cup techniques was
   employed. A frozen solution of NaBr in water was supplied as a line
   source on the ground surface above two parallel vertical profiles
   monitored by the two measurement systems prior to the onset of snowmelt.
   The two monitored vertical profiles were separated by approximately 1 m.
   The results were analysed by visual comparison of images and by the use
   of spatial moments analysis. The two measurement approaches showed that
   the system was affected by the presence of preferential flow paths
   during the early stages of the snowmelt, perhaps due to ice near the
   surface, but the major part of the plume moves uniformly later in the
   snow-melting period. After most of the tracer plume has reached the
   depth monitored by both systems (i.e. below 0.4 m depth) there is a good
   consistency between the two datasets. Spatial moment calculations on the
   basis of ERT cannot be used to describe the movement of tracer alone, as
   the resistivity is affected by changes in both saturation levels and
   tracer concentration. Nevertheless, ERT appears to be an appropriate
   method to characterise regions of localised high infiltration in this
   type of soil. The method therefore constitutes a possible alternative
   and supplement to suction cups in a monitoring system. (C) 2002 Elsevier

   analysis has made it possible to characterize phase distribution and
   pore geometry in porous media using non-destructive X-ray computed

   partially saturated media, obtained with different scanning systems and
   sample sizes, to illustrate advantages and limitations of these various
   systems, including topics of spatial resolution and contrast. In
   addition, we present examples of our most recent three-dimensional
   high-resolution images, for which it was possible to resolve individual
   pores and to delineate air-water interfacial contacts. This kind of
   resolution provides a novel opportunity to follow the dynamic flow
   behavior on the pore scale and to verify new theoretical and numerical
   modeling approaches. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Risk management has been established as a well defined procedure for
   handling risks due to natural, environmental or man made hazards, of
   which floods are representative. Risk management has been discussed in
   many previous papers giving different meanings to the term-a result of
   the fact that risk management actually takes place on three different
   levels of actions: the operational level, which is associated with
   operating an existing system, a project planning level, which is used
   when a new, or a revision of an existing project is planned, and a
   project design level, which is embedded into the second level and
   describes the process of reaching an optimal solution for the project.
   The first two levels will be briefly described in the paper. It will be
   emphasized that the transition from the first to the second level is a
   dynamic process. As the value system of a nation changes, and as the
   natural boundary conditions are modified by human actions or global
   changes, an existing system will be found not meeting the demands of the
   present society, and actions on the second level are initiated. The
   decisions for change depend on the changes in options available for
   handling a flood situation, as well as on the changes in risk perception
   and attitudes towards risk. On the third level, the actual cost of a
   design are evaluated and compared with the benefits obtained from the
   planned project. In particular, on this level the residual risk is
   considered, i.e. the risk which remains even after a project is
   completed and fully operational. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Creating flood expansion areas e.g. for the protection of urban areas
   from flooding involves a localised increase in risk which may require
   farmers to be compensated for crop damage or other losses. With this in
   mind, the paper sets out the approach used to study the problem and
   gives results obtained from a survey of farms liable to flooding in
   central France. The approach is based on a study of decisions made by
   farmers in situations of uncertainty, using the concept of `model of
   action'. The results show that damage caused to farming areas by
   flooding should be considered both at field level and at farm level. The
   damage caused to the field depends on the flood itself, the fixed
   characteristics of the field, and the plant species cultivated. However,
   the losses to the farm taken as a whole can differ considerably from
   those for the flooded field, due to `knock-on' effects on farm
   operations which depend on the internal organization, the availability
   of production resources, and the farmer's objectives, both for the farm
   as a whole and for its individual enterprises. Three main strategies
   regarding possible flood events were identified. Reasons for choosing
   one of these include the way the farmer perceives the risk and the size
   of the area liable to flooding. Finally, the formalisation of farm
   system management in the face of uncertainty, especially due to
   flooding, enables compensation to be calculated for farmers whose land
   is affected by the creation of flood expansion areas. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to analyse the impact of errors in radar
   rainfall estimates on rainfall-runoff modelling. This issue is addressed
   through application of radar rainfall estimates for continuous, lumped
   rainfall-runoff modelling of the Brue catchment, a mid-sized basin in
   South-West England, over a two and a half-year period. The study is
   focused on radar rainfall errors associated with range-related bias due
   to the vertical profile of reflectivity and with mean-field bias due to
   systematic errors in the radar calibration and biased
   reflectivity-to-rainrate relationship. Streamflow is simulated through a
   conceptual hydrological model based on mean areal rainfall estimates
   obtained by using various radar rainfall processing scenarios. These
   simulations are evaluated and compared with corresponding streamflow
   simulations from a dense raingauge network. The comparisons show that
   radar errors may preclude the use of unadjusted radar estimates for
   runoff modelling. Radar rainfall adjustment significantly improves model
   results with simulation efficiency increasing up to 30\% after
   adjustment. Comparison of radar-driven simulations with observed
   discharge data reveals a simulation efficiency of 0.75 for the lowest
   radar scan (adjusted), whereas simulation efficiencies are lower for
   higher radar scans. The results reveal the critical importance of using
   radar rainfall estimates as close as possible to the ground and the
   considerable impact that effects of vertical variability of reflectivity
   have on runoff simulation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Flood forecasting may be improved by coupling atmospheric and
   hydrological models. To investigate the current potential of such an
   approach in complex mountain watersheds, the authors carried out a
   number of combined high-resolution one-way driven model experiments to
   generate runoff hydrographs for seven extreme flood events which
   occurred in the Lago Maggiore basin between 1993 and 2000. The Alpine
   Ticino-Verzasca-Maggia basin (2627 km(2)) is located directly to the
   south of the main Alpine ridge embracing a great part of the drainage
   area of Lago Maggiore. For this basin, the grid-based hydrological
   catchment model WaSiM-ETH was employed to determine the continuous
   runoff hydrographs. In the model experiments, two different sets of
   meteorological input data were used: (1) surface observation data from
   station measurements and from weather radar, and (2) forecast data from
   five different high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) models
   with grid cell sizes between 2 and 14 km.
   This paper presents and compares selected results of these flood runoff
   simulations with particular attention to the experimental design of the
   model coupling. The configuration and initialization of the hydrological
   model runs are outlined as well as the down-scale techniques which
   proved to provide an adequate spatial interpolation of the
   meteorological variables onto the 500 m X 500 m grid of the hydrological
   model. In order to evaluate the various hydrological model results as
   generated from the different outputs from the five NWP models, some
   coupled experiments with `non-standard' NWP model outputs have been
   carried out. In particular, the results of these sensitivity studies
   point to inherent limits of high-resolution flood runoff predictions in
   complex mountain terrain. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The impact of a climate change scenario on regional climate conditions
   and runoff characteristics has been investigated for the Mulde
   catchment, a meso-scale sub-basin of the Elbe in Germany. First, the
   semi-distributed, conceptual model HBV-D has been successfully applied
   to simulate discharge for present climate conditions. Further, the
   expanded downscaling method (EDS) was calibrated and applied to observed
   global circulation fields in order to produce local climate input data
   for HBV-D. Finally, the coupled atmosphere-ocean model ECHAM4/OPYC3,
   driven by a climate change scenario, provided simulated global
   circulation patterns for application with EDS. The regionalised scenario
   conditions then served as input to HBV-D in order to investigate the
   impact of global climate change on regional hydrology. The results
   indicate that an obvious increase in temperature is accompanied by a
   clear tendency to reduced precipitation over the investigated area for
   the next 100 years. These conditions lead to a decrease in simulated
   mean discharges of the Mulde. The study is considered to be a
   contribution for regional impact studies on global climate change. At
   the same time, it demonstrates existing shortcomings and limitations of
   current climate impact research. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Scientific evidence indicates that a global climate change due to human
   activity is possible within a century. It is expected that doubling Of
   CO2 and increasing the amount of other greenhouse gases in the
   atmosphere would result in more severe weather, among other
   consequences. The purpose of the paper is to examine how flood
   frequencies and magnitudes in a midsize subalpine watershed on the
   eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, Canada, would change
   under 2 X CO2 conditions. Given the poor spatial resolution of present
   general circulation models (GCM) and their uncertain performance at the
   regional scale, a first-order analysis is carried on, in which only
   rainfall intensity changes are considered to have the most significant
   impact on future floods. Estimates of storm rainfall increases are based
   on the literature survey, GCM projections for the study area, and
   transposition of southern climatic conditions. Two scenarios of likely
   most severe changes were selected: first, a 25\% increase in the mean
   and standard deviation of Gumbel distribution of rainfall depth for
   storm durations from 6 to 48 h; second, a 50\% increase in the standard
   deviation only. The HEC-1 watershed model and the soil conservation
   service runoff curve method for abstractions were used in Monte Carlo
   simulation. Comparison of Monte Carlo derived flood frequency curves for
   the two scenarios with the present day curve shows that scenario I is
   more critical in terms of flood flow increases than scenario 2. Under
   scenario 1, the mean annual flood on the study watershed would increase
   by almost 80\% and the 100-year flood would increase by 41\%. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Various runoff processes with widely varying infiltration and retention
   capacities, such as Hortonian overland flow, saturation overland flow
   and fast subsurface flow, form storm runoff in catchments. Areas can be
   classified according to these different runoff processes on the basis of
   information on soil characteristics, geology, topography, and land use.
   The results of such classifications can be verified with infiltration
   experiments combined with tracer techniques.
   A reduction of storm runoff by a change of land use or land use
   management practices is only feasible on sites, where infiltration and
   matrix wetting can be enhanced. In order to estimate the effects of
   possible land use changes on storm runoff, the spatial distribution of
   the dominant runoff processes and the actual land use was assessed in a
   meso-scale catchment in the state of Rheinland Pfalz, Germany. Based on
   assumptions on how changes in land use might influence the runoff
   processes, the potential for flood runoff reduction could be estimated.

Abstract = {{The impact of land-use change impacts on storm-runoff generation is
   presented based on a simulation study composed of three parts: (1)
   generation of spatially explicit land-use scenarios; (2) spatially
   distributed and process based hydrological modelling of runoff
   generation; (3) application of this procedure and demonstration of
   results for a predominantly agricultural meso-scale catchment in a
   loessy-soil landscape in SW Germany.
   Land-use scenarios are a prerequisite for assessing the influence of
   potential changes of land-use and/or land-cover on runoff generation.
   The land-use change modelling kit (LUCK) provides a method for the
   spatial transformation of overall trends of land-use into spatially
   distributed scenarios of land-use patterns, taking into account their
   topology in a true position mode. The assignment of land-use categories
   to each grid cell is realised in a spatially explicit manner, dependent
   on an evaluation of the site characteristics as well as its
   neighbourhood relationships.
   Based on these land-use scenarios, the influence of altered land-use
   characteristics on flooding is simulated using a modified version of the
   physically based hydrological model WaSiM-ETH. In order to extend the
   model's capabilities with respect to adequate representation of land-use
   related runoff generation mechanisms, some additional mechanisms have
   been introduced: (1) A macropore module accounting for fast infiltration
   processes; (2) A siltation module decreasing hydraulic conductivity of
   the soil surface as a function of precipitation intensity and vegetation
   coverage. (3) Sub-grid variability considering the impervious and sealed
   portion of a grid cell. The location and lateral interaction of
   landscape elements within a catchment is captured by spatially explicit
   modelling on the basis of gridded information provided by the scenarios.
   The whole simulation procedure is applied to a meso-scale catchment in
   SW Germany. The results show that the influence of land-use conditions
   on storm-runoff generation depends greatly on the rainfall event
   characteristics and on the related spatial scale, i.e. the influence is
   only relevant for convective storm events with high precipitation
   intensities in contrast to long-lasting advective storm events with low
   precipitation intensities. However, convective events-and thus land-use
   conditions-are of very minor relevance for the formation of floods in
   large river basins because this type of rainfall event is usually
   restricted to small-scale occurrence. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The subject of the present paper is the flood situation in the German
   part of the Elbe river. For this, no (international) agreement could be
   reached till now. Problems occur due to missing, non-plausible or
   uncertain flow data and due to non-stationary hydrological conditions in
   the basin caused by climatological variability and human impact (diking
   and installation of reservoirs). Regarding this complex hydrological
   situation a systematic procedure consisting of existing hydrological
   tools was developed. In a harmonised and complementary structure this
   procedure mainly includes the consistency analysis of flow data,
   statistical analyses of the flow process, especially flood statistics
   and their regionalisation, stochastic simulations of the flow process in
   the basin and flow routing. Therewith a stepwise increasingly reliable,
   representative, detailed and funded knowledge of the flow process may be
   achieved. Till now complete longitudinal sections of statistical flood
   parameters along the German part of the watercourse were determined for
   a sufficiently long period (1964-1995) best reflecting the present
   situation. Moreover, approximative flood statistics could be derived for
   a longer period (1936-1995), which may be regarded as representative for
   the variable hydrological conditions during the 20th century.
   In addition to this fundamental study the tools were applied in order to
   contribute to a decision support with respect to the presently discussed
   measures of dike shifting. The analyses revealed that a significant
   impact of these measures-even the impact of all measures together-on
   flood peaks may be achieved only if control systems at the sites of the
   retention spaces are used.
   Finally, the paper considers options of a further utilisation of the
   hydrological analysis results by the definition of interfaces to other
   disciplines. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{For several hundreds of years the River Rhine has been influenced by
   human activities. This has changed the flood routing down the river. In
   particular weirs, which have been constructed along the Oberrhein from
   1929 to 1977, and retention measures, which have been taken during the
   last years in order to reduce peak flow, have influenced the flood
   conditions along the River Rhine substantially.
   To quantify the effects of these measures upon flooding in the region of
   the Niederrhein in Germany and in The Netherlands, flood routing models
   were used and flood statistics were carried out using time series, which
   were homogenised for different river conditions using the results from
   the flood simulation. In addition synthetic floods were simulated in
   order to investigate the effects of the flood reducing measures upon
   very high flood peaks with return periods of 200, 500, 1000 and 1250
   years.
   The results are the base for the definition of design floods in
   North-Rhine-Westphalia, Germany as well as in The Netherlands. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Bank filtration, either natural or induced through the river bed by
   pumping from a system of connected lateral or vertical wells, provides a
   means of obtaining public water supplies. The success of such schemes is
   dependent on the microbial activity and chemical transformations that
   are commonly enhanced in the colmation layer within the river bed
   compared to those that take place in surface or ground waters. The
   actual biogeochemical interactions that sustain the quality of the
   pumped bank filtrate depend on numerous factors including aquifer
   mineralogy, shape of the aquifer, oxygen and nitrate concentrations in
   the surface water, types of organic matter in the surface and ground
   water environments, and land use in the local catchment area. This paper
   provides an introduction to a series of nine papers contained in this
   Special Issue that highlight these factors and finishes with a list of
   recommendations for co-ordinated research into attenuation of
   groundwater pollution by bank filtration. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{The Dusseldorf waterworks have been using riverbank filtration since
   1870 with bank filtration as the most important source for public water
   supply in this densely populated and industrialised region. There have
   been many threats to this supply in the last few decades-e.g. poor river
   water quality, heavy clogging of the riverbed, accidental
   pollution-which had to be overcome. First field studies in the river
   Rhine were carried out with a diving cabin in 1953 and 1954 to
   investigate riverbed clogging during high loads of organic contaminants
   in the river water. In 1987 a second investigation of the riverbed
   followed in the same area during which time the water quality of the
   river had improved. After the Sandoz accident in 1986 a joint research
   project was carried out in the Lower Rhine region to improve knowledge
   of flow and transport phenomena of riverbank filtration and to develop
   numerical models for the dynamic simulation of flow and transport. The
   main objective of the field studies was to gain more insight into the
   dynamic river-aquifer interactions and the effects of fluctuating river
   levels. These fluctuations are not only relevant for clogging processes
   and the velocities and residence times in the subsoil, but can also
   affect the quality of the well water. Depth-orientated sampling in the
   adjacent aquifer was employed. One important finding was a marked
   age-stratification of the bank-filtered water which balances out
   fluctuating concentrations of dissolved compounds in the river water.

Abstract = {{Wells placed next to surface-water bodies to induce infiltration have
   come under scrutiny because of the presence of the potential pathogens
   in surface water. Removal of pathogens and other contaminants by bank
   filtration is assumed, but regulatory agencies question the
   effectiveness of this process. To investigate transport processes of
   biological constituents, advective groundwater traveltimes to production
   wells under the influence of surface water need to be established first
   to determine appropriate water-quality sampling schedules.
   This paper presents the results of a study of bank filtration at a well
   field in southwestern Ohio. Field parameters such as water level,
   specific conductance, and water temperature were measured at least
   hourly at a streamflow gaging station and at five monitoring wells each
   at two separate sites, corresponding to two nearby production wells.
   Water-quality samples also were collected in all wells and the
   streamflow gaging station.
   Specific conductance is directly related to concentration of chloride, a
   chemically conservative constituent. Cross-correlation methods were used
   to determine the average traveltime from the river to the monitoring
   wells. Traveltimes based on specific conductance ranged from
   approximately 20 h to 10 days at one site and 5 days to 3 months at the
   other site. Calculated groundwater flow velocities ranged from 2.1 x
   10(-3) to 6.0 x 10(-3) cm/s and 3.5 x 10(-4) to 7.1 x 10(-4) cm/s at the
   two sites. Data collected when a production well is continuously pumping
   reveal shorter and more consistent traveltimes than when the same well
   is pumped intermittently. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In urban areas such as Berlin (Germany) with high municipal sewage water
   discharges and low surface water flows there is a potential risk of
   drinking water contamination by polar organic compounds when groundwater
   recharge is used in drinking water production. Thus, some
   pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are not eliminated completely
   in the municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs) and they are discharged
   as contaminants into the receiving waters. In terms of several
   monitoring studies carried out in Berlin between 1996 and 2000, PhACs
   such as clofibric acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, propyphenazone, primidone
   and carbamazepine were detected at individual concentrations up to the
   mu/I-level in influent and effluent samples from STPs and in all surface
   water samples collected downstream from the STPs. Under recharge
   conditions, several compounds were also found at individual
   concentrations up to 7.3 mug/I in samples collected from groundwater
   aquifers near to contaminated water courses. A few of the PhACs were
   also identified at the ng/I-level in Berlin tap water samples. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The changes in triazine and acetamide concentrations in water during
   natural and artificial treatment by bank filtration, ozonation,
   filtration, and chlorination were measured at the well field and
   drinking water treatment plant of Lincoln, Nebraska, USA. The city's
   groundwater supply is affected by induced infiltration and transport of
   triazines and acetamide herbicides from the Platte River in late spring
   and early summer. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect
   of infiltration and treatment on the presence of triazines and
   acetamides in drinking water. Samples of river water, well water, and
   public supply water at various stages of water treatment were collected
   from 1997-1999 during spring-runoff when the presence of herbicides in
   the Platte River is largest. In 1999, parent compounds were reduced by
   76\% of the concentration present in river water (33\% by bank
   filtration, 41\% by ozonation, and 1.5\% by chlorination). Metabolites
   of herbicides for which analytical techniques existed were reduced by
   21\% (plus 26\% by bank filtration, minus 23\% by ozonation, and minus
   24\% by chlorination). However, increases in concentrations of specific
   metabolite compounds were identified after bank filtration and
   ozonation. After bank filtration, increases in cyanazine amide,
   cyanazine acid, and deethyleyanazine acid were identified. After
   ozonation, concentrations of deisopropylatrazine, deethylatrazine,
   didealkylatrazine, atrazine amide-I, hydroxydeethylatrazine,
   hydroxydeisopopylatrazine, deethylcyanazine acid, and deethylcyanazine
   increased. Concentrations of cyanazine acid and ethanesulfonic and
   oxanilic acids of acetamides decreased during ozonation. Our findings
   suggest that bank filtration and ozonation of water in part can shift
   the assessment of risk to human health associated with the consumption
   of the water from the parent compounds to their degradation products.

Abstract = {{in semi-arid areas, pumping town water supplies from alluvium adjacent a
   stream rather than the stream itself has been used to reduce turbidity
   and has potential to remove blue-green algal toxins, such as
   microsystin. However for some rivers, such as the River Murray in South
   Eastern Australia, the ambient groundwater of unconfined aquifers
   skirting some reaches of the river is saline. This paper examines the
   compatibility of two constraints on the quality of water recovered from
   bank filtration schemes; that (1) removal of cyanobacterial toxins is
   adequate and (2) salinity is acceptable for drinking water supplies.
   Adsorption and biodegradation characteristics of a cyanobacterial
   hepatotoxin, microsystin, in porous media were quantified and these
   results are summarised in the current analysis. It was found that
   riverbank filtration schemes could meet both criteria in a limited range
   of conditions, excluding locations where saline groundwater discharges
   to a river. However, on a river meander that had been flushed due to a
   hydraulic gradient induced by a lock, several feasible positions for
   bank filtration wells were compared and a best location meeting salinity
   and microsystin criteria with least-energy pumping cost was identified.
   The simple approach developed is intended to be used to assess
   feasibility of alternative designs for bank filtration schemes in
   semiarid areas before commencing field studies. Crown Copyright (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Bank filtration employs a natural filtration process of surface water on
   its flow path from the river to the well. The development of a stable
   filter layer is of major importance to the quality of the delivered
   water. Flooding is expected to destabilise the riverbed, to reduce the
   filter efficiency of the bank and therefore to endanger the operation of
   water supply facilities near the riverbank. This paper provides an
   example of how bank storage in an unconfined alluvial aquifer causes a
   significant decrease of the seepage rate after a high-water event.
   Extensive monitoring equipment has been installed in the river bank of
   the oligotrophic alpine River Enns focusing on the first metre of the
   flow path. Head losses measured by multilevel probes throughout a year
   characterise the development of the hydraulic conductivity of different
   riverbed layers. Concentration profiles of nitrate, total ions and a
   NaCl tracer have been used to study infiltration rates of river water
   and its dilution with groundwater. Dynamic modelling was applied in
   order to investigate the propagation of flood induced head elevation and
   transport of pollutants. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Riparian municipal wells, that are located on riverbanks, are
   specifically designed to capture a portion of the river water through
   induced infiltration. Runoff from agricultural watersheds is found to
   carry enormous amounts of pesticides and nitrate. While the risk of
   contamination for a vast majority of sites with small-capacity vertical
   wells is low, potential exists for medium to large capacity collector
   wells to capture a fraction of the surface water contaminants during
   flood. Prior monitoring and current modeling results indicate that a
   small-capacity (peak pumpage 0.0315 m(3)/s) vertical bank filtration
   well may not be affected by river water nitrate and atrazine even during
   flood periods. For a medium capacity (0.0875-0.175 m(3)/s) hypothetical
   collector well at the same site, potential exists for a portion of the
   river water nitrate and atrazine to enter the well during flood periods.
   Various combinations of hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed or bank
   material were used. For nitrate, it was assumed either no
   denitrification occurred during the period of simulation or a half-life
   of 2 years. Equilibrium controlled sorption (organic carbon partition
   coefficient of 52 ml/g) and a half-life of between 7.5 and 15 weeks were
   considered for atrazine. Combinations of these parameters were used in
   various simulations. Peak concentrations of atrazine or nitrate in
   pumped water could vary from less than 1\% to as high as 90\% of that in
   the river. It was found that a combination of river stage, pumping
   rates, hydraulic properties of the riverbed and bank, and soil/pesticide
   properties could affect contaminant entry from river water to any of
   these wells. If the hydraulic conductivity of the bed and bank material
   were low, atrazine would not reach the pumping well with or without
   sorption and degradation. However, for moderately low permeable bank and
   bed materials, some atrazine from river water could enter a hypothetical
   collector well while pumping at 0.0875 m(3)/s. It was interesting to
   note that doubling the pumpage of this collector well would bring in
   more ground water from the aquifer (with no atrazine) and thus have a
   lower concentration of atrazine in the filtrate. For highly conductive
   banks, it is possible to find some atrazine at a vertical well for a
   sustained pumpage rate of 0.0125 m(3)/s if the effect of sorption is
   neglected. However, with equilibrium sorption, the concentration would
   be below the detection limit. On the other hand, if a collector well of
   capacity 0.0875 m(3)/s is used at the place of the vertical well with
   highly conductive banks, atrazine concentration in the filtrate would be
   about 80\% of river water even assuming equilibrium sorption and a
   half-life of 7.5 weeks. Remediation of river water contamination of the
   aquifer using `scavenger' wells between the river and the pumping
   well(s) was not a feasible option due to the contact of the aquifer with
   a highly conductive bank at the site. However, moving the existing
   pumping well(s) 100 m upstream would have negligible impact from the
   bank-stored water. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Based on a two-step laboratory test including biodegradation and
   adsorption, it is possible to derive a prognosis of the behaviour of
   organic compounds during riverbank filtration and to prioritise the
   substances with regard to drinking water quality. It is shown for
   aromatic amines, used as an example of organics found in River Elbe
   water, Germany, how the simulation methods provide basic information
   about rate constants of biological degradation and adsorption
   equilibrium constants under conditions that are as realistic as
   possible. Biodegradation of nitroanilines and higher chlorinated
   anilines is relatively slow and adsorption onto the sandy aquifer
   material is weak. Accordingly, occurrence of these compounds in the
   production wells of the waterworks cannot be excluded. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In riverbank filtration, the removal of organic contaminants is an
   important task for the production of good quality drinking water. The
   transport of an organic contaminant in riverbank filtration can be
   retarded by sorption on to the solid matrix and facilitated by the
   presence of mobile colloids. In the presence of dissolved organic matter
   (DOM) and bacteria, the subsurface environment can be modeled as a
   four-phase porous medium: two mobile colloidal phases, an aqueous phase,
   and a solid matrix. In this study, a kinetic model is developed to
   simulate the contaminant transport in riverbank filtration in the
   presence of DOM and bacteria. The bacterial deposition and the
   contaminant sorption on bacteria and DOM are expressed with kinetic
   expressions. The model equations are solved numerically with a fully
   implicit finite difference method. Simulation results show that the
   contaminant mobility increases greatly in riverbank filtration due to
   the presence of DOM. The mobility can be enhanced further when the
   bacteria and DOM are present together in the aquifer. In this system,
   the total aqueous phase contaminant concentration, C-ct(+) includes the
   contaminant dissolved in the aqueous phase, C-c(+) the contaminant
   sorbed to DOM, sigma(cd)(+), and the contaminant sorbed to mobile
   bacteria, C(b)(+)sigma(cbm)(+),(i.e. C-ct(+) = C-c(+) + sigma(cd)(+) +
   C-b(+) sigma(cbm)(+)) Sensitivity analysis illustrates that the
   distribution of the total aqueous phase contaminants among the dissolved
   phase, DOM and bacteria is changed significantly with various Damkohler
   numbers related to the contaminant sorption on mobile colloids. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Many soils parameters and features play a role in explaining the
   hydrodynamic behaviour of a watershed. Textural data are relatively easy
   to obtain and to spatialise, due to their low spatial variability.
   Inversely, structural features usually exhibit great spatial variability
   and thus, are difficult to interpolate and to integrate in the framework
   of a hydrologic model. However, structural characteristics of the soils
   seem to have a greater influence on catchment hydrological balance than
   the textural ones.
   The objectives of this study were to identify which parameters control
   the soil surface hydrological behaviour and quantify the magnitude of
   their spatial variability.
   Measurements of soils characteristics, including bulk density and
   hydraulic conductivity, were carried out in five watersheds in the
   Western Sierra Madre (Northern Mexico). It is shown in this study that
   on a natural grassland under subtropical mountainous climate, spatial
   variability of soil hydraulic conductivity is almost as high at a 1-m(2)
   scale as at a 1-km(2) one.
   The main discriminating variables which account for the spatial
   variability appeared to be the lithology and overall the soil surface
   features, both being related. The latter seems to be a synthetic
   indicator of basin hydrodynamic behaviour, and to be easier than others
   to spatialise. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

   north-central Manitoba. The soils in the region vary from rapidly
   draining coarse sand to poorly drained areas of peat overlying clay,
   including wetlands. Observed surface fluxes from four sites, a young
   jack pine stand, an old jack pine stand, an old black spruce stand and a
   FEN, are scaled by proportional weighting to represent the study area.
   The performance of the mosaic approach, in which the region has been
   represented by four distinct patches, is compared with that of the
   aggregated approach, in which mean surface parameters have been defined
   based on fractional coverage. Various soil columns are employed in the
   aggregated approach, in order to assess the effects of representing the
   heterogeneous soils of the region in a single column.
   While the conservative water use at all of the sites limits the effects
   of changes in the soil column on the turbulent fluxes, important effects
   are noted. Soil evaporation is overestimated when an organic or
   composite soil layer is represented at the surface, and underestimated
   when a sandy soil column is represented. Soil evaporation can be
   calibrated to match that of the mosaic method, however, the need for
   more robust methods of accomplishing this is acknowledged. The process
   of aggregating the soil column eliminates the dry sandy zones which
   experience periods of moisture stress. This results in periods of
   increased canopy conductance and an overestimation of the latent heat
   flux. A 2-patch mosaic, with one patch consisting of sandy soil and the
   other patch of organic soil over clay, allows moisture stress to occur
   and produces modelled half-hourly sensible and latent heat fluxes that
   agree more closely to those of the 4-patch mosaic than any of the
   aggregated runs, across the range of hydrometeorological variables.
   Throughout the course of the model runs presented here, the 2-patch
   mosaic also exhibits cumulative drainage and evapotranspiration closer
   to that of the 4-patch mosaic than any of the aggregated soil columns.

Abstract = {{This study proposes a stochastic optimization technique that uses a
   gradient-based method as the primary optimization method, as well as a
   geostatistical conditional simulation to perturb and calibrate
   parameters at every local minimum. If the optimization process is
   trapped at a local minimum due to the limitations of the gradient-based
   method, it generates equiprobable parameter fields using a
   geostatistical. conditional simulation. Among the generated fields, the
   optimization process selects one that enables the objective function to
   be reduced below the value of that at the local minimum, and then
   reactivates the gradient-based optimization. In generating equi-probable
   parameter fields, a constrained number of points (noted as releasing
   points) are randomly selected, and spatially correlated values are
   generated at the releasing points, conditioned to optimum parameters at
   the local minimum.
   By applying the stochastic optimization to synthetic permeability
   fields, it is observed that an inversed permeability field reproduces
   not only global distribution but also local spatial variability of the
   reference fields. In addition, the pressure distributions of the
   inversed and the reference field were much alike. To investigate dynamic
   properties of the inversed field and the reference field, streamline
   simulation was performed on both fields. Streamlines of the inversed
   field showed similar trajectories to those of the reference field, and
   time of flight (TOF) distribution of the inversed field was analogous to
   that of the reference field.
   The stochastic optimization technique proposed in this paper enables an
   inverse process to converge to a global minimum while preserving
   geostatistical properties such as mean, standard deviation, and
   variogram of an original field. Therefore, the stochastic optimization
   will be efficient in predicting future performance of a field from
   constrained number of permeability and pressure observation data. (C)

Abstract = {{Phytoremediation is an emerging technology that uses plants and their
   associated rhizospheric microorganisms to remove, degrade, detoxify, or
   contain contaminants located in the soil, sediments, groundwater,
   surface water, and even the atmosphere. This study investigates
   phytoremediation of 1,4-dioxane from a contaminated sandy soil by a
   poplar cutting, which is associated with water flow in the soil as well
   as water movement and 1,4-dioxane translocation in the xylem and phloem
   systems. An existing one-dimensional mathematical model for coupled
   transport of water, heat, and solutes in the soil-plant-atmosphere
   continuum (CTSPAC) is modified for the purpose of this study. The model
   is calibrated with the laboratory experimental measurements prior to its
   applications. A simulation scenario is then performed to investigate
   phytoremediation of 1,4-dioxane by a poplar cutting in response to daily
   water flow and 1,4-dioxane transport for a simulation period of 7 days.
   Simulation shows that 1,4-dioxane concentration is high in leaves and
   low in roots with the stem in between. However, 1,4-dioxane mass in the
   stem (60\%) is higher than that of leaves (28\%) and roots (12\%). This
   occurs because the stem volume used in this study is larger than those
   of leaves and roots. The simulation further reveals that about 30\% of
   the soil 1,4-dioxane is removed within 7 days, resulting mainly from
   root uptake. A plot of the 1,4-dioxane concentrations in plant
   compartments as a function of time shows that the highest concentration
   in leaves is about 2600 mug/cm(3) and the lowest concentration in roots
   is about 350 mug/cm(3) at the end of the simulation. Results indicate
   that leaves are an important compartment for 1,4-dioxane accumulation
   and transpiration. This study suggests that the modified CTSPAC model
   could be a useful tool for phytoremediation estimations. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{In order to develop a methodology for reservoir flow modelling that
   takes into account the complexity of natural fracture systems,
   high-quality fracture datasets were collected at different scales in a
   well-exposed clastic formation at Tayma, Saudi Arabia, and used to
   design a multiscale fracture model incorporating both large-scale faults
   and medium- to small-scale fractures (joints) for numerical simulation.
   Flow modelling was then conducted, taking into account three scales of
   permeability to represent the matrix, joints, and faults. Actually, the
   most severe situation was considered, where the permeability of the
   joints dominates strongly the one of the matrix. The results obtained
   with this model show that, on a local scale, the maximum directional
   flow is always horizontal along the direction of a systematic joint
   set-in this case NW-SE. Vertical flow is only possible where joints j
   and bedding planes b have conductivity ratios C-j/C-b between 0.1 and
   10. The flow properties of the model were then upscaled to simulate the
   entire reservoir through combining the flow properties of the jointed
   matrix (represented by an equivalent permeability tensor) with those of
   the large-scale fault system (which was modelled explicitly) in a
   dual-permeability system. Simulation of a pumping well to illustrate the
   hydraulic response of the multiscale fracture system according to
   different permeability ratios between the faults and the jointed rock
   matrix, i.e. K-f/K-m, showed that the influence of the fault system
   begins to be visible at a permeability ratio of 100. At a ratio of
   10,000, the hydraulic potential field is controlled completely by the
   fault system, the fault planes becoming isopotential lines of the
   hydraulic field. This multiscale fracture flow simulation procedure,
   which combines the hydraulic effects of small- to medium-scale fractures
   and large-scale faults, could be very helpful in predicting flow
   responses in dual-permeability reservoirs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A model that incorporates a pseudo-random process controlled by
   mechanical rules of fracturing is used to generate 3D orthogonal joint
   networks in tabular stratified aquifers. The results presented here
   assume that two sets of fractures, each with different conductivities,
   coexist. This is the case in many aquifers or petroleum reservoirs that
   contain sets of fractures with distinct hydraulic properties related to
   each direction of fracturing. Constant rate pump-tests from partially
   penetrating wells are simulated in synthetic networks. The transient
   head response is analyzed using the type curve approach and plots, as a
   function of time, of pressure propagation in the synthetic network are
   shown. The hydrodynamic response can result in a pressure transient that
   is similar to a dual-porosity behavior, even though such an assumption
   was not made a priori. We show in this paper that this dual porosity
   like flow behavior is, in fact, related to the major role of the network
   connectivity, especially around the well, and to the aperture contrast
   between the different families of fractures that especially affects the
   earlier hydrodynamic response. Flow characteristics that may be
   interpreted as a dual porosity flow behavior are thus related to a
   lateral heterogeneity (large fracture or small fault). Accordingly, when
   a dual porosity model matches well test data, the resulting reservoir
   parameters can be erroneous because of the model assumptions basis that
   are not necessarily verified. Finally, it is shown both on simulated
   data and well test data that such confusion in the interpretation of the
   flow behavior can easily occur. Well test data from a single well must
   therefore be used cautiously to assess the flow properties of fractured
   reservoirs with lateral heterogeneities such as large fractures or small
   faults. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The concentration breakthrough curves at a pumping well for solute
   transport in a radially convergent flow field are governed by an
   advective-dispersive second order partial differential equation with a
   radial distance-dependent velocity and dispersion coefficient. The
   Laplace transform is generally first employed to eliminate the temporal
   derivative to solve the partial differential equation. The Laplace
   transformed equations are then converted to the standard form of the
   special Airy function through successive applications of variable
   change. This study presents the solution of the Laplace-transformed
   equation without using the special Airy function. A direct power series
   method and a power series method with variable changes to eliminate the
   advection term that usually results in numerical errors for large Peclet
   numbers are applied to obtain an analytical solution in the Laplace
   domain. The obtained solutions are compared to other Airy
   function-formed solutions to examine the method's robustness and
   accuracy. Analytical results indicate that the Laplace transform power
   series method with variable change can effectively and accurately handle
   the radial advection-dispersion equation of high Peclet numbers, whereas
   the direct power series method can only evaluate the solution for medium
   Peclet numbers. The novel power series technique with variable change is
   valuable for future quantitative hydrogeological issues with variable
   dependent differential equation and can be extended to higher
   dimensional problems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We propose to use regular monitoring data from a production or injection
   well for estimating the formation properties around the wellbore without
   interrupting the operations. Thus, instead of shutting-in the well for a
   substantial time period, we propose to select a portion of the pumping
   data over a certain time interval and then derive our conclusions from
   these data. A distinctive feature of our analysis is that we introduce
   an auxiliary parameter to account for the possible after-effects of
   pumping that preceded the test interval and, consequently, the
   non-uniform initial pressure conditions. We demonstrate that those
   effects influence not only the analysis of regular operations data, but
   also the analysis of a traditional pressure drawdown or pressure buildup
   test with a prior shut-in period. We show that phenomena usually
   attributed to wellbore storage or skin effects can be at least partially
   interpreted through the parameter we introduce. Unlike some traditional
   methods, our analysis utilizes almost the entire test time period for
   curve-fitting. It turns out that it produces good data matching even if
   the test period is short and the frequency of measurements is low.
   Another distinctive feature of the present approach is that the
   parameter estimation problem is reduced to a combination of quadratic
   criterion minimization and a search for the minimum of a one-variable
   function. Because we can obtain the solution to the quadratic problem
   analytically, we significantly simplify the problem and dramatically
   reduce the amount of computations required. (C) 2002 Published by

Abstract = {{A genetic algorithm is used here to guess-estimate a close-to-true set
   of trial values as input to a three-staged quasi-linear inverse modeling
   scheme for the determination of aquifer parameters. To validate the
   parameter determination, in addition to the conventional measures of
   misfit root mean squares (rms) and distribution, the aquifer thickness
   is treated as an unknown parameter and the model parameters are further
   evaluated by comparing the expected drawdown with the observed drawdown
   at wells which are not used for parameter determination (extrapolation
   fitting). The method is tested with synthetic and observed drawdown data
   from five partially screened monitoring wells in a water-table aquifer.
   Test results for synthetic data doped with random errors indicate that
   modeling based on two or more well data can yield satisfactory parameter
   values and extrapolation misfits in an ideal aquifer. For field data,
   the results indicate that a model misfit on par with the standard error
   of the data is achievable for each individual well or a combination of
   two wells but the extrapolation misfit distributions are generally
   biased and their rms are far greater-possibly due to aquifer
   heterogeneity. Consistent parameter values can be obtained from the
   geometric means for multiple runs of the genetic-inverse modeling of
   one-, two-, three-, and four-well data. Our test aquifer can be
   represented by a set of parameters with 10 to 15\% consistency,
   including transmissivity, storativity, vertical-to-horizontal
   conductivity ratio, and storativity-to-specific yield ratio, as affirmed
   by model aquifer thicknesses that deviate less than 10\% from the actual
   thickness. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{To understand the turbidity phenomenon that occurs during floodwater
   periods in the water of some karstic aquifers, a study was carried out
   on the Ain Asserdoune spring in the Beni Mellal Atlas. The application
   of correlation and spectral analyses to turbidity, rainfall and
   discharge rate with a daily sampling for three hydrological cycles
   showed that the Ain Asserdoune turbidity corresponded to the beginning
   of the unclogging of the karstic conduits affecting the saturated area.
   The appearance of turbidity during the increased flow rate was due to
   instability in the chaotic regime that was represented by suspended
   matter, which was evacuated independent of the discharge rate. This
   phenomenon only appears in polyphase karst, which is frequently found,
   and thus must be taken into account when karstic water is used for
   drinking as it could become unfit for human consumption. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Water stress is rapidly increasing in many Mediterranean coastal zones
   mainly due to expansion in agriculture and tourism. In this paper, we
   focus on the Sierra de Gador-Campo de Dalias aquifer system
   (southeastern Spain) in order to assess the capability of water stable
   isotope analysis (deltaD-delta(18)O) to refine the understanding on
   recharge of this karstic aquifer system. Different types of surface and
   groundwater were sampled along an altitudinal gradient from the recharge
   zone in the mountains to the coastal plain. Surface water is restricted
   to local runoff, collected in closed reservoirs. Runoff amounts,
   collected in three of these reservoirs were monitored together with the
   precipitation in their catchments. Meteorological maps were used to
   detect the origin of the precipitation generating the majority of the
   runoff. The results were compared to literature data on local and
   regional precipitation. The use of oxygen and hydrogen isotopic
   composition has proved to be a useful tool to explain the origin of
   groundwater in a Mediterranean karstic system. Such studies are,
   however, not numerous and are often limited to local scale recharge for
   fast-reacting systems. This paper focuses on the delta(18)O-deltaD
   relationships of local precipitation to explain the isotopic variability
   of a large karstic aquifer system. The isotopic compositions of
   groundwater sampled along an altitudinal gradient from the recharge zone
   to the coastal plain are well displayed, in a deltaD-delta(18)O diagram,
   on a mixing line connecting a pole of Mediterranean waters to a pole of
   Atlantic waters. The Atlantic signature predominates in the shallow
   groundwater of natural springs, reflecting the rainfall which produced
   the local runoff sampled. The Mediterranean signature is mainly
   restricted to deep groundwater from boreholes in the coastal plain. The
   existence of a degree of spatial separation of groundwater types
   demonstrates that groundwater flow in a complex karstic system is not
   always continuous. The Mediterranean signature of deep groundwater could
   be due to past extreme rainfall events during which connectivity between
   recharge and reservoir exists, while at the same time the Atlantic
   signature of recent winter rains dominates in shallow groundwater. The
   assumption that an equilibrium in isotopic composition is established
   within a continuous aquifer and that therefore a slope lower than 8 in a
   deltaD-delta(18)O diagram indicates evaporation is not necessarily
   valid. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of soil hydraulic behavior at large scales using
   traditional methods is time-consuming and very costly. Efficient and
   cheap means of providing hydrological models with such information are
   procedures based on pedotransfer functions (PTFs) that estimate soil
   hydraulic parameters from easily measurable or already available soil
   physical data. Major objectives of this study are to compare the
   prediction performance of some published PTFs and to improve their
   predictive capability by accounting for certain landscape variables,
   such as slope, aspect, and wetness index, for example. This additional
   information can be easily extracted from a digital elevation model of
   the area under study. While topographic attributes have shown potential
   for mapping soil properties over a region with higher precision and
   simplifying estimation of some model parameters, the challenge is also
   to examine whether, and to what extent, ancillary data of this kind can
   specifically contribute to improve the predictions of soil hydraulic
   characteristics. Since the most recent distributed hydrological models
   rely even more on an accurate representation of landscape features,
   improving PTFs with the inclusion of topographic variables is in line
   with this tendency. Statistical indices of goodness-of-fit are
   calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. It
   is shown, for example, that systematic biases in water retention
   predictions from an original PTF can be conveniently corrected by adding
   some primary or compound terrain attributes. The results confirm the
   role of terrain variables in assessing the spatial patterns of soil
   hydraulic characteristics. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We investigate (a) the submarine groundwater discharge (SGWD) defined as
   the net groundwater discharge to the sea and (b) the typical
   characteristics of the spatial distribution of the groundwater outflow
   at the sea bottom. The investigation concerns the Eckernforde Bay in the
   western Baltic Sea. A large-scale groundwater model was established in
   order to model groundwater flow toward the sea. Due to insufficient
   field data, different scenarios were simulated in order to approximate
   the value of SGWD. It is found that the probable range of SGWD in the
   study area per kilometer of the land-sea interface is from 0.05 to 0.07
   m(3)/s. The distribution of the groundwater outflow rates at two sea
   bottom sites (pockmarks) was investigated using two approaches. First,
   density effects were neglected. Under this condition, the resulting
   discharge distribution at one site is approximately uniform whereas at
   the other site it is strongly non-uniform with high outflow rates at the
   edges of the pockmark. These differences are due to different hydraulic
   conductivity distributions of the aquifer. Second, the investigation by
   means of a density-driven flow model shows that the main effect of the
   saltwater is to displace the groundwater outflow from the central part
   of the pockmark to its edges. The approximately uniform distribution
   estimated by neglecting the density effects does not reflect the
   conditions at the sea bottom whereas the strongly non-uniform
   distribution does. The strongly lion-uniform distribution of the outflow
   rates at the sea bottom indicates that locally measured outflow rates
   can hardly be used for the estimation of mean outflow rates over large
   parts of the sea bottom. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Cross-borehole flowmeter pulse tests define subsurface connections
   between discrete fractures using short stress periods to monitor the
   propagation of the pulse through the flow system. This technique is an
   improvement over other cross-borehole techniques because measurements
   can be made in open boreholes without packers or previous identification
   of water-producing intervals. The method is based on the concept of
   monitoring the propagation of pulses rather than steady flow through the
   fracture network. In this method, a hydraulic stress is applied to a
   borehole connected to a single, permeable fracture, and the distribution
   of flow induced by that stress monitored in adjacent boreholes. The
   transient flow responses are compared to type curves computed for
   several different types of fracture connections. The shape of the
   transient flow response indicates the type of fracture connection, and
   the fit of the data to the type curve yields an estimate of its
   transmissivity and storage coefficient. The flowmeter pulse test
   technique was applied in fractured shale at a volatile-organic
   contaminant plume in Watervliet, New York. Flowmeter and other
   geophysical logs were used to identify permeable fractures in eight
   boreholes in and near the contaminant plume using single-borehole flow
   measurements. Flowmeter cross-hole pulse tests were used to identify
   connections between fractures detected in the boreholes. The results
   indicated a permeable fracture network connecting many of the individual
   boreholes, and demonstrated the presence of an ambient upward
   hydraulic-head gradient throughout the site.}},

Abstract = {{Use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is becoming increasingly common
   in the analysis of groundwater hydrology and water resources problems.
   In this research, an ANN was developed and used to estimate aquifer
   parameter values, namely transmissivity and storage coefficient, from
   pumping test data for a large diameter well. The ANN was trained to map
   time-drawdown and well diameter data (input vector) to its corresponding
   transmissivity and storage coefficient values (output vector). Based
   upon a pre-specified range of aquifer parameters, the input vectors were
   generated from the analytical solution of Papadopulos and Copper for
   large diameter well in a homogeneous, isotropic, non-leaky confined
   aquifer. The ANN was trained with a fixed number of drawdown data points
   corresponding to a varying pre-specified range of aquifer parameters and
   time-series values. Once the network is trained to an acceptable level
   of accuracy, it produces an output of aquifer parameter values for any
   input vector. The results obtained with the ANN are in good agreement
   with published values. A significant advantage of the ANN approach is
   that it overcomes the problem of determining the storage coefficient,
   which when determined by traditional type curve matching method is of
   questionable reliability. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Soil saturation is known to be of crucial importance, to denitrification
   and other nitrogen cycling processes within the riparian zone. Since
   denitrification potential generally increases towards the soil surface,
   water table elevation can control the degree to which nitrate reduction
   is optimised. Given their topographic location and sedimentary
   structure, most floodplains are characterised by high water tables.
   However, detailed field data on water table levels, hydraulic gradients
   and flow patterns within the riparian zone are generally lacking. This
   paper presents data collected as part of a pan-European study of nitrate
   buffer zones, the Nitrogen Control by Landscape Structures in
   Agricultural Environments project (NICOLAS). An identical experimental
   design was employed at each site, allowing riparian zone hydrology and
   nitrogen cycling processes to be explored across a wide range of
   temperate climates; only the hydrological data are discussed here. A
   grid of dipwells at 10-metre spacing was installed at each site and
   manual measurements made at least once a month for a minimum of one
   year. In addition, at least one dipwell in each grid was monitored
   continuously using a data logger. All the riparian zones studied
   displayed a clear annual cycle of water table elevation, although other
   factors seemed equally important in influencing the range of variation.
   Where the riparian zone was flat, the water level in the adjoining river
   or lake proved more significant in controlling water table levels within
   the riparian zone than was originally anticipated. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Severe flooding in the Meramec River basin followed an extraordinary
   rainfall event on May 7, 2000. Precipitation measurements for the 13-h
   event ranged from 12.7 to 39.9 cm over a 4100 km(2) region centered near
   Union, Missouri. Sample collections for isotopic and chemical analyses
   and field measurements of water temperature, specific conductivity,
   turbidity, and pH were made from three rivers during the course of the
   event. Relative to pre-storm values, flood water underwent a three to
   10-fold decrease in conductivity, a 100-fold or more increase in
   turbidity, and pH fluctuations over a range of 1.0 unit. Concentration
   of major ions varied inversely (Ca, Mg, Na, Cl, SO4) or directly (K)
   proportional to discharge.
   Oxygen isotope measurements were used to separate each discharge
   hydrograph into pre-event and event water components. Event water
   dominated during peak runoff on each of the rivers, a condition atypical
   of floodwaters in this region and the result of overland flow or rapid
   subsurface delivery of precipitation. The Bourbeuse River showed the
   largest event water component during this exceptional event, with storm
   water making up essentially 100\% of the flow for more than 24 h. (C)

Abstract = {{Available energy (often expressed in terms of potential evaporation) and
   precipitation largely determine annual evapotranspiration and runoff
   rates in a region. The ratio of annual potential evaporation to
   precipitation, referred to as the aridity index by Budyko, has been
   shown to describe the evaporation ratio (the ratio of annual
   evapotranspiration to precipitation) of catchments from a range of
   climatic regimes in a number of studies. It has been shown that aridity
   index alone can be used to obtain an estimate of ratio of standard
   deviation of annual evapotranspiration estimates to that of
   precipitation (the evaporation deviation ratio). At present, there are
   at least five functional forms available, which describe evaporation
   ratio as a function of aridity index. This study assesses data from
   Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis' (CCCma)
   third-generation atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) against
   these five functional forms. Evaporation ratio and evaporation deviation
   ratios from an AGCM simulation are compared against these five
   functional forms and it is shown that the primary control of available
   energy and precipitation over annual partitioning of precipitation, and
   interannual variability of evapotranspiration, is preserved well in the
   AGCM. The aridity index is further used to obtain an analytic equation,
   which can be used to estimate change in runoff given annual changes in
   precipitation and available energy. This equation is validated using
   data from control and climate change simulations of the CCCma coupled
   GCM (CGCM1) and shown to perform fairly well. The correlation between
   CGCM1 simulated annual change in runoff and the values obtained using
   aridity index is consistently around 0.95, and the average bias varies
   between 40.5 and 50.3 mm/year, for the five functional forms. The
   successful validation of this equation against data from a GCM climate
   change simulation illustrates the continued relevance of aridity index,
   and the primary control of precipitation and available energy in
   determining annual evapotranspiration and runoff rates. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{Hydrologic response patterns of three ground treatments (resident
   vegetation, bare soil and ripped resident vegetation) were investigated.
   An in situ, micro-scale, plot retention-tank system was employed and
   used in conjunction with a kinematic wave model {[}Seasonal changes in
   infiltration and soil water storage in conventional and alternative
   agricultural systems, MS Thesis, University of California, Davis (2000)]
   to calculate surface water runoff hydrographs via the orchard
   floor-specific infiltration function. The model optimized Green and
   Ampt's infiltration function on the suction at the wetting front until
   the endpoint of the cumulative runoff hydrograph matched observed runoff
   volumes. Our approach aimed to minimize data collection in the field and
   was found useful in the evaluation of different ground treatments as
   well as in evaluating their ability to reduce runoff under dry and
   wetted conditions. Infiltration for ripped resident vegetation was
   approximately an order of magnitude greater than that for bare soil.
   Resident vegetation yielded intermediate results. However, under
   elevated soil water conditions (degree of saturation greater than 0.80),
   differences between response patterns of resident vegetation and bare
   soil markedly decreased. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A sound understanding of solute transport under stormflow conditions is
   crucial for assessing groundwater and stream water contamination risk.
   The vadoze zone exhibits its maximum protective effect, when solute
   transport occurs via translatory flow. In contrast, short-term hydraulic
   short circuits via preferential flow can have considerable harmful
   effects on water quality.
   The Lehstenbach study combines comprehensive physical and hydrochemical
   measurements that allow improved understanding of the short-term stream
   discharge and groundwater recharge dynamics. The data set covers the
   1998 catchment wetting-up period, including the second to highest
   discharge peak, since measurements began in 1987. During that storm, the
   pressure wave reached 0.9 m depth within 2 h, preceding the discharge
   peak by another 2 h. In contrast, shallow groundwater response at 3 m
   depth was delayed considerably.
   Soil hydrometric data and temperature, aluminum, sulfate, and dissolved
   organic carbon dynamics in stream water and groundwater indicated
   translatory flow during groundwater recharge and stormflow runoff
   generation. In contrast, the observed decline in silica concentration of
   groundwater and stream water provided strong evidence that seepage flux
   was restricted to a small fraction of the total soil water pool.
   Exchange with the matrix was limited by the slow kinetics of silica
   dissolution, while sulfate and aluminum kinetics are quite rapid, and
   this feature explains the apparent discrepancy between silica, sulfate,
   and aluminum data.
   The results emphasize that preferential flow phenomena are not so much
   due to inherent properties of the soil matrix as depending on the scale
   of observation and the observed parameters and their kinetics of
   equilibrating with the matrix during subsurface transport. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The efficient method presented herein is based on the regularity of
   water flow in an open channel, which is maintained by nature at a
   constant ratio of mean to maximum velocities at a channel section. This
   ratio is a function of a parameter of a probability distribution that is
   equivalent to velocity distribution in the physical space. The maximum
   velocity can be determined quickly by measuring only a few velocities
   from a single vertical axis. As well as the ratio, the location of the
   sampling vertical axis on which the maximum velocity occurs tends to
   remain invariant with time. The mean velocity in a section can be
   rapidly determined by estimating the product of the maximum velocity
   multiplied by the ratio. The cross-sectional area of an open channel can
   be determined by the relation between gage height and area. Thus, the
   discharge in an open channel may be estimated as the product of mean
   velocity multiplied by the cross-sectional area. This efficient method
   can be used with any current meter to reduce the time and cost of
   discharge measurement in open channel flows under tidal effect. The
   available data of the Tanshui River downstream reach of which is in an

Abstract = {{The use of two non-linear black-box approaches, phase-space
   reconstruction (PSR) and artificial neural networks (ANN), for
   forecasting river flow dynamics is studied and a comparison of their
   performances is made. This is done by attempting 1-day and 7-day ahead
   forecasts of the daily river flow from the Nakhon Sawan station at the
   Chao Phraya River basin in Thailand. The results indicate a reasonably
   good performance of both approaches for both 1-day and 7-day ahead
   forecasts. However, the performance of the PSR approach is found to be
   consistently better than that of ANN. One reason for this could be that
   in the PSR approach the flow series in the phase-space is represented
   step by step in local neighborhoods, rather than a global approximation
   as is done in ANN. Another reason could be the use of the multi-layer
   perceptron (MLP) in ANN, since MLPs may not be most appropriate for
   forecasting at longer lead times. The selection of training set for the
   ANN may also contribute to such results. A comparison of the optimal
   number of variables for capturing the flow dynamics, as identified by
   the two approaches, indicates a large discrepancy in the case of 7-day
   ahead forecasts (1 and 7 variables, respectively), though for 1-day
   ahead forecasts it is found to be consistent (3 variables). A possible
   explanation for this could be the influence of noise in the data, an
   observation also made from the 1-day ahead forecast results using the
   PSR approach. The present results lead to observation on: (1) the use of
   other neural networks for runoff forecasting, particularly at longer
   lead times; (2) the influence of training set used in the ANN; and (3)
   the effect of noise on forecast accuracy, particularly in the PSR
   approach. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Box-Cox transformation is widely used to transform hydrological data
   to make it approximately Gaussian. Bayesian evaluation of parameter
   uncertainty in stochastic models using the Box-Cox transformation is
   hindered by the fact that there is no analytical solution for the
   posterior distribution. However, the Markov chain Monte Carlo method
   known as the Metropolis algorithm can be used to simulate the posterior
   distribution. This method properly accounts for the nonnegativity
   constraint implicit in the Box-Cox transformation. Nonetheless, a case
   study using the AR(1) model uncovered a practical problem with the
   implementation of the Metropolis algorithm. The use of a multivariate
   Gaussian jump distribution resulted in unacceptable convergence
   behaviour. This was rectified by developing suitable parameter
   transformations for the mean and variance of the AR(1) process to remove
   the strong nonlinear dependencies with the Box-Cox transformation
   parameter. Applying this methodology to the Sydney annual rainfall data
   and the Burdekin River annual runoff data illustrates the efficacy of
   these parameter transformations and demonstrate the value of quantifying
   parameter uncertainty. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The utility of hydrological models as a research tool is strongly linked
   to their ability to capture changes in regional hydrologic regimes in
   response to changes in climate forcing, or to simulate the hydrologic
   regimes of distinct climatic regions: that is, model transferability. To
   assess the transferability of an existing land-surface hydrology model
   (LSHM), three case-studies were conducted without changing the model's
   physical parameterizations and without the calibration of model
   parameters. A 1D implementation of the LSHM was used with data sets from
   Cabauw in the Netherlands (field plot scale, one year), and from Valdai
   in Russia (small catchment scale, 18 years). Simulations of runoff,
   latent and sensible heat fluxes, soil moisture and soil temperature, and
   snow accumulation and melt were compared against observations at hourly,
   daily, monthly, annual and inter-annual time scales. The model can
   reproduce well the monthly, seasonal and interannual variability of the
   hydrological regime in response to applied forcing, especially regarding
   snow accumulation patterns, and the timing and duration of melting. The
   results also show that, where shallow watertable fluctuations are
   important in determining the mechanisms of runoff generation (i.e.
   Valdai), the dynamic interaction between the saturated and the
   unsaturated zones is an essential hydrologic process that cannot be
   ignored. Continental-scale simulations were performed using a
   1degreesx1degrees global data set to assess the model's ability to
   capture seasonal cycles and interannual variability of hydrological
   variables across diverse climatic regions in the continental USA before
   and during the 1988 drought. The results obtained for the three
   case-studies suggest that the model can be used to study the range of
   variability caused by environmental change on mid-latitude hydrological
   regimes. Further work must be conducted for and and semiarid regions.

Abstract = {{Collapse sinkholes are found in groundwater recharge zones throughout
   the world. They cause substantial loss of property each year, and
   occasional fatalities. In such settings, the formation of these features
   occurs through the downward migration of regolith into karst voids. The
   presence of a void in the bedrock. and sufficient seepage pressure or
   gravitative force in the regolith, is required for their creation. We
   investigated the development of cover collapse sinkholes in an unusual
   setting, areas of groundwater discharge rather than recharge. Upward
   hydraulic gradients and the likelihood of groundwater saturated with
   respect to calcite are difficult to reconcile with standard models for
   collapse development. Short flowpaths or renewed groundwater
   aggressivity towards calcite (via mischungskorrosion, thermally driven
   circulation, or deep-seated gaseous sources) are hypothetical mechanisms
   that could generate the subsurface voids that are needed to allow cover
   collapse development in discharge areas. For the two field sites in
   central Italy that we investigated, calculated carbon dioxide partial
   pressures in springs ranged from 7.38 X 10(-2) to 7.29 X 10(-1) atm.
   This indicates that deep-seated gaseous sources are most likely the
   mechanism allowing the development of the sinkholes. Groundwater is
   recharged in surrounding limestone massifs. The water moves through the
   carbonates and becomes saturated with calcite. As it circulates deeply
   in to the adjacent valleys, it mixes with deep-seated waters and gaseous
   fluxes from major fault systems, acquiring renewed aggressivity towards
   calcite. Finally, the water ascends into confined aquifers in the valley
   fill, and dissolves carbonate material present within, leading to
   surface collapse. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Identification of processes affecting stream chloride response in the

Abstract = {{Early hydrochemical catchment models, assuming chloride to be
   hydrologically and chemically inert. failed to reproduce observed damped
   stream chloride responses to highly variable rainfall inputs. To explain
   this, the presence of a large volume hydrological store within the
   catchment has been inferred, although this is generally unobservable,
   and unidentifiable from hydrological modelling studies. However, there
   is increasing awareness of a range of physical. chemical and biological
   processes which can affect chloride transport. These include the
   biogeochemical cycling of chloride in soil, a significant chloride
   adsorption capacity of some organic soils and diffusive transfers
   between mobile and immobile soil waters which can give rise to a similar
   `adsorption' response. There is therefore a need to evaluate the
   importance of non-conservative adsorption processes in observed stream
   chloride response. This issue is addressed here via the calibration and
   structural assessment of a specially developed model using stream
   chloride data from the Hafren catchment, mid-Wales. The major
   conclusions are that the non-conservative model produces improved
   simulation of stream chloride in comparison with a conservative model.
   This is not an artefact of the increased complexity of the
   non-conservative model; the assumption of a large chloride reservoir is
   structurally invalid for long-term prediction. Adsorption, or
   adsorption-like processes thus appear to play a dominant role in
   influencing stream chloride. These findings have important and
   wide-ranging consequences for hydrological process studies. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Remotely sensed precipitation from METEOSAT data and leaf area index
   (LAI) from NOAA AVHRR data is used as input data to the distributed
   hydrological modelling of three sub catchments (82.000 km(2)) in the
   Senegal River Basin. Further, root depths of annual vegetation are
   related to the temporal and spatial variation of LAI. The modelling
   results are compared with results based on conventional input of
   precipitation and vegetation characteristics. The introduction of
   remotely sensed LAI shows improvements in the simulated hydrographs, a
   marked change in the relative proportions of actual evapotranspiration
   comprising canopy evaporation, soil evaporation and transpiration. while
   no clear trend in the spatial pattern could be found, The remotely
   sensed precipitation resulted in similar model performances with respect
   to the simulated hydrographs as with the conventional raingauge input. A
   simple merging of the two inputs did not result in any improvement. (C)

Abstract = {{The Issaquah Creek watershed is a rapidly urbanizing watershed of 144
   km(2) in western Washington, where sediment aggradation of the main
   channel and delivery of fine sediment into a large downstream lake have
   raised increasingly frequent concerns over flooding, loss of fish
   habitat, and degraded water quality. A watershed-scale sediment budget
   was evaluated to determine the relative effects of land-use practices,
   including urbanization, on sediment supply and delivery, and to guide
   management responses towards the most effective source-reduction
   strategies. Human activity in the watershed, particularly urban
   development, has caused an increase of nearly 50\% in the annual
   sediment yield, now estimated to be 44 tonnes km(-2) yr(-1). The main
   sources of sediment in the watershed are landslides (50\%), channel-bank
   erosion (20\%), and road-surface erosion (15\%). This assessment
   characterizes the role of human activity in mixed-use watersheds such as
   this, and it demonstrates some of the key processes, particularly
   enhanced stream-channel erosion, by which urban development alters
   sediment loads. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Seepage from a stream, which partially penetrates an unconfined alluvial
   aquifer, is studied for the case when the water table falls below the
   streambed level, Inadequacies are identified in current modelling
   approaches to this situation. A simple and improved method of
   incorporating such seepage into groundwater models is presented. This
   considers the effect on seepage flow of suction in the unsaturated part
   of the aquifer below a disconnected stream and allows for the variation
   of seepage with water table fluctuations, The suggested technique is
   incorporated into the saturated code MODFLOW and is tested by comparing
   its predictions with those of a widely used variably saturated model,
   SWMS\_2D simulating water flow and solute transport in two-dimensional
   variably saturated media. Comparisons are made of both seepage flows and
   local mounding of the water table. The suggested technique compares very
   well with the results of variably saturated model simulations. Most
   currently used approaches are shown to underestimate the seepage and
   associated local water table mounding, sometimes substantially. The
   proposed method is simple, easy to implement and requires only a small
   amount of additional data about the aquifer hydraulic properties. (C)

Title = {{Sensitivity of computed values of water balance and nitrate leaching to
   within soil class variability of transport parameters}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{264}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{87-100}},

Abstract = {{Variability with respect to model input data is recognised as a
   potential source of uncertainty in model predictions. The aim of this
   study is to estimate the sensitivity of computed values of water balance
   terms, in particular drainage below the root zone of crops, and that of
   nitrate leaching, to variability of soil transport parameters within a
   soil class, and to quantify the domains of sensitivity as a function of
   soil type, The methodological framework is based on the concept of Areal
   Non-Point Source Watershed Environmental Response Simulation, coupled
   with a Latin Hypercube Sampler, to obtain a stochastic model. Two
   applications are considered. First, a case study is made of the
   experimental catchment of LaCote St Andre, predominantly a loam soil,
   where intensive experimentation has been carried out from 1991 to 1995.
   Second, a generalisation to different types of soil is carried out.
   It is shown that for this model within-class variability has no effect
   in long-term simulations for soils with saturated hydraulic conductivity
   K, higher than 100 min/day. For these soils. the concept of
   representative elementary area is fully acceptable and convenient.
   Corresponding soil classes can each be described by a single set of
   parameters (the barycentre (centroid) of the class) with a very small
   loss of information compared to a very important gain in terms of input
   data requirements and simulation time. This has important consequences
   for large-scale distributed models, since it reduces considerably the
   number of measurements necessary to describe the soil; in particular
   there may be no need, in this range, to account for spatial variability
   of textural parameters within a class.
   In contrast, within-class variability of transport parameters becomes an
   important source of uncertainty for soil classes below this threshold
   value of saturated hydraulic conductivity. An estimation of errors
   resulting from aggregation of transport parameters values to those
   corresponding to the centroid of the soil class is given. These errors
   are obviously dependent on K, values and rainfall intensity. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The amount of information available to run a spatially distributed model
   is often very much less than the ideal. The aim of this study is to
   estimate the impact of degradation of information about the spatial
   distribution of input parameters, and second the scale at which this
   information is obtained.
   A well defined agricultural catchment, with an important database
   concerning spatial and temporal observations has been used for this
   purpose: the agricultural catchment of la Cote St Andre, 60 km North
   East of Grenoble in the South East of France. The methodological
   framework is based on the Areal Non-point Source Watershed Environmental
   Response Simulation model.
   A 3 year simulation using georeferenced variables (crops and soil types)
   and annual changes in crop rotation is first developed as a reference.
   This is compared to simulations results obtained during the same period,
   with the same climatic data, but with the following degradation of
   quality of other inputs: firstly, the spatial distribution of soils and
   crop is ignored; both variables being defined by their areal coverage
   obtained from local information; secondly, the same inputs are deduced
   from a database obtained at the European scale. In both cases, a Latin
   Hypercube Sampler is used to stochastically generate sets of samples
   corresponding to the probability distribution of variables. The study is
   based on comparisons between modelled outputs: drainage of water and
   leaching of nitrate below the root zone of crops at the catchment scale.
   When information is local, and in absence of lateral flow (runoff),
   distributed modelling and purely stochastic modelling provide identical
   catchment average values; on the contrary, the use of the European
   database may introduce important biases concerning the proportion of
   land uses and of soils. In both cases, however, the lack of information
   concerning the location of sensitive areas in terms of risks of
   pollution may be considered as an important weakness of stochastic
   models.

Abstract = {{The Muskingum unsteady flow routing method is well established in the
   hydrological literature and its modest data requirements make it
   attractive for practical use. Muskingum routing is based on an assumed
   power relationship between channel storage and river stage, and
   consequently, it accounts for channel storage only and not bank storage.
   Routing parameters in the models are usually derived by calibration
   using measured discharge hydrographs. Bank storage is, therefore,
   implicitly accounted for, together with channel storage, but this may
   result in unrealistic parameter values. In this paper, Muskingum
   procedures are modified to explicitly account for the interaction
   between channel flow and bank storage in rivers with permeable river
   banks of varying hydraulic conductivity. The approach is verified by
   resynthesising a rating function used in rigorous routing in a
   hypothetical channel with permeable banks. The method is also applied to
   determine routing parameters for a reach along the Sabie River in South
   Africa by explicitly accounting for bank storage. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{One hundred years chronological water level fluctuations for Chapala
   Lake, a shallow tropical lake in west Mexico, as well as their
   relationships with air temperature fluctuations, precipitation and Lerma
   River discharge are examined in this study. It is shown, that these
   relationships were strongly revealed in the last 1997-98 El Nino, which
   caused anomalous air temperature and evaporation increase throughout
   Western Mexico territory and, as a consequence, I m downturn of the
   Chapala lake level since January till June, 1998. To investigate
   1997-1998 El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO 1997-98)
   AVHRR-NOAA satellite image analysis of the Chapala Lake surface water
   temperature (LCST) was performed. These images provide a temperature
   database for 1996-99 (38 months). Analysis of annual and seasonal LCST
   fluctuations was carried out using monthly averages for this period.
   Time series analysis on the LCST data suggest that seasonal surface
   temperature variations may be almost completely obscured by the annual
   harmonic. In 1998 the temperature pattern was altered due to the El Nino
   1997-98 episode. In winter the water surface temperature was on average
   almost 1 degreesC lower than the temperature values registered in 1996.
   However, for the summer and autumn of 1998, such temperatures were 1.5
   degrees? higher in comparison with the reference year of 1996. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The chemical behavior of major inorganic ions in the streams of the
   Mankyung River area (South Korea) was investigated. Mixing with effluent
   from the Jeonju STP (a municipal sewage treatment plant in Jeonju City)
   was the most important process in regulating the water chemistry of the
   streams. The effluent was chemically distinct relative to the stream
   waters in inorganic composition. Behavior of various ions was evaluated
   by comparing their concentrations with the concentration of chloride, a
   conservative chemical species. It was revealed that concentrations of
   chloride and sulfate, the total concentration of major cations, and
   electrical conductivity in the stream were controlled only by mixing,
   indicating their conservative behavior similar to chloride. Alkalinity
   and concentration of nitrate, however, were regulated by various
   reactions such as mixing, photosynthesis, respiration, and decomposition
   of organic matter, Streamflows were estimated by observing chemical
   composition of the effluent and those of up/downstream waters. Estimated
   flows based on the conservative chemical parameters were nearly the same
   as those directly measured using an area-velocity method, indicating the
   validity of the chemistry-based method. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Forty years of winter precipitation (23 stations) and spring stream flow
   discharge records (five stations) from across Idaho are analyzed to
   reveal regional patterns of association with sea surface temperatures
   (SSTs) in the Pacific Ocean. Results indicate that winter precipitation
   in the northern Idaho mountains, between 45degrees and 48degreesN, is
   negatively correlated with fall SSTs in the eastern tropical Pacific
   Ocean (El Nino and La Nina). Winter precipitation north of 45degreesN,
   is negatively correlated with winter SSTs in the northern Pacific
   (Pacific Decadal Oscillation, PDO). Spring stream discharge in Idaho is
   also negatively correlated with SSTs in the eastern tropical and
   northern regions of the Pacific Ocean.
   The association is asymmetric with stronger responses during negative
   SSTs for both regions in the Pacific Ocean. Wet and dry conditions are
   most likely associated with the combination of La Nina-negative PDO and
   El Nino-positive PDO, respectively. The greatest anomalies occur during
   the optimal combination of La Nina with negative PDO conditions, The
   revealed connections are valuable for climatic predictions based on the
   previous season's SST conditions in the eastern tropical Pacific and
   slowly evolving SSTs in the northern Pacific Ocean. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Stable isotopes of precipitation, ground water and surface water
   measured on the windward side of East Maui from 0 to 3055 m altitude
   were used to determine recharge sources for stream flow and ground
   water. Correct interpretation of the hydrology using rainfall delta(18)O
   gradients with altitude required consideration of the influence of fog,
   as fog samples had isotopic signatures enriched by as much as 3parts per
   thousand in delta(18)D and 21parts per thousand in deltaD compared to
   volume-weighted average precipitation at the same altitude. The isotopic
   analyses suggested that fog drip was a major component of stream flow
   and shallow ground water at higher altitudes in the watershed.
   O-18/altitude gradients in rainfall were comparable for similar
   microclimates on Maui (this study) and Hawaii Island (1990-1995 study),
   however, East Maui delta(18)O values for rain in trade-wind and
   high-altitude microclimates were enriched compared to those from Hawaii
   Island. Isotopes were used to interpret regional hydrology in this
   volcanic island aquifer system. In part of the study area, stable
   isotopes indicate discharge of ground water recharged at least 1000 m
   above the sample site. This deep-flowpath ground water was found in
   springs from sea level up to 240 m altitude, indicating saturation to
   altitudes much higher than a typical freshwater lens. These findings
   help in predicting the effects of ground water development on stream
   flow in the area. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Field-scale transport of reactive solutes depends on spatially variable
   physical and chemical soil properties. The quantitative importance of
   physical and chemical parameters required for the prediction of the
   field-scale solute flux is generally unknown. A sensitivity analysis is
   presented that ranks the importance of spatially variable water flow and
   solute transport parameters affecting field-scale cadmium flux in a
   layered sandy soil. In a Monte-Carlo simulation approach, partial rank
   correlation coefficients were calculated between model parameters and
   cadmium flux concentrations at various time steps. Data on the
   heterogeneity of flow and transport parameters were obtained from a 180
   m-long and 1 m-deep Spodosol transect. Each soil layer was described in
   terms of probability density functions of five model parameters: two
   shape parameters of van Genuchten's water retention curve. saturated
   hydraulic conductivity, dispersivity and soil-water distribution
   coefficient. The results showed that the cadmium flux concentrations at
   the bottom of the soil profile were most sensitive to the cadmium
   deposition rate and the soil-water distribution coefficient of all soil
   horizons. The maximum cadmium flux concentrations were also affected by
   variations in hydraulic conductivity of the humic topsoil horizons.
   Variations in shape parameters of the water retention curve did not
   significantly affect the field-scale cadmium flux. Variations in the
   dispersivity of the subsoil significantly influenced the early time
   cadmium concentrations. Monte-Carlo simulations involving non-linear
   sorption showed that cadmium flux concentrations were dominated by
   variations in the sorption constant and in the exponent of the
   Freundlich isotherm. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Net below canopy fluxes in Canarian laurel forest canopies}},

Abstract = {{Bulk precipitation, stemflow and throughfall were collected in a
   Canarian laurel forest (North Tenerife), and chemically analysed to
   determine the net below canopy fluxes. Annual negative fluxes were found
   for H+, NO3, SO4- and Cl- and annual positive fluxes for Ca2+, Mg2+, K+,
   Na+, HCO3-, PO43- and DOC. Negative fluxes for most of these ions have
   been reported previously but this is the first time that they have all
   been measured at the same time in one forest.
   The relative importance of atmospheric deposition and canopy leaching to
   net below canopy fluxes was evaluated using two approaches previously
   employed in this type of study. The first approach consisted of
   calculating total inputs, taking inputs as bulk precipitation or bulk
   precipitation plus the additional input from scavenging dry deposition
   by vegetation surfaces, corrected by the maximum and minimum leaching
   rate. The values obtained for inputs were very similar, possibly due to
   the minimum effect on scavenging particles by the canopy. In the second
   approach, linear regressions were developed for net below canopy fluxes
   and the variables related to dry deposition (antecedent dry period) and
   leaching (event quantity and duration, etc.); this showed that NO3- in
   net below canopy fluxes came from dry deposition, the rest of the
   elements from leaching, and SO42- from both. Similar results were
   obtained using both approaches.
   It was found that a simple linear regression model with event quantity
   as the independent variable can readily substitute the Lovett and
   Lindberg (1984) {[}J. Appl, Ecol. 21 (1984) 1013] model. The latter
   model was applied for separate internal and external sources in the case
   of SO42-.
   This forest differed greatly from other, previously studied forests.
   Large amounts of water were required for a positive flux (leaching),
   suggesting that the negative net below canopy fluxes of some elements
   were due to the low water regimes during the study year. Possible causes
   of this were the high value of the canopy saturation and the pattern of
   scattered rainfall, which led to extreme values of interception losses.
   The point at which the line representing the relationship between net
   below canopy fluxes and event quantity intersected the x axis varied
   depending on the leachable properties of the canopy ions. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The influence of artificial dead zones, such as groyne fields, on the
   transport of a spill in a river has been analysed. For this purpose,
   tracer experiments executed in the Dutch Rhine branches in the framework
   of the development of the Rhine Alarm-Model were used. Additionally for
   low water discharges with a suppressed flow in the Lower-Rhine River,
   measured concentration distributions of a few accidental spills were
   considered. In the Rhine Alarm-Model a lag coefficient applied to the
   convective transport of a spill represents the influence of the groyne
   fields. In the case of a complete exchange of the groyne field with the
   main stream, this coefficient is equal to the ratio between the
   cross-sectional areas of the groyne field and the main stream of the
   river. It is shown that this is correct to a certain extent for the
   Dutch Rhine branches Waal and Lower Rhine. However, in the case of low
   water discharges the influence of the groyne fields can reduce
   considerably. To explain these reductions, fundamental research of the
   mass exchange processes between groyne fields and main stream is needed.

Abstract = {{The continuing and increased use of renewable energy sources, including
   hydropower, is a key strategy to limit the extent of future climate
   change. Paradoxically, climate change itself may alter the availability
   of this natural resource, adversely affecting the financial viability of
   both existing and potential schemes. Here. a model is described that
   enables the assessment of the relationship between changes in climate
   and the viability, technical and financial, of hydro development. The
   planned Batoka Gorge scheme on the Zambezi River is used as a case study
   to validate the model and to predict the impact of climate change on
   river flows, electricity production and scheme financial performance.
   The model was found to perform well, given the inherent difficulties in
   the task, although there is concern regarding the ability of the
   hydrological model to reproduce the historic flow conditions of the
   upper Zambezi Basin. Simulations with climate change scenarios
   illustrate the sensitivity of the Batoka Gorge scheme to changes in
   climate. They suggest significant reductions in river flows, declining
   power production. reductions in electricity sales revenue and
   consequently an adverse impact on a range of investment measures. (C)

Abstract = {{Shallow lakes in a continental. low Arctic setting are found to undergo
   substantial fluctuations in heavy-isotope content during the annual
   cycle due to extreme seasonality in water balance processes. Progressive
   isotope enrichment during the ice-free period occurs as a consequence of
   isotope exchange during evaporation under seasonally arid conditions,
   while enhanced input and flushing by heavy-isotope depleted
   precipitation and snowmelt during late fall and spring tend to deplete
   the lakes in heavy isotopes once again. Time-series sampling surveys in
   a group of nearby lakes, ranging in volume from 41,000 to 2,250,000
   m(3), was carried out for two consecutive ice-free periods, in
   conjunction with a comprehensive hydrological measurement program in a
   detailed study lake, to assess models that describe isotopic enrichment
   in lakes and to test their suitability for comparing evaporation rates
   and water balance. From a non-steady isotope balance analysis, it is
   found that isotope enrichment rates in lakes during the ice-free period
   are determined primarily by evaporation rates and volume of the lakes,
   and are less sensitive to water balance variations for short time
   intervals when evaporation is less than 50 mm or so. A basic assessment
   of best-fit and step-wise models is presented which suggests that the
   former are useful only for predicting evaporation and water balance
   during month-long periods with relatively stable atmospheric and
   hydrologic conditions. A step-wise isotope balance approach is presented
   which demonstrates how isotope-based estimates of evaporation rates can
   be applied to effectively compare short-term (weekly) water balance in
   nearby lakes. Practical applications in the region include water balance
   assessments to assist in design and maintenance of tailings ponds for
   gold and diamond mining operations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   realizations, and show individual results for selected cases to
   highlight key features of flow and transport through hierarchically
   fractured rock. These studies are intended to illustrate the range of
   possible behavior that can be obtained during fracture-dominated
   hydraulic and tracer tests. and provide insights into how to interpret
   field responses. The fractal dimension of the fracture network itself is
   generally larger than the fractal dimension of the flow field arising
   during a well test. The performance measures of the natural-gradient
   tracer tests. including the total flow through the fracture network,
   tracer travel time, front width, and maximum breakthrough concentration,
   can all be con-elated to fractal dimension. Although some of the
   features observed in the flow and transport behavior within the
   hierarchically fractured rock have been observed by other authors using
   non-fractal fracture network concepts (e.g. channelized flow with early
   breakthrough times, crossing breakthrough curves), others arise directly
   from the fractal nature of the fracture network, in which variability
   occurs on all scales (e.g. front width and maximum breakthrough
   concentration that are constant over a wide range of fractal
   dimensions). Generally, transport simulations show large variability
   within a given realization and among realizations with the same fractal
   dimension, even in networks whose dimension is close to two. This
   finding is consistent with the large variability in experimental results
   observed at fractured rock field sites. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{We constructed a hydrologic model to estimate the groundwater recharge
   rate for alluvial aquifers of the Eastern Desert from sporadic
   precipitation over the Red Sea hills. To estimate initial losses over
   sub-basins, transmission losses through channel routing, and downstream
   runoff, we developed an integrated model combining spatial rainfall
   distribution, ail appropriate basin unit hydrograph. and appropriate
   infiltration parameters. Watersheds and stream networks identified from
   digital terrain elevation data were verified by comparison with
   co-registered Landsat thematic mapper scenes and geologic maps. Records
   of a November 1994 storm event acquired from rain gauges along the Nile
   River and the Red Sea shore were used to generate a spatial
   precipitation distribution for the study area, A 2 hour design
   hyetograph was adopted from rain gauge data for the 1994 flood event.
   The model was tested against records from the November 1994 flood event
   at the outlets of the Tarfa and Hammamat watersheds.
   Groundwater recharge rates were estimated for the alluvial aquifers
   within the major watersheds of the north Eastern Desert. We estimated
   that during the 1994 flood event. the ground water recharge through
   transmission losses ranged from 2 1 to 3 1 (Tarfa: 15.8 X 10(6) m(3):
   Asyuti: 20 X 10(6) m(3). Qena: 49 X 10(6) m(3), Hammamat: 59 X 10(6)
   m(3)) of the precipitated volume. The initial losses ranged from 65 to
   77\% Only 3-7\% of the precipitation reached the watershed outlets,
   Archival data show that rainfall events of the size of the November 1994
   storm or larger occur every 40 months thus. the annual recharge rates
   for the Tarfa. Asyuti, Qena, and Hammamat alluvial aquifers are
   estimated at 4.7 X 10(6) in. 6 X 10(6) m(3) 14.7 x 10(6) m(3) and 17.7 X
   10(6) m(3), respectively. Implications for the use of these renewable
   ground waters, and similar water resources in other arid areas of Egypt
   and in neighboring countries are clear. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Data on sediment discharge and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) at
   two hydrological stations from 1951 to 2000 were utilized to study the
   variation in river sediment supply to the delta, Literature and
   document,,, on darn construction and water withdrawal were collected,
   and combined with field investigations on deforestation/afforestation
   and extraction of riverbed sediment. to examine the influence of human
   activities on river sediment load, From 1950's to 1960's, the river
   sediment discharge and SSC increased by 10 and 12\% respectively, Since
   1960's. both values have shown a significant reduction. with sediment
   discharge 34\% lower and SSC 38\% lower in the 1990's than in the
   1960's. These changes are found to be governed by the balance between
   two aspects of human activities: deforestation and dam construction. It
   was predicted that river sediment discharge and SSC in the future 100
   years would probably be reduced to less than 50\% of the present (the
   average of the past 50 years) due to human activities especially the
   Three Gorges Dam. which will be put into operation in 2003. The effect
   of this reduction on the deltaic coast is also briefly addressed. (C)

Abstract = {{In Berlin many weils are constructed with an additional small diameter
   bypass tube flanged on to the large diameter casing and running parallel
   to the later upward to the surface. The response to a slug test
   conducted in such a well is usually characterised by significant water
   level oscillations developing inside the branched pipe system. In the
   present paper, a general non-linear model is developed for the analysis
   of slug tests performed in bypassed wells, The model includes skin
   effects, non-linear head losses due to internal well bore fluid friction
   minor losses originating at radius change, along the flow path inside
   the well and inertial effects of the water columns contained within the
   primary casing and the bypass Pipe flow inside the branched tubing
   system is described by the one-dimensional conservation law of the
   mechanical energy of the well bore fluid. Aquifer flow is quartified by
   a convolution-type approach. The coupled well-aquifer system is governed
   by all integro-differential equation representing the mean mechanical
   energy of the total kell bore fluid and, coupled to it, by a non-linear
   ordinary differential equation which accounts for mechanical energy
   fluctuations between the water columns inside the main casing and the
   bypass. Both equations are solved by finite difference approximations
   coupled to point iterative numerical techniques. An application of the
   model to field data suggests that non-linear hydraulic head losses
   originating inside the well bore may cause the measured head responses
   to depend on the initial displacement. A packer used to initiate a slug
   test can induce these non-linear distortions through the combined effect
   of minor losses originating at the inlet and the outlet of a small
   diameter packer flow-through tube and internal fluid friction
   potentially developing inside that packer passage. As classical linear
   theories do not allow for the analysis of such phenomena a model
   accounting, for these non-linear processes should be used if field data
   show significant dependencies on the initial slug height. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Hydrology plays a critical role in wetland development and ecosystem
   structure and functions, Hydrologic responses to forest management and
   climate change are diverse in the Southern United States due to
   topographic and climatic differences. This paper presents a comparison
   study on long-term hydrologic characteristics (long-term seasonal runoff
   patterns. water balances. storm flow patterns) of three watersheds in
   the southern US. These three watersheds represent three types of forest
   ecosystems commonly found in the lower Atlantic coastal plain and the
   Appalachian upland mountains, Compared to the warm, flat. and shallow
   groundwater dominated pine flatwoods on the coast, tire inland upland
   watershed was found to have significantly higher water yield,
   Precipitation/Hamon's potential evapotranspiration ratio (1.9 for upland
   vs 1.4 and 0.9 for wetlands), and runoff/precipitation ratio (0.53 +/-
   0.092 for upland vs 0.30 +/- 0.079 and 0.13 +/- 0.094 for wetlands),
   Streamflow fi-orn flatwoods watersheds generally are discontinuous most
   of the years while the upland watershed showed continuous flows in most
   years. Storm flow peaks in a cypress-pine flatwoods system were smaller
   than that in the upland watershed for most cases, but exceptions
   occur-red under extreme wet conditions. Our study concludes that climate
   is the most important factor in deter-mining the watershed water
   balances in the southern US. Topography effects streamflow patterns and
   stormflow peaks and volume. and is the key to wetland development in the
   southern US. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Water table dynamics in tile-drained fields have been thoroughly
   investigated by numerous researchers. Recent studies have highlighted
   the importance of incorporating the effects of evaporation into the
   design of such drainage systems. In tropical areas, evaporation plays a
   particularly crucial role in lowering the water table in finely textured
   soils, In this paper, water table dynamics are investigated for the case
   of coupled drainage and evaporation. A simple analytical model that
   determines the relative contribution of the drainage component to the
   draw down of the water table is proposed. The model's estimates compare
   reasonably well to field data, as well as those derived from numerical
   simulations conducted for various evaporation rates and soil types. When
   presented in a non-dimensional form, the model's results can provide a
   quick estimate of the relative contribution of drainage to lowering the
   water table, which is highly relevant to the hydrology of acid sulphate
   soils. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{In a subtropical mountain of northern Mexico. soils and slopes seem to
   have a hortonian functioning, as it is commonly observed in other
   tropical or subtropical areas. So it is important to know previous soil
   moisture before any rainfall event in order to properly estimate the
   runoff coefficients and to get a better understanding of the hydrologic
   behaviour of the catchments.
   A very simple deterministic model, named NAZASM, is developed and tested
   for 6 microplots (1 and 10 m(2)), 13 plots (50 m(2)) and 5 catchments
   (1-50 km(2)). It is based on the `antecedent precipitation index' with
   an exponential decay parameter (a) into the rainfall-runoff
   relationship, Measurements of rainfall and runoff were made during four
   rainy seasons. Between 22 and 157 rain events were considered in the
   analysis. depending on the sizes of the plots and catchments.
   `NAZASM' gives reasonable estimations of runoff if the calibration data
   set includes events occurring during wet and dry years. due to the
   difference of hydrological processes involved in these two situations.
   All the results have shown that the use of such a model significantly
   improves the explained variances between measured runoff and rainfall as
   compared to classical regression analysis whatever the size of plots and
   catchments are.
   The alpha soil water content decay parameter which in theory is a soil
   characteristic. appeared in fact to be scale dependent. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Along the middle reach of the Seine river, upstream from Paris, riparian
   wetlands that have been functioning for centuries, first as a result of
   a succession of sedimentological/hydrological processes and later of
   continuous management practices where the value of the wetlands has been
   acknowledged as well as their importance for the ecology. Here, we
   present the results of a multidisciplinary research programme focused on
   this system with emphasis on its present hydrological functioning and on
   the tools used to understand and quantify it. The major hydrological and
   geochemical processes that are active at present are reviewed, but past
   processes are also described as well as the potential long-term
   evolution of the system. This study uses several innovative tools to
   investigate the wetlands and analyse them in space: thermographic aerial
   survey and electromagnetic prospecting resulting in a map of clay-layer
   thickness, Concerning the wetland hydrology, water budgets, established
   at different time scales (several years, one year, a season) illustrate
   the exchanges between the watershed, the river and the wetland and water
   storage in the wetlands during flood events. The results show how the
   upstream reservoirs, built during the last 20 years, presently control
   the preservation and functioning of downstream riparian wetlands.
   Monitoring and modelling of the hydrological functioning of one wetland
   site have made it possible to identify and quantify exchanges between
   the wetland (especially in the unsaturated upper layer) and its
   environment. In situ measurements of denitrification rates in the
   wetland were used to make initial estimates of its nitrate-elimination
   capacity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Using the same data set as in Part I of this series (obtained from a
   dense rain gauge network operating with 15 s sampling over the period
   September 1991 to December 1993). the rainfall climatology of Norfolk
   Island is examined in terms of the relationship between rainfall
   accumulations R and fractional time raining (FTR) F In addition. linear.
   cubic and power-law fits to the relationship are used as estimators and
   compared with actual monthly mean rainfall totals at integrations of I
   h, I day and I month. Cumulative errors in estimated island mean
   rainfall are compared as a function of both the monthly march and as a
   function of increasing F. It is shown that F may be used successfully to
   provide estimates of rainfall accumulation even at the shortest
   integration time (when the R-F relationship is non-linear) by way of the
   cubic fit. Temporal variations in the fitting parameters are found to be
   similar at each gauge site and spatial differences in fitting parameters
   between sites are systematic. On a year-by-year basis. the mean rainfall
   per FTR was found to decrease Lit all sites. A high correlation between
   the two parameters of the power-law, fitting method enables R and F to
   be related using a single-parameter. though estimates are generally
   inferior to the linear or cubic fit. Using integration times of 12, 24,
   48 and 96 h. the data set was sampled at intervals between 15 s (the
   present gauge array resolution) and 1800 s (a typical remote sensing
   resolution) providing R-F correlation trends and mean rainfall per unit
   F. Outputs from the sampling could not be normalized in terms of an
   integration-to-sampling time ratio. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Safe yield is commonly defined as the largest quantity of water that can
   be withdrawn without causing any negative effects in the area of
   interest, When, negative effects are induced by over-pumping, the safe
   yield must be reinterpreted according to the present conditions.
   Therefore, the optimum yield, defined as the quantity of water that can
   be withdrawn from the groundwater aquifer with minimum expected losses,
   is introduced to balance the economic profit and environmental
   protection in groundwater management. A decision model based on the loss
   function concept is presented to estimate the optimum yield from a
   groundwater basin, which has experienced seawater intrusion and
   subsidence caused by over-pumping. The model employs loss functions,
   which account for environmental deterioration and economic profit
   according to the hydrogeological conditions and pumping rates, The
   optimum yield from a groundwater basin can thus be obtained by
   minimizing the expected value of the loss function. The method is
   applied to a groundwater basin in Yun-Lin. Taiwan. Analysis results
   indicate that the optimum yield of groundwater in this region is 619
   million ton/yr, which is far lower than the current annual groundwater
   consumption, The method is more conservative than the conventional water
   balance method and is thus a more effective means of managing water
   resource conservation. Further environmental damage may be prevented if
   the loss function method proposed herein for determining the optimum
   yield can be applied to planning groundwater resources in the future.

Abstract = {{This study identified and examined differences in Southeast Alaskan
   streamflow patterns between the two most recent modes of the Pacific
   decadal oscillation (PDO). ldentifying relationships between the PDO and
   specific regional phenomena is important for understanding climate
   variability. interpreting historical hydrological variability. and
   improving water-resources forecasting. Stream discharge data from six
   watersheds in Southeast Alaska were divided into cold-PDO (1947-1976)
   and warm-PDO (1977-1998) subsets. For all watersheds, the average annual
   streamflows during cold-PDO years were not significantly different from
   warm-PDO years. Monthly and seasonal discharges, however, did differ
   significantly between the two subsets. with the warm-PDO winter flows
   being typically higher than the cold-PDO winter flows and the warm-PDO
   summer flows being typically lower than the cold-PDO flows. These
   results were consistent with and driven by observed temperature and
   snowfall patterns for the region. During warm-PDO winters, precipitation
   fell as rain and ran-off immediately, causing higher than normal winter
   streamflow. During cold-PDO winters, precipitation was stored as snow
   and ran off during the summer snowmelt, creating greater summer
   streamflows. The Mendenhall River was unique in that it experienced
   higher flows for all seasons during the warm-PDO relative to the
   cold-PDO. The large amount of Mendenhall River discharge caused by
   glacial melt during warm-PDO summers offset any flow reduction caused by
   lack of snow accumulation during warm-PDO winters. The effect of the PDO
   on Southeast Alaskan watersheds differs from other regions of the
   Pacific Coast of North America in that monthly/seasonal discharge
   patterns changed dramatically with the switch in PDO modes but annual
   discharge did not. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In Sana'a, the capital of the Yemen Arab Republic, a major well
   inventory was compiled in 1995 during which samples were analysed for
   major cations and anions. Five years later the opportunity as taken to
   repeat the exercise on a sub-set of the original wells. The results
   showed that groundwater in the urban area was characterised by high
   concentrations of almost all major cations and anions due to the
   continuous infiltration of wastewater into the aquifers via cesspits.
   The dominant watertype appeared to be CaCl2. The Cl -concentration
   ranged from 3 to 10 mmol/l and NO3 -concentration ranged from 1 to 3
   mmol/l while NH4- was absent in all samples. It is concluded that cation
   exchange has taken place. Ca-2 in groundwater has been enriched, while
   Na+, K+ and NH4+ have been depleted. Groundwater affected by wastewater
   had pH values of 0.5-1 unit lower than groundwater not affected by
   wastewater, indicating that acidification has taken place. Over the
   period between the two surveys, concentrations of almost all major
   anions and cations increased, while pH decreased, both owing to the
   continuous infiltration of wastewater. An exploratory one-dimensional
   transport model of a 200 m column of the aquifer underlying Sana'a
   showed that over a 15-year period of continuous wastewater infiltration,
   a quarter of the NH4+ present in raw sewage would oxidise to NO3 thereby
   producing acidity and some 60\% would he adsorbed. The model indicates
   that after 50 years of wastewater infiltration, exchange of NH4+ has
   become limited due to the limited cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the
   soil. Therefore more NH4+ will be oxidised to NO3+ and {[}NO3] in
   groundwater will rise, At the same time. groundwater in the zone of NH4+
   oxidation will become very acid due to a lack of buffering minerals. The
   modelling studies, together with the results from the surveys. tend to
   indicate that up to 12\% of the current population of the City could be
   dependent on contaminated groundwater for their drinking water supply.

Abstract = {{Spatial variability of surface hydraulic properties is an important
   factor for infiltration and runoff processes in agricultural fields. At
   120 locations on a hillslope, steady-state infiltration rates were
   measured at two applied pressure heads with a single-ring infiltrometer.
   The solution of two steady-state infiltration equations for each
   location (the simultaneous-equation approach, SEA) yielded 41 negative
   alpha-values, 79 positive alpha values and 120 positive K(fs)-values.
   The sensitivity of K(fs) and alpha to small measurement errors was
   estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation (MC). Results of this MC
   simulation showed that the uncertainty on alpha is extremely high while
   the uncertainty on K(fs) is fairly small. Hence, although the pressure
   infiltrometer technique as applied here is useful to estimate K(fs) at
   each measurement location, it is not suited for the estimation of an
   alpha-value at each measurement location. A new procedure is proposed
   for the simultaneous estimation of one overall `field alpha' and the 79
   K(fs) values of measurement locations having a positively calculated a
   using SEA. Using this field alpha, K(fs) values for the other locations
   with a negative a are hence determined. Finally, the spatial correlation
   of K(fs) on the hillslope is examined. Ranges of ln(K(fs)) between 2.85
   and 3.8 m were observed, respectively, for the omnidirectional case and
   the y direction along the hillslope mu. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{An analysis of the historic flows and water temperatures of the Fraser
   River system has detected trends in both the annual flow profile and the
   summer temperatures. This study was undertaken to determine if these
   trends are likely to continue under the conditions predicted by various
   global circulation models. To do this, existing flock and temperature
   models were run with weather data that were derived from actual weather
   observations, but modified using changes predicted by the global
   circulation models. The validity of the flow model results is supported
   by very close agreement with the historical record. The differences
   between model output and the historical record for mean flow, mean peak
   flow, mean minimum flow and peak now day were not statistically
   significant: furthermore, there was only a 3-4 day shift in the
   occurrence of cumulative flow milestones. The temperature model's mean
   water temperature was only 0.2 degreesC higher than the historical
   record. For the period 2070-2099. the flow model predicted a modest 5\%
   (150 m(2)/s) average flow increase but a decrease in the average peak
   flow of about 18\% (1600 m(3)/s). These peaks would occur, on average.
   24 days earlier in the year even though for 13\% of the years the peak
   flow occurred much later as a result of summer or fall rain. instead of
   the currently normal spring freshet. In the same period. the summer mean
   water temperature is predicted to increase by 19 degreesC. The potential
   exposure of salmon to water temperatures above 20 degreesC. which may
   degade their spawning success, is predicted to increase by a factor of
   10. Trends in both flow and temperature in this study closely match the
   trends in the historical record. 1961-1990. which suggests that the
   historical trends may already be related to climate change, While the
   mean flow of 2726 m(2)/s does not show a statistically significant
   trend. the hydrological profile has been changing. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Groundwater storage in the High Plains aquifer has been steadily
   decreasing for 50 or more years due to withdrawals for irrigation. This
   trend has been documented in annually published United States Geological
   Survey reports of water level changes in the High Plains aquifer. but
   assessments of groundwater storage changes in other parts of the world
   are incomplete. NASA's gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE)
   soon may provide an alternative means for monitoring groundwater
   changes, via satellite remote sensing. That terrestrial water storage
   changes are likely to be detectable by GRACE satellites has been
   demonstrated by prior studies, This investigation builds on those
   studies by evaluating the potential for isolating changes in the
   groundwater component of terrestrial water storage. In the High Plains,
   the magnitude of annual groundwater storage changes averaged 19.8 mm
   between 1987 and 1998. Uncertainty in deriving estimates of High Plains
   aquifer storage changes from GRACE observations will arise mainly from
   the removal, via land surface modeling, of the effects of soil moisture
   changes from the gravity signal. Total uncertainty is predicted to be
   about 8.7 mm. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to extensive research on hydrological processes operating in
   headwater basins, there has been relatively little attention paid to the
   hydrological processes that occur on the floodplains of lowland rivers.
   This dearth of information is all the more surprising given current
   interest in the use of floodplains as buffer zones between farmland and
   the riverine environment. In the previous paper (Water Resour. Res. 36
   (2000) 2517), Bates et al., reported preliminary results from a field
   site on the floodplain of the River Severn in Shropshire. UK, a large
   lowland river by British standards. Piezometric data suggested that
   during out-of-bank conditions a reverse groundwater ridge develops in
   the floodplain subsurface and results in strong groundwater flux
   velocities directed towards the base of hillslopes adjoining the
   floodplain. Bates et al. showed that the impact of such ridges was to
   switch off hillslope inputs to the riparian zone; they hypothesised that
   this occurred when surface inundation approached the back of the
   floodplain. In this paper, we provide a more detailed analysis of the
   events considered by Bates et al. and extend the analysis to the more
   common in-bank flood condition. In total, five events are considered
   (two out-of-bank and three in-bank); these were chosen to represent a
   wide range of event magnitudes, antecedent conditions and local patterns
   of rainfall and runoff. The analysis demonstrates that the reverse
   groundwater ridging process identified by Bates et al. also occurs
   during in-bank events. Hillslope inputs to the floodplain are also
   `switched off' in these events if the flood stage is high. In smaller
   floods, water continues to move from slope to floodplain, although
   coupling between slope and channel is only re-established later in the
   recession. We conclude that, contrary to the conclusions of Bates et
   al., this process switching is not necessarily dependent on surface
   inundation approaching the back of the floodplain. Whilst the paper
   broadly confirms the operation of the simple reverse groundwater ridging
   process described by Bates et al., it shows that antecedent conditions,
   local rainfall and runoff, and flood stage all act to complicate this
   basic pattern. Lastly, we consider the implications for catchment water
   quality of the newly identified processes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The effect of the speed of a time-domain reflectometry (TDR) pulse
   through the core rod and the shield rod(s) of TDR probes on the
   dielectric constant and water content of a soil with heterogeneous water
   content distribution in the transverse direction to the probe length was
   investigated. Soil samples were prepared using sands of two different
   water contents, which were kept side by side to get transverse
   heterogeneous water content distribution. The dielectric constant and
   water content of these samples (here after denoted by epsilon(TDR) and
   theta(TDR), respectively) were measured by TDR. The expected dielectric
   constants of the samples, epsilon(g), were calculated using the equation
   of Topp et al. (1980) from the volumetric soil-water contents, theta(g),
   measured gravimetrically assuming that this equation was applicable to
   our soil. The TDR pulse traveled faster through the probe rod inserted
   in the dry sand due to its low dielectric constant than through the
   probe rod inserted in the wet sand. So, early reflection of the pulse
   occurred in the dry sand, which shortened the travel path of the pulse
   and caused underestimation of the dielectric constant and soil-water
   content. The degree of this underestimation was higher when the core rod
   of the probe was in dry sand than when was this same rod in wet sand.
   Although TDR measurements were apparently controlled by the dry part of
   the sample, theta(TDR) was always higher than the water content of the
   dry sand, theta(dry), in the sample. TDR thus could measure neither the
   average dielectric constant and soil-water content of the sample nor it
   measured those for the dry part or for the wet part of the sample when
   soil-water distribution was heterogeneous in the transverse direction of
   the probe rods. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Field monitoring of natural pipeflow over the last two decades has
   demonstrated its potential importance both as a hillslope drainage
   process and as a source of streamflow, yet very few attempts have been
   made to model the process. The main model designed to simulate pipeflow
   to date is shown to be unrepresentative of the natural field situation.
   This paper describes a semi-distributed simulation model with physically
   based parameters that has been designed around the field situation, as
   monitored in the longest run field experiment on pipeflow. The results
   are encouraging, despite the fact that data on a number of relevant
   parameters can be difficult to obtain at less intensely studied field

Abstract = {{Strontium and carbon isotopes are used to study the effect of carbonate
   mineral dissolution, and inter-aquifer mixing on the chemical evolution
   of groundwater from the Murray Group Limestone Aquifer in semi-arid SE
   Australia. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of groundwater evolves from 0.7097 at
   the basin margin to a less radiogenic value of 0.7084 about 250 km
   down-gradient, which is similar to the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of the aquifer
   carbonate matrix. The concomitant increase in delta(13)C(DIC), Sr/Ca and
   Mg/Ca ratios in the groundwater along a 250 km transect suggests that
   incongruent dissolution of high Mg-calcite controls the carbonate
   geochemistry in this aquifer. Further down-gradient, the groundwater is
   characterized by a relatively more radiogenic Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio caused
   by upward leakage and mixing with more radiogenic groundwater from the
   Renmark Group Sand Aquifer. A mixing model using Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio
   suggests that the fraction of water that contribute to the Murray Group
   Aquifer through upward leakage from underlying Renmark Group Aquifer
   ranges from 15 to 85\%. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional groundwater flow model was constructed to investigate
   the long-term hydrologic impacts of Lake Nasser and the major land
   reclamation projects that use excess lake water in southwest Egypt.
   Egypt constructed (1964-1971) the Aswan High Dam, creating the Lake
   Nasser reservoir (length: 500 km; average width: 12 km) and is
   constructing the Tushka Canal to channel 5.0 x 10(9) m(3)/yr of Lake
   Nasser water to reclaim 0.5 x 10(6) acres of desert lands. The model,
   constrained by regional-scale groundwater flow and near-lake head data,
   was successfully calibrated to temporal-observation heads from 1970 to
   2000 that reflect variations in lake levels. Predictive analyses for the
   subsequent 50-yr period were conducted by employing the calibrated
   model. Simulations of long-term effects, beyond year 2000, of Lake
   Nasser on recharge and temporal groundwater head (base case scenario)
   show that recharge from the lake will continue at a much slower rate
   than during the 30-yr period of 1970-2000 (with approximately 86\%
   reduction in 30-yr recharge). The modest projected pumping and injection
   activities in the study area are not expected to cause major deviation
   in the overall head distribution compared to the base case scenario. The
   investigation of effects of the new irrigation land development on the
   Nubian aquifer indicated that many of the proposed irrigation areas,
   especially those with small aquifer thickness, will become fully
   saturated with introduced water, resulting in potential flooding and
   salinization. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anecdotal evidence suggests that farm dams have an impact on the
   streamflow regime of a catchment. There is however a notable absence of
   suitable information on the nature and magnitude of these impacts. This
   work seeks to address this knowledge gap by identifying the nature of
   the impact of farm dams on the hydrology of catchments in the
   Murray-Darling Drainage Division. Australia. The 12 catchments selected
   for this analysis span zones of the Division with very different
   climatic and land use conditions. In 11 of the catchments considered
   there has been an increase in farm dam development over the last two to
   three decades. The remaining catchment, on the Jamieson River, has
   undergone no land use changes over the last 50 years and was selected as
   a control catchment for testing our approach. Statistically significant
   reductions in the quantity, potential streamflow response (PSR), were
   found for two catchments, the Yass River and Broadwater Creek. The
   average annual increase in farm dam capacity in these two catchments was
   1.5 and 3.3\% of mean annual flow, respectively. The remaining nine
   catchments displayed no statistically significant reductions in PSR for
   the entire period of simulation. Farm dam capacity information was
   available for five of the nine catchments. These five catchments
   displayed significantly smaller increases in farm dam capacity (not more
   than 0.3\% of mean annual flow per year) than the Yass River and
   Broadwater Creek catchments. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We report results of the project, European River Flood Occurrence and
   Total Risk Assessment System (EUROTAS), which was aimed at assessing the
   risk of current and future floodings for Europe, including the effects
   of climatic change. With respect to the latter, precipitation scenarios
   have been derived from a global climate model using the method of
   expanded downscaling (EDS), and regionalized for the catchment of the
   river Pinios (Greece). Jizera (Cechia), Saar (Germany), and Thames (UK).
   We present both the climate change information conveyed by the scenarios
   and an assessment about its statistical significance. For this report,
   all simulations were rerun using an improved EDS model version. Most
   notably, the inclusion of atmospheric humidity to the set of global
   predictor fields helped reducing the underlying uncertainty of the
   results. When driven by observed atmospheric fields (analyses), the EDS
   model performed in most cases satisfactorily, as it reproduced the
   larger precipitation clusters with good accuracy. To evaluate the
   precipitation scenarios, a statistical test was applied that compared
   what we defined as `current climate' with the `changed climate' of the
   scenario. To define current climate, local precipitation observations
   were used together with EDS regionalizations of the analyses and of a
   climate model control simulation.
   It turned out that in spite of the considerable uncertainty stemming
   from model errors and, more importantly, natural variability, a
   significant redistribution of rainfall is projected. Specifically, the
   scenarios show a decay of rainfall frequency for all catchments, which
   for Pinios leads to an overall negative water balance. This is
   accompanied, and for the other catchments outweighed, by a strong
   rainfall intensification. For the latter, we provide a more detailed
   extreme value analysis. We emphasize that the results should be
   interpreted with caution and not overemphasized quantitatively.
   Scenarios of precipitation are still of prototype nature and under
   steady development. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Runoff generation processes in the Canadian Shield were investigated to
   reconcile the considerable variability of runoff ratios noted by
   previous studies. Four bedrock plots near Yellowknife, Northwest
   Territories, Canada were studied between May 1999 and September 2000.
   Surface runoff increases with rainfall and snowmelt intensity because
   higher values of the latter can exceed fracture infiltration capacities.
   The size distribution of fractures affects infiltration while the
   fracture network controls the direction of surface flow. Frost has no
   effect on infiltration since the fractures are seldom ice filled. Storms
   of long duration and intermittent rainfall provide intervals between
   rainfalls during which evaporation can reduce the water available to
   runoff. Available storage in bedrock depressions, both empty and soil
   filled, retard surface flow and lengthen residence time, in turn
   enhancing evaporation and infiltration at the expense of runoff. The
   further downslope available storage is on the slope the more control it
   has on plot runoff magnitude. These field results show that
   rainfall-runoff relationships for bedrock slopes in the Canadian Shield
   should be considered in terms of microtopography, bedrock and soil
   characteristics and climate. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An isotope-based approach for water balance assessment is presented and
   applied to estimate throughflow, residence time and catchment runoff to
   70 headwater lakes on the Boreal plain and uplands of northern and
   north-central Alberta, Canada. The survey reveals a complex hydrologic
   regime with systematic variability in water balance due to local site
   characteristics. On average, runoff to lakes in wetland-dominated
   catchments is found to be significantly higher than runoff to
   upland-dominated lakes, with generally higher contributions from
   catchments with low bog/fen ratios. The isotope method, which relies
   primarily on water sampling and isotopic analysis, can be easily
   integrated in routine water quality surveys and is shown to be a
   practical alternative to conventional hydrological modelling for
   comparative analysis of water balance controls on hydrochemistry and
   aquatic ecology of lakes, particularly in low-relief wetland-rich

Abstract = {{An energy balance approach is applied to simulate snow accumulation and
   melt in a forest clearing and in a coniferous forest. The study site is
   located in southern Finland (60.1degreesN) where the winters are mild
   considering the high latitude. For forest simulations the snow model is
   coupled with a procedure, which accounts for the effects of the canopy
   on the driving meteorological variables of the snow model. Model results
   are first validated against measured values of snow water equivalent and
   snow temperature in a forested site and in an adjacent clearing.
   Subsequently differences in snow accumulation, snowmelt, and energy
   components contributing to snowmelt in open and forested conditions are
   studied. Effect of the canopy on snow mass balance on the ground can be
   seen as higher accumulation and more intense snowmelt in the open. Due
   to these counteracting processes the results show little difference in
   the annual maximum of the snow water equivalent between the clearing and
   the forest. The model results suggest that in mid-winter the main source
   of energy for snowmelt is sensible heat in the open, whereas both
   sensible heat and net radiation contribute equally to snowmelt in the
   forest. Solar radiation intensity increases towards the spring, which
   causes net radiation to become dominant in both sites. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{One-dimensional analytical porosity-weighted solutions of the
   dual-porosity model are derived, providing insights on how to relate
   exchange and storage coefficients to the volumetric density of the
   high-permeability medium. It is shown that porosity-weighted storage and
   exchange coefficients are needed when handling highly heterogeneous
   systems-such as karstic aquifers-using equivalent dual-porosity models.
   The sensitivity of these coefficients is illustrated by means of
   numerical experiments with theoretical karst systems. The presented ID
   dual-porosity analytical model is used to reproduce the hydraulic
   responses of reference 3D karst aquifers, modelled by a discrete
   single-continuum approach. Under various stress conditions, simulation
   results show the relations between the dual-porosity model coefficients
   and the structural features of the discrete single-continuum model. The
   calibration of the equivalent 1D analytical dual-porosity model on
   reference hydraulic responses confirms the dependence of the exchange
   coefficient with the karstic network density. The use of the analytical
   model could also point out some fundamental structural properties of the
   karstic network that rule the shape of the hydraulic responses, such as
   density and connectivity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Water resource droughts in the UK have occurred with regularity over the
   last 20 years. In Yorkshire, the most severe of these was from 1995 to
   1996, with a return period estimate of over 200 years. `Severe' drought
   events since 1881 in the Yorkshire region are classified using two
   drought severity indices based on 3- and 6-monthly cumulative
   precipitation anomalies. Atmospheric circulation contrasts associated
   with the droughts are analysed and a methodology developed to identify
   water resource droughts in Yorkshire using historical weather-type
   information rather than precipitation data.
   Using a weather-type index to extend drought series and revise estimates
   of drought return periods is a potentially useful technique. The
   methodology is applied from 1881 to 1998 and highlights a large number
   of severe drought events between 1884 and 1896 which can be
   substantiated using anecdotal evidence. However, the drought events of
   the 1880s and 1890s have not generally been used when calculating return
   periods for recent drought events due to scarcity of long-term daily
   precipitation data. The validity of return period estimates of recent
   drought events must therefore be questioned. This research confirms the
   need for the reassessment of return period estimates for contemporary
   drought events particularly given current climatic trends, the rapid
   onset of recent droughts and rising water demands. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The major ion, SiO2 and minor element contents of Batura Glacier
   meltwaters in the headwaters of the Indus Basin, Pakistan are examined.
   The data are used to examine the controls upon solute acquisition by
   runoff and to estimate solute yields. Solute yield calculations include
   estimation of the total and silicate-derived cationic denudation rates
   following the application of simple solute provenance models.
   Examination of meltwater composition shows that, like other glacier
   basins reported in the literature, much of the solute content of runoff
   is acquired from carbonate weathering. Hence, HCO3- accounts for 80\% of
   the equivalent anionic content of runoff, whilst {[}Ca2+ Mg2+] accounts
   for 89\% of the equivalent cation content. The small excess of {[}Ca2+ +
   Mg2+] over HCO3- is largely balanced by non-marine SO42-. Otherwise,
   silicate weathering accounts for ca. 15\% of the cation content and
   appears to produce runoff with high Sr2+/Ca2+ ratios.
   Chemical denudation in the Batura Glacier Basin produces a yield of ca.
   88 ton km(-2) a(-1), or 75\% of the entire solute yield. The
   corresponding dissolved SiO2 yield is 2.4 ton km(-2) a(-1) and the
   cationic denudation rate is ca. 1600 meq(-) m(-2) a(-1). Data from three
   other studies suggest that a range of 660-4200 meq(+) m(-2) a(-1) is
   likely for Himalayan glacier basins with between 1.6 and 6.5 m a(-1)
   specific annual runoff. These rates are high relative to Arctic glaciers
   and similar to upper values observed in temperate and Icelandic glacier
   basins. The silicate-derived cationic denudation rate for the Batura
   Glacier Basin is approximately 240 meq(+) m(-2) a(-1), whilst the
   corresponding range for all of the Himalayan glacier basins is 240-970
   meq(+) m(-2) a(-1). These yields are again high, which is most likely to
   reflect high flushing rates caused by ablation and monsoon precipitation
   delivery. However, the very incongruent nature of silicate weathering by
   the dilute glacial meltwaters means that these cation yields are
   accompanied by only modest dissolved SiO2 yields relative to global
   means. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The soil water assessment tool (SWAT) is a hydrologic model originally
   developed to evaluate water resources in large agricultural basins. SWAT
   was not designed to model heterogeneous mountain basins typical of the
   western United States, and as a result, has performed poorly when
   applied to mountainous locations. The intent of this study was to
   increase the versatility of SWAT by developing the capability to
   simulate hydrology of a non-agricultural mountainous region with a large
   snowmelt component. A western Wyoming basin, representative of Rocky
   Mountain basins, was selected to evaluate model performance, identify
   governing hydrologic processes, and improve the snowmelt routine. An
   initial evaluation of SWAT performance indicated an inability of the
   model to represent snowmelt processes. Based on simulation results and
   field observations, algorithms were developed which use elevation bands
   to distribute temperature and precipitation with elevation. Additional
   routines which control snowpack temperature, meltwater production, and
   areal snow coverage were designed to simulate the influence of season
   and elevation on the evolution of basin snowpack. The development of the
   new snowmelt algorithms improved the average annual Nash-Sutcliffe R-2
   correlation between simulated and observed Wind River streamflow from an
   initial value of -0.70 to +0.86. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   potential theory and superposition to delineate the capture zone curves
   of extraction wells. This algorithm is more flexible than previously
   published techniques and allows the user to determine the capture zone
   for a number of arbitrarily positioned extraction wells pumping at
   different rates. The algorithm is applied to determine the capture zones
   and optimal well spacing of two wells pumping at different flow rates
   and positioned at various orientations to the direction of regional
   groundwater flow. The algorithm is also applied to determine capture
   zones for non-colinear three-well configurations as well as to determine
   optimal well spacing for up to six wells pumping at the same rate. We
   show that the optimal well spacing is found by minimizing the difference
   in the stream function evaluated at the stagnation points. Published by

Abstract = {{In this paper we present an analytical formulation of the derived
   distribution of peak flood and maximum annual peak flood, starting from
   a simplified description of rainfall and surface runoff processes, and
   we show how such a distribution is useful in practical applications. The
   assumptions on rainfall dynamics include the hypotheses that the maximum
   storm depth has a Generalized Pareto distribution, and that the temporal
   variability of rainfall depth in a storm can be described via power-law
   relationships. The SCS-CN model is used to describe the soil response,
   and a lumped model is adopted to transform the rainfall excess into peak
   flood; in particular, we analyse the influence of antecedent soil
   moisture condition on the flood frequency distribution. We then
   calculate the analytical expressions of the derived distributions of
   peak flood and maximum annual peak flood. Finally, practical case
   studies are presented and discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the relationship between rainfall intensity and kinetic
   energy and its variations in time and space is important for erosion
   prediction. However, between studies considerable variations exist in
   the reported shape and coefficients of this relationship. Some
   differences can be explained by methods of measurement and
   interpretation and sample size. range and bias, while part of the
   variability corresponds to actual differences in rainfall generating
   mechanisms. The present paper critically reviews published studies of
   rainfall intensity and kinetic energy with a view to derive a general
   predictive equation of an exponential form. The performance of this
   general equation is compared to that of existing equations using
   measured rainfall intensity and kinetic energy data for a site in
   southeastern Australia. It appeared that the energy of individual storms
   could only be predicted with limited accuracy because of natural
   variations in rainfall characteristics. By and large. the general
   equation produced energy estimates that were within 10\% of predictions
   by a range of parameterisations of the exponential model fitted to
   specific data-sets. Re-calculation of rainfall erosivity factors as
   obtained by the older and revised USLE approaches does not seem
   warranted for most locations. However, in regions experiencing strong
   oceanic influence or at high elevations, overall C rainfall energy
   appears to be considerably lower than predicted by the general or USLE
   equations. Conversely, data collected at semi-arid to sub-humid
   locations suggest that rainfall energy may be higher than expected under
   those conditions. Standardised measurements are needed to evaluate
   rainfall intensity-kinetic energy relationships for such areas. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Significant amounts of fluoride are found in the abstracted groundwater

   low-fluoride flow as well as deeper thermal fluoride-rich flow in
   various proportions. Flow mixing takes place depending on the
   abstraction regime, local hydrogeology, and borehole construction design
   and operation, Fluoride concentrations (approximate to 3.7 mg l(-1))
   could become higher still. in time and space, if the input of regional
   fluoride-rich water to the abstraction boreholes is enhanced. It is
   suggested that by controlling the abstraction well-head water
   temperature at 28-30 degreesC, a pumped water mixture with a fluoride
   content close to the maximum drinking water standard of 1.5 mg l(-1)
   will be produced. Further, new boreholes and those already operating
   could take advantage of fluoride solubility controls to reduce the F
   concentration in the abstracted water by considering lithology and
   borehole construction design in order to regulate groundwater flow
   conditions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three different automated methods for calibration of rainfall-runoff
   models are presented and compared. The methods represent various
   calibration strategies that utilise multiple objectives and allow user
   intervention on different levels and different stages in the calibration
   process. The methods have been applied for calibration of a test
   catchment and compared on validation data with respect to overall
   performance measures in terms of water balance error and general
   hydrograph shape, and simulation of high and low flow, events, The
   results illustrate the problem of non-uniqueness in model calibration
   since none of the methods are superior with respect to all performance
   measures considered, In general, the different methods put emphasis on
   different response modes of the hydrograph. Calibration based on the use
   of generic search routines in combination with user-specified
   calibration priorities is seen to compare favourably with an expert
   system that is designed for the specific model being considered and
   requires user intervention during the entire calibration process. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the short-term tracking of rainstorms. using data
   from a network of 20 tipping-bucket rain-gauges located in a 600 km(2)
   region near Bolton in Northwest England. The tip-time data are first
   converted into rainrate profiles (the moving averages of hourly
   rainrates). The cross-correlation between pairs of profiles is examined
   to obtain estimated inter-gauge tags. Estimates from gauges that
   correlate poorly are discarded, since these gauges may be
   malfunctioning. The remaining estimated lags are modelled using linear
   dependencies on the spatial displacements of the gauge-pairs and the
   velocity of the rainstorm is deduced using standard formulae, Sums of
   squared deletion residual,, give a second opportunity for identifying
   gauges associated with misleading estimates. Empirical confidence
   intervals are obtained by multiple analyses using different combinations
   of tip sequences. All rainstorms between February and December 2000 were
   analysed, Of these, 171 had a mean rainrate of at least 0.4 mm/h.
   Apparently accurate estimates of storm velocity were obtained for 107
   storms. The mean speed was 34.5 km/h (9,6 m/s) with mean direction
   80degrees. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Streamline simulations have been extensively used in petroleum
   engineering due to its computational speed and the freedom from
   numerical dispersion. This study applies, streamline simulation to the
   modeling, of solute transport in a single fracture and verifies the
   streamline method with experimental data. In order to model dispersive
   transport a new term the advection-dispersion ratio is employed, which
   is defined as the relative extent of advection to dispersion along
   streamlines. It is observed that the tracer breakthrough curves from the
   simulation match well kith those from the experiment. In addition, the
   tracer displacement profiles from the simulation also show, resemblance
   to those from the experiment,.,. Simulations with various link
   transmissivity types result in no serious disparities, The distributions
   of time of flight and tracer breakthrough curves from the simulations
   using different link transmissivity typed are much alike, Transport
   simulation is performed by allocating different advection-dispersion
   ratios along streamlines, Afterwards the results are compared with the
   simulation result using single representative advection-dispersion ratio
   over the flow domain. Although streamlines actually have different
   advection-dispersion ratios, its effect is found to be not severe.
   Therefore, a representative advection-dispersion ratio can be used for
   modeling transport through the whole streamlines in a single fracture.

Title = {{Intraseasonal dynamics of soil moisture variability within a small

Abstract = {{The spatio-temporal dynamics of soil water content was investigated
   within a small agricultural maize cropped field located in Belgium. Soil
   moisture measurements were intensively, made between May, 30 and
   September 13. 1999 on 28 sampling locations at different depths (from 0
   to 125 cm) with both TDR and neutron probe. The adopted sampling scheme
   resulted in a comprehensive data set of nearly 8000 soil moisture
   measurements. Using this data set, we first probe the role of factors
   controlling the spatio-temporal soil moisture dynamics for the different
   considered soil depth. Special emphasis is thereby given to the role of
   the vegetation in the space-time relationships of soil Moisture.
   Secondly, we identify the temporal dynamics of the spatial structure of
   soil moisture pattern at different soil depth. Thirdly, we investigate
   the relationship between the mean soil moisture and the spatial
   variability across time, analysing through the season the optimal
   sampling strategies to adopt for providing the field areal soil moisture
   within a given predefined error limit. The result showed that the
   spatially variable within the held and subsequently through the process
   of evapotranspiration and the root Water Uptake, plays a non-negligible
   role in the temporal dynamics of the observed soil Moisture patterns for
   the superficial layers. The spatial structure of these soil moisture
   patterns,vas non-existent or only weakly marked. The study finally
   indicated that a negative correlation exists between the spatial
   variability and the mean soil moisture, implicitly suggesting that the
   sampling has to be more intensive for the drier conditions. Besides
   these results, this study reemphasises the importance of conducting,
   soil moisture spatial variability studies with measurements performed on
   the entire hydrological active zone and to adopt temporally unchanged
   sampling locations in order to progress in the thorough understanding of
   the physical processes generating the soil moisture spatial variability.

Abstract = {{Unlike the USLE/RUSLE models, which require only rainfall intensity data
   to quantify climatic effects on soil erosion. physically based erosion
   models require data on runoff rates as their input. However, runoff rate
   data are rarely measured in the field. This study evaluates eight models
   in terms of their performance in predicting peak (Q(p)) and effective
   (Q(e)) runoff rates required by erosion models. The eight models are:
   (1) a multiple regression model(MR), (2) a power function model (PF),
   (3) a scaling technique (ST), (4) a constant infiltration model (CI),
   (5) a constant runoff coefficient model (RC), (6) a spatially variable
   infiltration model (VI), (7) the CREAMS peak runoff rate equation (Q(p)
   CREAMS), and (8) an empirical peak runoff rate equation (Q(p) SAL).
   Rainfall and runoff data from experimental plots in a grazing catchment
   in central queensland (Australia) were used. A commonly used model
   efficiency statistic (E) was used to compare the performance of these
   models. Models resulting in high E values are said to perform better
   than models resulting in low values of E. Hence, with E values of 0.85
   and 0.81 in predicting Q(p) and Q(e), respectively, the PF model ranked
   first. On the other hand, with an E value of -1.27, the Q(p) CREAMS
   performed the worst in predicting peak runoff rates. On the basis of
   input data requirements and number of free parameters involved in each
   model, however, the VI model, with E values of 0.82 and 0.79 for Q(p)
   and Q(e), respectivley, is found to be the best choice when breakpoint
   rainfall is available for an event. If only peak rainfall intensity is
   available, the ST with E values of 0.80 and 0.63 for Q(p) and Q(e),
   respectively, would be the best model to use to predict these two runoff
   rate characteristics for the site. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Improving technique of blood frequency estimation at ungauged sites is
   one of the foremost goals of contemporary hydrology. River flood regime
   is a resultant reflection of a composite catchment hydrologic response
   to flood producing processes. In this sense the process of identifying
   homogeneous pooling groups can be plausibly based on catchment
   similarity in flood regime. Unfortunately the application of any pooling
   approach that is based on flood regime is restricted to gauged sites.
   Because flood regime can be markedly determined by rainfall regime,
   catchment similarity in rainfall regime can be an alternative option for
   identifying flood frequency pooling groups. An advantage of such a
   pooling approach is that rainfall data are usually spatially and
   temporary more abundant than flood data and the approach can also be
   applied at ungauged sites. Therefore in this study we have quantified
   the linkage between rainfall and flood regime and explored the
   appropriateness of Substituting rainfall regime for flood regime in
   regional pooling schemes. Two different approaches to describing
   rainfall regime similarity using tools of directional statistics have
   been tested and used for evaluation of the potential of rainfall regime
   for identification of hydrologically homogeneous pooling groups. The
   outputs were compared to an existing pooling framework adopted in the
   Flood Estimation Handbook, The result,, demonstrate that regional
   pooling based on rainfall regime information leads to a high number of
   initially homogeneous groups and seems to be a sound pooling alternative
   for catchments with a close linkage between rain and flood regimes. (C)

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{261}},
Number = {{1-4}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal variations of the stable isotope, oxygen-18 (O-18), were used
   to estimate mean residence times (MRTs) of water in two Valley and Ridge
   Province watersheds in central Pennsylvania. MRT was estimated by
   applying O-18 input precipitation signatures to response function models
   that describe flow conditions in the subsurface system. Precipitation
   O-18 is usually seasonally periodic; however, during this study period
   (March 1998 to June 1999), unusual weather conditions and severe drought
   caused an abnormal seasonal signature in precipitation O-18. The
   atypical input precipitation amounts and O-18 signatures required that
   adjustments be made using recharge factors and an extended past input
   function to represent the varying fraction of input water that
   contributed to turnover within the watershed during the study period.
   Oxygen-18 variations were investigated in output waters from tension and
   zero-tension soil water lysimeters, shallow wells, and streamflow. Soil
   water O-18 signatures were more responsive to precipitation O-18
   variations than streamflow O-18 signatures. Theoretical models based on
   exponential piston-flow and dispersion flow processes fit data better
   than did other groundwater age distribution models (i.e. pure piston
   flow or pure exponential models). Analysis suggested that during drought
   conditions, larger portions of older water dominated streamflow O-18
   composition, and that the current year's precipitation O-18 signature
   became more attenuated in the subsurface flow system. MRTs obtained for
   streamflow at each site were 9.5 and 4.8 months for a 14 and 100 ha
   watershed, respectively, and soil water MRT at 100 cm depth was on the
   order of a couple months; indicating a relatively rapid response of
   shallow groundwater to precipitation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper describes the simulation of a succession of annual
   hydro-periods describing water table variations in a British floodplain
   wetland, Narborough Bog. This is achieved through the application of a
   model, developed using MODFLOW, which requires inputs of weekly
   precipitation, evapotranspiration and river stage. The model reproduces
   the observed temporal variation in the wetland water tables illustrating
   the range in water table conditions experienced by the wetland, their
   relationship to hydrometeorological conditions, and the seasonal and
   annual variability in the wetland water budget. The model also estimates
   defuse water fluxes such as seepage flows to and from the adjacent
   river. The model simulations demonstrate the importance of successful
   representation of the stratigraphy of alluvial and organic deposits
   within the wetland. Model performance is evaluated for 2 years: 1991 and
   1992 during a period of field instrumentation. The model is then used to
   reproduce the wetland hydroperiod for further 6 years: 1979, 1980, 1982,
   1983, 1987 and 1988 when local data for precipitatio, evapotranspiration
   and river stage are available. The results indicate how the wetland
   responds to a combination of hydrological events and emphasise the
   importance of percipitation-both weekly totals and its annual
   distribution. The model simulations reveal the importance of the water
   storage function of the wetland and indicate the varying relationship of
   the wetland to the lowland river: at low flows the river represents a
   base level to which the wetland water table grades. Conversely, for
   small periods of time wetland water tables are elevated by the effects
   of marginal silt-clay levee adjacent to the riverbank. Conditions of
   influent seepage from river to wetland were experienced only on isolated
   occasions. Such results demonstrate the benefits of floodplain wetlands
   in moderating extremes of river flow and demonstrating the need for
   rivers and floodplain wetland to remain closely integrated. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Based on previous studies, it can be hypothesized that mean residence
   times of water increase of both sampling depth and upslope contributing
   area. To test this hypothesis, mean residence times of waters were
   evaluated with conceptual flow models using nearly sinusoidal variations
   of deltaD in rainfall and throughfall in two adjacent steep unchannelled
   catchments in the Tanakami Mountains of Japan. Groundwater levels and
   hydraulic head gradients were monitored, simultaneously. In both
   catchments, perennial groundwater was formed within 2 m from the
   locations of spring discharge, wheareas areas more than 6 m unslope from
   the springs were only temporarily saturated during storm periods. In the
   upslope area, hydraulic head gradients indicated the dominance of
   downward water flux within the soil layers. The estimated mean residence
   times of soil waters (0-27 days) and the transient groundwater (TGW) in
   the unslope area (23-67) were related to the sampling depths, regardless
   of the upslope contributing area. The mean residence times of perennial
   groundwater (PGW:93 and 179 days) was significantly longer than TGW,
   independent of sampling depths. The mean residence times of baseflow
   stream (> 1 year) was more than twice that of PGW even though the stream
   was sampled only 5 m downslope from the sampling well of PGW. These
   results indicated that mean residence times of soil water and TGW were
   mostly described by soil depth, whereas, PGW and stream water, which
   were strongly affected by water flow through bedrock, can be described
   by the unslope contributing area. The results also demonstrated that the
   transit times for the lateral water movement through bedrock were
   significantly greater than those for vertical movement of water through
   the soil. These results showed that the aforementioned hypothesis cannot
   be applied for most areas of catchments and instead indicated that mean
   residence times of water can be described either by soil depth or
   unslope contributing area. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A new method based on an extension to time-area (TA) concept is proposed
   for rainfall-runoff transformation in watersheds, The method uses time
   variable isochrones, such that the runoff hydrograph responds well to
   temporal changes in excess rainfall intensity. The method employs a
   kinematic-based travel time scheme, which improves existing isochrone
   extraction techniques. A raster-based approach deals with spatial domain
   discretization and supports rainfall-runoff simulations in a modular
   distributed model. The model uses digital elevation model (DEM) data,
   ground slope, flow direction, and flow accumulation maps to characterize
   the watershed terrain. The time series of travel time (or isochrones)
   maps constitute the basis for incremental and total runoff hydrograph
   computations. The model was calibrated and validated on a small
   catchment. The methods and modeling algorithms extend the original TA
   routing method to a distributed terrain-driven, hydraulic-based, and
   GIS-compatible technique where isochrones vary as the storm intensity
   and infiltration rate develop. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The following basins in the northern area of China are selected as the
   case study areas; the Yellow River. the Haihe River, the Liaohe River,
   and the Songhuajiang River. Qualitative and Qualitative analyses of the
   impact of human activity on river runoff in different spatio-temporal
   scales, including daily. monthly, annual. inter-decade. inter-century
   variations, according to long-term observation data. are carried out,
   The driving, forces of annual runoff change in those rivers are also
   analyzed. It can be seen from observed data that the quantity of
   downstream flow in the northern part of China depends on precipitation
   over a catchment and withdrawal front the upstream. River runoff has a
   tendency towards decrease in terms of a natural basin as well as in
   terms of an administrative region. Besides the climatic changes, the
   increase fit the amount of water taken from river Course is the direct
   cause why observed runoff decreases in the northern part of China, The
   frequency at which minor daily discharge appears, increases rapidly.
   Annual mean runoff generated front the same order of precipitation fit
   1980,,, arid 1990s decreases by 20-50\% as compared in 1950s and 1960s.
   The impact of human activity on river discharge is more in arid or
   semi-arid areas than in humid areas. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The absence of guidelines for pre-selecting the most effective
   combination of properties for inclusion in a composite fingerprint
   represents a key methodological uncertainty hampering the wider adoption
   of the fingerprinting approach for uncertain identifying suspended
   sediment sources. This contribution reports a preliminary attempt to
   address this issue by testing the discrimination of potential sediment
   sources within a number of contrasting river basins in the UK and
   Africa. afforded by a range of sediment properties. Statistical analysis
   confirms that there is no single diagnostic property capable of'
   discriminating the range of potential suspended sediment sources in the
   study basins, The use of composite fingerprints based on several
   constituents drawn from a single group of properties consistently
   improves sediment source discrimination, However, the level of
   discrimination afforded by a particular combination of properties is not
   consistent between the study catchments. Composite fingerprints
   incorporating constituents selected from several groups of Properties
   using, a stepwise statistical selection procedure consistently provide
   the most robust discrimination of' potential sediment Source,,. Whilst
   it is not possible to identify a Universally applicable Optimum
   Composite fingerprint, the results Suggest that at present, the most
   effective means of optimising sediment source discrimination is to
   identify a number of groups of properties tor subsequent use in the
   establishment of a composite fingerprint. More specifically. this study
   suggests that measurement of a combination of acid and
   pyrophosphate-dithionite extractable metals. base cations and organic
   constituents should provide an effective basis for establishing
   composite fingerprints for discriminating individual sediment source
   types. Radiometric properties can also provide useful information for
   improving sediment Source discrimination. The final choice of' the
   groups of properties will necessarily reflect the laboratory facilities
   available. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   respiration) are needed to quantify biotic and abiotic reaction rates in
   unsaturated zones and to gain insight into the importance of these
   processes on global warming. The use of three techniques (dynamic closed
   chambers, static chambers, and gradient calculations) to determine soil
   respiration was assessed by measuring fluxes of microbially produced CO2
   from an unsaturated mesocosm (2.4 m dia. x 3.2 m thick) and two
   unsaturated minicosms (0.58 m dia. x 1.2 m thick), one maintained at
   18-23 degreesC (HT) and the other at 5 degreesC (LT). By injecting known
   and constant CO2 fluxes into the bottom of the HT minicosm and measuring
   the resulting fluxes, it was shown that the dynamic closed chamber
   (DCCS) technique yielded accurate measurements of fluxes over the range
   observed from natural unsaturated media. Over this same range, results
   showed that the concentration gradient method yielded reasonable
   estimates of fluxes but its accuracy was limited by uncertainties in
   both the concentration gradient and the gaseous diffusion coefficient in
   the soil atmosphere. The static chamber method underestimated the actual
   flux at higher CO2 fluxes and when adsorption times of >24 h were used.

Abstract = {{A field test and analysis method has been developed to estimate the
   vertical distribution of hydraulic conductivity in shallow
   unconsolidated aquifers. The field method uses fluid injection ports and
   pressure transducers in a hollow auger that measure the hydraulic head
   outside the auger at several distances from the injection point. A
   constant injection rate is maintained for a duration time sufficient for
   the system to become steady state. Exploiting the analogy between
   electrical resistivity in geophysics and hydraulic flow two methods are
   used to estimate conductivity with depth: a half-space model based on
   spherical flow from a point injection at each measurement site, and a
   one-dimensional inversion of an entire dataset.
   The injection methodology, conducted in three separate drilling
   operations, was investigated for repeatability, reproducibility,
   linearity, and for different injection sources. Repeatability tests,
   conducted at 10 levels, demonstrated standard deviations of generally
   less than 10\%. Reproducibility tests conducted in three, closely spaced
   drilling operations generally showed a standard deviation of less than
   20\%, which is probably due to lateral variations in hydraulic
   conductivity. Linearity tests, made to determine dependency on flow
   rates, showed no indication of a flow rate bias. In order to obtain
   estimates of the hydraulic conductivity by an independent means, a
   series of measurements were made by injecting water through screens
   installed at two separate depths in a monitoring pipe near the
   measurement site. These estimates differed from the corresponding
   estimates obtained by injection in the hollow auger by a factor of less
   than 3.5, which can be attributed to variations in geology and the
   inaccurate estimates of the distance between the measurement and the
   injection sites at depth. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of this Study was to characterise fine scale patterns of organic
   soil moisture content in the top 5 cm by means of semi-variogram
   modelling. Soil moisture content was observed along a transect on 2
   occasions, early in the 1999 growing season to avoid any influences
   originating from vegetation and cultural practices. Soil moisture values
   were found to be normally distributed and were not significantly
   correlated with the soil organic matter content. Many similarities were
   depicted between the exponential semi-variograms characteristics of this
   study and another one in mineral soils, reported in the literature,
   except for the much higher sills associated with organic soils. Of
   particular interest were similar correlation lengths, indicating that a
   correlation range of the order of 100 m should be expected for mineral
   soils and for the level of moisture and organic matter contents found in
   this study. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Isotopic variations in melting snow are poorly understood. We made
   weekly measurements at the Central Sierra Snow Laboratory, California,
   of snow temperature. density, water equivalent and liquid water volume
   to examine how physical changes within the snowpack govern meltwater
   delta(18)O. Snow,pack samples were extracted at 0.1 m intervals from
   ground level to the top of the snowpack profile between December 1991
   and April 1992. Approximately 800 mm of precipitation fell during the
   study period with delta(18)O values between -21.35 and -4.25parts per
   thousand. Corresponding snowpack delta(18)O ranged from -22.25 to
   -6.25parts per thousand. The coefficient of variation of delta(18)O in
   snowpack levels decreased from -0.37 to -0.07 from winter to spring,
   indicating isotopic snowpack homogenization. Meltwater delta(18)O ranged
   from -15.30 to -8.05parts per thousand, with variations of up to
   2.95parts per thousand observed within a single snowmelt episode,
   highlighting the need for frequent sampling. Early snowmelt originated
   in the lower snowpack with higher delta(18)O through ground heat flux
   and rainfall. After the snowpack became isothermal, infiltrating
   snowmelt displaced the higher delta(18)O liquid in the lower snowpack
   through a piston flow process. Fractionation analysis using a
   two-component mixing model on the isothermal snowpack indicated that
   delta(18)O in the initial and final half of major snowmelt was 1.30parts
   per thousand lower and 1.45parts per thousand higher, respectively, than
   the value from simple mixing. Mean snowpack delta(18)O on individual
   profiling days showed a steady increase from -15.15 to -12.05parts per
   thousand due to removal of lower delta(18)O snowmelt and addition of
   higher delta(18)O rainfall. Results suggest that direct sampling of
   snowmelt and snow cores should be undertaken to quantify tracer input
   compositions adequately. The snowmelt sequence also suggests that
   regimes of early lower delta(18)O and later higher delta(18)O melt may
   be modeled and used in catchment tracing studies. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper develops mass fraction models for transport and fate of
   agricultural pollutants in structured two-region soils. Mass fraction
   index models. based on a semi-infinite domain solution. are derived that
   describe leaching at depth, vapor losses through soil surface,
   absorption, and degradation in the dynamic- and stagnant-water soil
   regions. The models predict that leaching is the result of the combined
   effect of the upward vapor-phase transport relative to downward
   advection, residence time relative to half-life, dispersion, and lateral
   diffusive mass transfer. Simulations show, that leached fraction of
   volatile compounds does not always decrease monotonically with increased
   residence time relative to the pollutant half-life, as a result of
   complex interactions among the different physical and biochemical
   processes. The results show that leaching, volatilization, and
   degradation losses can be affected significantly by lateral diffusive
   mass transfer into immobile-water regions and advection relative to
   dispersion (i.e. Peclet number) in the mobile-water regions. It is shown
   that solute diffusion into the immobile phase and subsequent biochemical
   decay reduces leaching and vapor losses through soil surface. Potential
   use of the modified leaching index for the screening of selected
   pesticides is illustrated for different soil textures and infiltration
   rates. The analysis may be useful to the management of pesticides and
   the design of landfills. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The non-linear solvers in numerical solutions of water flow in variably
   saturated soils are prone to convergence difficulties. Many aspects can
   give rise to such difficulties and in this paper we address the gravity
   term and the prescribed-flux boundary in the Picard iteration. The
   problem of the gravity term in the Picard iteration is
   iteration-to-iteration oscillation as the gravity term is treated, by
   analogy with the time-step advance technique, `explicitly' in the
   iteration. The proposed method for the gravity term is an improvement of
   the `implicit' approach of Zhang and Ewen {[}Water Resour. Res. 36
   (2000) 2777] by extending it to heterogeneous soil and approximating the
   inter-nodal hydraulic conductivity in the diffusive term and the gravity
   term with the same scheme. The prescribed-flux boundary in traditional
   methods also gives rise to iteration-to-iteration oscillation because
   there is no feedback to the flux in the solution at the new iteration.
   To reduce such oscillation, a new method is proposed to provide such a
   feedback to the flux. Comparison with traditional Picard and Newton
   iteration methods for a wide range of problems show that a combination
   of these two proposed methods greatly improves the stability and
   consequently the computational efficiency, making the use of small time
   step and/or under-relaxation solely for convergence unnecessary. (C)

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the coupled transport of dissolved constituents
   and particulates, from their infiltration on a Karst plateau to their
   discharge from a karst spring and their arrival at a well in an alluvial
   plain, Particulate markers were identified and the transport of solids
   was characterised in situ in porous and karstic media, based on particle
   size analyses, SEM, and traces. Transport from the sinkhole to the
   spring appeared to be dominated by flow through karst: particulate
   transport was apparently conservative between the two sites, and there
   was little difference in the overall character of the particle size
   distribution of the particulates infiltrating the sinkhole and of those
   discharging from the spring. Qualitatively, the mineralogy of the
   infiltrating and discharging material was similar, although at the
   spring an autochthonous contribution from die aquifer was noted (chalk
   particles eroded from the parent rock by weathering). In contrast,
   transport between the spring and the well appears to be affected by the
   overlying alluvium: particles in the water from the well, showed
   evidence of considerable size-sorting. Additionally, SEM images of the
   well samples showed the presence of particles originating from the
   overlying alluvial system; these particles were not found in samples
   from the sinkhole or the spring. The differences between the
   particulates discharging from the spring and the well indicate that the
   water pumped from the alluvial plain is coming from the Karst aquifer
   via the very transmissive, complex geologic interface between the
   underlying chalk formation and the gravel at the base of the overlying
   alluvial system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{On the basis of one-dimensional theoretical water flow model, we
   demonstrate that the groundwater level variation follows a pattern
   similar to recharge fluctuation, with a time delay that depends on the
   characteristics of aquifer, recharge pattern as well as the distance
   between the recharge and observation locations. On the basis of a water
   budget model and the groundwater flow model, we propose an empirical
   model that links climatic variables to groundwater level. The empirical
   model is tested using a partial data set from historical records of
   water levels from more than 80 wells in a monitoring network for the
   carbonate rock aquifer, southern Manitoba, Canada. The testing results
   show that the predicted groundwater levels are very close to the
   observed ones in most cases. The overall average correlation coefficient
   between the predicted and observed water levels is 0.92. This proposed
   empirical statistical model could be used to predict variations in
   groundwater level in response to different climate scenarios in a
   climate change impact assessment. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published by

Abstract = {{We infer information about the nature of groundwater flow within a karst
   aquifer from the physical and chemical response of a spring to storm
   events. The spring discharges from the Maynardville Limestone in Bear
   Creek Valley, Tennessee. Initially, spring discharge peaks approximately
   1-2 h from the midpoint of summer storms. The initial peak is likely due
   to surface loading, which pressurizes the aquifer and results in water
   moving out of storage. All of the storms monitored exhibited recessions
   that follow a master recession curve very closely, indicating that storm
   response is fairly consistent and repeatable, independent of the time
   between storms and the configuration of the rain event itself.
   Electrical conductivity initially increases for 0.5-2.9 days (longer for
   smaller storms), the result of moving older water out of storage. This
   is followed by a 2.1-2.5 day decrease in conductivity, resulting from an
   increasing portion of low conductivity recharge water entering the
   spring. Stable carbon isotope data and the calcite saturation index of
   the spring water also support this conceptual model. Spring flow is
   likely controlled by displaced water from the aquifer rather than by
   direct recharge through the soil zone. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Stable isotope data of surface waters from the humid tropics in general,
   and Costa Rica in particular, are scarce. To improve our understanding
   of the spatial distribution of stable isotopes in surface waters, we
   measured delta(18)O and deltaD in river and lake (n = 63) and
   precipitation (n = 3) samples from Costa Rica. We also present data from
   the IAEA/WMO isotopes in precipitation network as context for our study.
   Surface water isotope values do not strongly correlate with elevation,
   stream head elevation, stream length, distance from Caribbean Sea, or
   estimated mean annual precipitation for the country as a whole. However,
   the data show distinct regional trends. The delta(18)O and deltaD values
   downwind of mountain ranges are inversely related to the altitude of the
   ranges the air masses traverse. In the lee of the high Talamanca Range,
   delta(18)O values are similar to6-8parts per thousand lower, while in
   the lee of the lower Tilaran Range delta(18)O values are 2-3parts per
   thousand lower than upwind sites along the Caribbean Slope. An altitude
   effect of -1.4parts per thousand delta(18)O/km is present on the Pacific
   slope of southern Costa Rica, equivalent to a temperature effect of
   -0.3parts per thousand degreesC. The Nicoya and Osa Peninsulas have
   higher values than upwind sites, suggesting input of Pacific-sourced
   moisture, evaporative enrichment, or decreased condensation
   temperatures. Elevated and increasing d-excess values inland along the
   Nicaragua Trough suggest a recycled component may be an important
   contributor to the water budget. These data provide preliminary stable
   isotope information for Costa Rica, and will benefit paleoclimatic
   research in the region. More detailed studies would be beneficial to our
   understanding of the controls on stable isotope composition of tropical
   waters. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Information regarding dew deposition on the stone-covered surface is
   scarce. The effects of gravel and sand mulches on dew condensation were
   studied during the late summer and fall of 1999 in the semiarid loess
   region of China. The results indicated that there were significant
   difference in daily dew amount between gravel mulch, sand mulch and dry
   loess soil (control). The average dew amount for gravel mulch was 0.071
   mm d(-1) with extreme 0.022 and 0.20 mm d(-1). The average values for
   sand mulch and dry loess soil was 0.12 and 0.15 mm d(-1), respectively.
   The minimum dew amount was 0.048 mm d(-1) for sand mulch and 0.071 mm
   d(-1) for dry loess soil, and the maximum dew amount was approximate
   0.25 mm d(-1) for both treatments. The results suggest that surface
   stone mulch can re(C)duce dew deposition as compared to sand and dry
   loess soil. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the impact of climate change on water resources
   in southern Taiwan. The upstream catchment of Shin-Fa Bridge station in
   the Kao-Pen Creek basin was the study area chosen herein. The historical
   trends of meteorological variables, such as mean daily temperature, mean
   daily precipitation on wet days, monthly wet days, and the transition
   probabilities of daily precipitation occurrence in each month, at the
   Kao-Hsiung meteorological station, near the catchments were detected
   using a non-parametric statistical test. The trends of these
   meteorological variables were then employed to generate runoff in future
   climatic conditions using a continuous rainfall a-runoff model. The
   analytical results indicate that the transition probabilities of daily
   precipitation occurrence significantly influence precipitation
   generation, and generated runoff for future climatic conditions in
   southern Taiwan was found to rise during the wet season and decline
   during the dry season. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{There are two basic approaches for estimating flood quantiles: a
   parametric and a nonparametric method. In this study, the comparisons of
   parametric and nonparametric models for annual maximum flood data of
   Goan gauging station in Korea were performed based on Monte Carlo
   simulation. In order to consider uncertainties that can arise from model
   and data errors, kernel density estimation for fitting the sampling
   distributions was chosen to determine safety factors (SFs) that depend
   on the probability model used to fit the real data. The relative biases
   of Sheater and Jones plug-in (SJ) are the smallest in most cases among
   seven bandwidth selectors applied. The relative root mean square errors
   (RRMSEs) of the Gumbel (GUM) are smaller than those of any other models
   regardless of parent models considered. When ale Weibull-2 is assumed as
   a parent model. the RRMSEs of kernel density estimation are relatively
   small, while those of kernel density estimation are much bigger than
   those of parametric methods for other parent models. However, the RRMSEs
   of kernel density estimation within interpolation range are much smaller
   than those for extrapolation range in comparison with those of
   parametric methods. Among the applied distributions, the GUM model has
   the smallest SFs for all parent models, and the general extreme value
   model has the largest values for all parent models considered. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Different opinions exist regarding the specific effect of Mg on soil
   physical and chemical properties, We hypothesized that Mg2+, compared
   with Ca2+, reduces saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) via promoting
   clay swelling, disaggregation, and clay dispersion. Two soils (mixed,
   mesic Typic Hapludalfs) in packed soil columns were leached with either
   Ca- or Mg-containing solutions at the successive concentrations of 250,
   10, 2, 0.5, and 0 mM. Critical flocculation concentration (CFC) in
   either Ca or Mg systems was determined with flocculation series tests.
   Aggregate stability and mean weight diameter (MWD) were assessed by
   wet-sieving. The CFCs were higher in Mg than in Ca for both soils,
   indicating that Mg is more dispersive than Ca. The MWDs measured using
   1-2 mm aggregates of both soils were significantly larger for Ca-soils
   than for Mg-soils (P = 0.05). The K-sr (normalized with initial K-s)
   started to decline at higher concentrations for Mg than for Ca, and the
   reduction was much greater in Mg than in Ca above 0.5 mM. The K-sr and
   percent transmittance (inversely related to turbidity) of leachate at a
   given eluted pore volume following `steady state' were higher in Ca than
   in Mg for both soils (P = 0.1), indicating lower permeability and more
   clay dispersion with the Mg treatment. Swelling and disaggregation,
   which reduced large pores, appeared to be the dominant process causing
   the rapid initial decline of K-sr Clay dispersion and subsequent pore
   plugging became progressively important when electrolyte concentration
   was reduced to below CFCs. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{For the purpose of increasing the amount of ground water recharge, we
   investigated the hydraulic characteristics of water infiltration in a
   flooded paddy rice field in Ten-Chung, Chung-Hwa county, Taiwan.
   Experimental results based on mini-tensiometers and double ring
   infiltrometer measurements indicated that the least permeable layer
   occurred at the interface of the puddled topsoil and non-puddled
   subsoil. The average thickness of this layer was about 7.5 cm and
   saturated hydraulic conductivity ranged from 0.034 to 0.083 cm/day.
   Vertical infiltration flow was saturated within the plow sole layer and
   became unsaturated in the subsoil below the plow sole layer. The
   hydraulic conductivity of the subsoil, 20-30 times greater than that of
   the plow sole layer, revealed that the subsoil was more permeable than
   the plow sole layer. In situ measurements also demonstrated that
   breakage of the plow sole layer increased infiltration rate by a factor
   of 3.7. Increasing ponded water depth from 6 to 16 cm increased
   infiltration 1.5 fold. It is suggested that using the fallow paddy rice
   fields without puddling is a feasible way to enhance groundwater
   recharge, but for cultivated paddy rice fields, breaking the plow sole
   needs further study in terms of its recoverability and because of the
   potential contamination of the shallow aquifer by agrocheimicals. The
   experimental data can be applied in numerical simulation models to
   quantify detailed water movement mechanisms and accurately estimate the
   amount of ground water recharge in paddy rice fields. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the sensitivity of distributed hydrological models
   to different patterns that account for the spatial distribution of
   rainfall: spatially averaged rainfall or rainfall field. The rainfall
   data come from a dense network of recording rain gauges that cover
   approximately 2000 km(2) around Mexico City. The reference rain sample
   accounts for the 50 most significant events, whose mean duration is
   about 10 h and maximal point depth 170 mm. Three models were tested
   using different runoff production models: storm-runoff coefficient,
   complete or partial interception. These models were then applied to four
   fictitious homogeneous basins, whose sizes range front 20 to 1500 km(2).
   For each test, the sensitivity of the model is expressed as the relative
   differences between the empirical distribution of the peak flows (and
   runoff volumes), calculated according to the two patterns of rainfall
   input: uniform or non-uniform. Differences in flows range from 10 to
   80\%, depending on the type of runoff production model used, the size of
   the basin and the return period of the event. The differences are
   generally moderate for extreme events. In the local context, this means
   that uniform design rainfall combining point rainfall distribution and
   the probabilistic concept of the areal reduction factor could be
   sufficient to estimate major flood probability. Differences are more
   significant for more frequent events. This can generate problems in
   calibrating the hydrological model when spatial rainfall localization is
   not taken into account: a bias in the estimation of parameters makes
   their physical interpretation difficult and leads to overestimation of
   extreme flows. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Northern Guam Lens Aquifer is an island karst aquifer in uplifted
   young, highly conductive limestone. Calculations of recharge based on
   differences between daily rainfall and daily pan evaporation suggest
   that the maximum annual mass of water delivered to the freshwater lens
   is about 67\% of mean annual rainfall. Hydrographs of daily well-level
   responses plotted against daily rainfall indicate that the rate at which
   water is delivered to the lens is a function of rainfall intensity and
   the relative saturation of the vadose zone. Together, these variables
   determine the degree to which stormwater is shunted into fast flow
   through preferred pathways that bypass the bedrock matrix, rather than
   percolating slowly through the bedrock matrix.
   Data from the 40-year interval from 1956 to 1995 show that some 17\% of
   rainfall on northern Guam arrives in small amounts (<0.6 cm/day). Most
   of this light rainfall is probably lost to evapotranspiration. At least
   another 20\% of total rainfall on Guam arrives at very high intensities
   (>5.0 cm/day), which tend to promote fast flow at the expense of
   percolation. Rapid recovery of the water table from rapid recharge
   suggests that the lens either takes such recharge into storage very
   rapidly, discharges it rapidly without taking it into storage, or some
   combination of both. Significant vadose buffering of recharge to the
   lens is indicated by the fact that simulations assuming that the
   recharge from precipitation received in any given month is transmitted
   to the lens during the same month consistently over-predict observed
   peak mean monthly water levels and under-predict the minima. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Analyses of independent laboratory- and field-scale measurements from
   two sites on Sapelo Island, Georgia reveal heterogeneity in hydraulic
   parameters across the upland-estuary interface. Regardless of the method
   used (short-duration pumping tests, amplitude attenuation of tidal
   pumping data, sediment grain size distributions, and falling head
   permeameter tests), we obtain hydraulic conductivity of similar to10(-4)
   m s(-1) for the fine-grained, well-sorted, clean sands that make up the
   upland areas. Proximal to the upland-estuary boundary, the tidal pumping
   analyses and permeameter tests suggest that hydraulic conductivities
   decrease by more than two orders of magnitude, a result consistent with
   the presence of a clogging layer. Such a clogging layer may arise due to
   a variety of physical, chemical, or biological processes. The extent and
   orientation of the layers of reduced hydraulic conductivity near the
   upland-estuary boundary influence the nature of the aquifer's response
   to tidal forcing. Where the lower conductivity layer forms a relatively
   flat creek bank, tidal pumping produces a primarily mechanical response
   in the adjacent aquifer. Where the creek bank is nearly vertical, there
   is a more direct hydraulic connection between the tidal creek and the
   adjacent aquifer. The clogging layer likely contributes to the
   development of complicated flow pathways across the upland-estuary
   boundary. Effective flow paths calculated from tidal pumping data
   terminate within the marsh, beyond the boundary of the upland aquifer,
   suggesting a diffuse regime of groundwater discharge in the marsh. We
   postulate that, in many settings, submarsh flow may be as important as
   seepage faces for groundwater discharge into the marsh-estuary complex.

Abstract = {{We examine the feasibility of retrieving root zone soil moisture and
   partitioning of surface fluxes through a model inversion technique using
   surface measurements. Using a four-layer land surface model and observed
   datasets from Field Experiment (FIFE) 1987, we show that the
   sensitivities of surface soil moisture to deeper layer soil moisture are
   different to those of surface fluxes. Consequently, if one chooses the
   initial soil moisture profile that optimizes surface soil moisture. in a
   root mean square error sense, it may not lead to optimal estimation of
   surface fluxes. We also show that the accuracy of soil moisture profile
   retrieval from surface measurements depends strongly on the initial
   surface soil moisture conditions. For wetter surface conditions, an
   initialization based on remotely sensed surface soil moisture appears to
   be adequate for the retrieval of the soil moisture profile. For drier
   surface conditions. however, a decoupling of surface and deeper layer
   soil moisture might be triggered and an initialization based on surface
   soil moisture would lead to larger error. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{In this paper, the applicability of Richards' equation for water flow
   and the convection-dispersion equation for solute transport is evaluated
   to model field-scale flow and transport under natural boundary
   conditions by using detailed experimental data and inverse optimization.
   The data consisted of depth-averaged time series of water content.
   pressure head and resident solute concentration data measured several
   times a day during 384 d. In a first approach, effective parameters are
   estimated using the time series for one depth and assuming a homogeneous
   soil profile. In a second approach, all time series were used
   simultaneously to estimate the parameters of a multi-layered soil
   profile. Water flow was described by the Richards' equation and solute
   transport either by the equilibrium convection-dispersion (CDE) or the
   physical non-equilibrium convection-dispersion (MIM) equation. To
   represent the dynamics of the water content and pressure head data, the
   multi-layered soil profile approach gave better results. Fitted soil
   hydraulic parameters were comparable with parameters obtained with other
   methods on the same soil. At larger depths, both the CDE- and MIM-models
   gave acceptable descriptions of the observed breakthrough data, although
   the MIM performed somewhat better in the tailing part. Both models
   underestimated significantly the fast breakthrough. To describe the
   breakthrough curves at the first depth, only the MIM with a mixing layer
   close to the soil surface gave acceptable results. Starting from an
   initial value problem with solutes homogeneously distributed over the
   mobile and immobile water phase was preferable compared to the
   incorporation of a small layer with only mobile water near the soil
   surface. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose to deepen the interpretation of combined geophysical methods
   (georadar. seismic and electric) to assess physical properties
   characterizing the near-surface porous formations. especially the
   influence of water. Velocity analysis of multioffset georadar data are
   used together with seismic methods to estimate lateral and vertical
   ground water fluctuations. This enables us to identify transitions from
   non-saturated to fully saturated porous layers with certainty.
   Furthermore, the accurate knowledge of seismic velocities helps to
   estimate the porosity of the ground water formations. Finally, we show
   how the radar technique may be useful in solving the problem of
   trade-off between bulk resistivity, which is deduced from electrical
   measurements, and that of water ionic conductivity and water content.
   These theoretical considerations are illustrated using various
   measurements conducted at the same test site. Our interpretation is
   compared with a few laboratory measurements on water and soil samples.
   This study displays the impact of combined geophysical approaches for
   providing models of water and ionic transfers down to a depth of several
   metres. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   minimizing the error in representation and analysis when using

Abstract = {{Although not fully adequate. freshwater hydraulic heads have been used
   historically to represent and analyze variable-density flow in sloping
   aquifers in sedimentary basins. The use of environmental heads is valid
   only for strictly vertical flow in unconfined aquifers, while using
   variable-density hydraulic heads contravenes Darcy's law. Although the
   use of hydraulic-head surfaces is the simplest and quickest means of
   flow analysis and interpretation, preceding other methods such as
   numerical modeling, it introduces some errors that should be assessed
   and minimized in order to provide the most accurate flow representation.
   A first error is introduced when approximating the potential and
   buoyancy components along aquifer slope of the flow-driving force with
   their projections onto the horizontal plane. This error is most probably
   negligibly small for sloping aquifers in undisturbed sedimentary basins.
   but may be significant for aquifers dipping at a significant angle, such
   as in folded strata. A second error is introduced when using only
   hydraulic heads in the representation and analysis. and neglecting the
   buoyancy component of the flow-driving force. The significance of this
   error can be assessed by performing a Driving Force Ratio (DFR)
   analysis. There is no single or critical value of the DFR, below which
   the error in using hydraulic heads alone is negligible, and above which
   it is not acceptable anymore: rather, the decision regarding the error
   acceptability should and can be made on a case by case basis. The DFR,
   hence the errors in flow direction and magnitude, can be minimized for
   any given aquifer by using an optimum reference density in
   hydraulic-head calculations that is the areally-weighted average density
   of formation water in that aquifer. In flow analyses based on

Abstract = {{The Permian Salado Formation in the Delaware Basin of New Mexico is an
   extensively studied evaporite deposit because it is the host formation
   for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), a repository for transuranic
   wastes. Geologic and hydrologic studies of the Salado conducted since
   the mid-1970s have led to the development of a conceptual model of the
   hydrogeology of the formation that involves far-field (i.e. beyond the
   disturbance created by the repository) permeability in anhydrite layers
   and at least some impure halite layers. Pure halite layers and some
   impure halite layers may not possess an interconnected pore network
   adequate to provide permeability. Pore pressures are probably very close
   to lithostatic pressure. In the near field around an excavation.
   dilation. creep, and shear have created and/or enhanced permeability and
   decreased pore pressure. Whether flow occurs in the far field under
   natural gradients or only after some threshold gradient is reached is
   unknown. If far-field flow does occur, mean pore velocities are probably
   on the order of a meter per hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of
   years.
   Most hydraulic-test responses in the Salado do not appear to reflect
   radial flow, but instead imply subradial (e.g. intermediate between
   linear and radial) flow dimensions. We believe these subradial
   dimensions reflect channeling of flow through fracture networks. or
   portions of fractures. that occupy a diminishing proportion of the
   radially available space, or through percolation networks that are not
   `saturated' (percolation terminology meaning fully interconnected). This
   is probably related to the directional nature of the permeability
   created or enhanced by excavation effects. Inferred values of
   permeability cannot be separated from their associated flow dimensions.
   Therefore, numerical models of flow and transport should include
   heterogeneity that is structured to provide the same flow dimensions as
   are observed in hydraulic tests. Modeling of the Salado Formation around
   the WIPP repository should also include coupling between hydraulic
   properties and the evolving stress field because hydraulic properties
   change as the stress field changes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{An urban fractured-rock aquifer system, where disposal of storm water is
   via `soak holes' drilled directly into the top of fractured-rock basalt,
   has a highly dynamic nature where theories or knowledge to generate the
   model are still incomplete and insufficient. Therefore, formulating an
   accurate mechanistic model, usually based on first principles (physical
   and chemical laws, mass balance, and diffusion and transport, etc.),
   requires time- and money-consuming tasks.
   Instead of a human developing the mechanistic-based model, this paper
   presents an approach to automatic model evolution in genetic programming
   (GP) to model dynamic behaviour of groundwater level fluctuations
   affected by storm water infiltration. This GP evolves mathematical
   models automatically that have an understandable structure using
   function tree representation by methods of natural selection ('survival
   of the fittest') through genetic operators (reproduction, crossover. and
   mutation).
   The simulation results have shown that GP is not only capable of
   predicting the groundwater level fluctuation due to storm water
   infiltration but also provides insight into the dynamic behaviour of a
   partially known urban fractured-rock aquifer system by allowing
   knowledge extraction of the evolved models. Our results show that GP can
   work as a cost-effective modelling tool, enabling us to create prototype
   models quickly and inexpensively and assists us in developing accurate
   models in less time, even if we have limited experience and incomplete
   knowledge for an urban fractured-rock aquifer system affected by storm
   water infiltration. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The downstream distribution of channel geometry and of the rate of
   energy expenditure per unit channel area P-a are analyzed on extensive
   datasets from the Ashley and Taieri Rivers in New Zealand. We
   investigate whether the rivers conform to local optimality, by which P-a
   tends to be constant throughout the network. We look at energy
   expenditure from two perspectives. (1) In the context of downstream
   hydraulic geometry (DHG) relations, we derive equations for the general
   unconstrained optimal combination of the DHG exponents h and f under
   local optimality, and compare these with data-derived exponents from the
   Ashley and Taieri Rivers. (2) Treating P-a as a random variable. we
   examine the downstream scaling of moments of P-a. Results suggest that
   E(P-a) is constant in the higher order stream network in both basins.
   The scaling of Var(P-a) with discharge illustrates that basin and
   channel heterogeneity play an important role in understanding the
   spatial distribution of energy expenditure and its variability in river
   systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A number of short-term variable discharge pumping tests were conducted
   on sloping fault zones cutting serpentinites from a thrust complex in
   north Portugal. The fault zones were identified and geometrically
   characterized by geological mapping, interpretation of aerial
   photographs and electromagnetic survey. The evolution of specific
   drawdowns obeyed two different laws: (1) specific drawdown-time points
   fitted to straight lines in log-linear scatter plots. In these cases,
   test data were interpreted by the Cooper-Jacob method, as if fault zones
   were regular confined porous media aquifers, (2) specific drawdown-time
   points fitted to straight lines in bilinear scatter plots. Because the
   available theoretical models were unable to match the observed data. a
   new approach was developed. The approach introduces the concept of
   impermeable barrier with variable effective position, a barrier that is
   represented by the upper limit of the fault zone aquifer. The mechanics
   of the method is still based on the concepts and formulae of confined
   porous media aquifers. including the framework of the image well theory.
   The calculated transmissivities (T = 7 x 10(-7) -2 x 10(-4) m(2)/s) and
   storage coefficients (S = 2 x 10(-5) -6.1 x 10(-4)) are within those
   commonly found for confined aquifers in fractured rocks. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Variations in climate conditions during recent decades in British
   Columbia, Canada have occurred coincident to significant changes in
   streamflow conditions in the province. In the current study. the ability
   of empirical downscaling models to resolve these changes is investigated
   using ensemble neural networks forced with synoptic-scale atmospheric
   conditions. Five-day averages of streamflow data from 21 watersheds in
   the region are modelled using atmospheric data from the NCEP/NCAR
   reanalysis project as inputs. Ability of the downscaling models to
   predict streamflow and changes in streamflow between 19751986 and
   1987-1998 is evaluated using a combination of model performance
   statistics, comparisons between long-term averages, and results from
   non-parametric statistical tests. \textbackslash{}
   While performance varied between systems, results suggest that empirical
   downscaling models for streamflow are capable of predicting changes in
   streamflow observed during recent decades using only large-scale
   atmospheric conditions as model inputs. Based on comparisons between
   stepwise linear regression and neural network models. the latter
   approach is recommended, particularly when trying to model systems with
   complex non-linear and interactive relationships between inputs and
   outputs. The use of ensemble averaging as a part of the modelling
   process is investigated and a number of recommendations are made with
   respect to this methodology. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An area differentiated water balance analysis in the river Elbe basin
   (German part) for the hydrological period 1961-1990 was carried out
   using the GROWA98 model. The mean long-term total runoff was modelled as
   a function of the regional interaction of the site conditions climate,
   soil, geology, topography and land use. The total runoff was separated
   into the direct runoff (interflow and surface runoff) and groundwater
   runoff (base flow) using base-flow indices, depending on area
   characteristics (e.g. geology, depth for groundwater). In this way, the
   regional dominant runoff components. i.e, pathways for the displacement
   of nutrients from soil to surface water were identified. The model
   results were validated by comparing the calculated runoff levels with
   measured data from 120 sub-basins of the river Elbe-catchment area. In
   general, the differences between modelled and measured runoff values
   were less than 15\%, indicating the reliability of the chosen procedure.
   This allows further model applications, e.g. for the quantification of
   the diffuse nutrient input into groundwater and surface waters
   differentiated to the runoff components. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{The potential impacts of the future climate change on the causes of
   flood flows were investigated for two mountainous watersheds located in
   two different climatic regions of British Columbia. The Canadian Centre
   for Climate Modeling Analysis General Circulation Model (CGCMa1) has
   been used to estimate changes in the precipitation and temperature. The
   UBC Watershed Model (Version 4,0) was used to simulate the discharge of
   the two study watersheds and to identify the causes of peak flows. In
   the simulations, apart from changes in precipitation and temperature,
   changes in the spatial distribution of precipitation with elevation,
   cloud cover, glacier extension, vegetation distribution, vegetation
   biomass production. and plant physiology were considered. The results
   showed that the future climate for the two study watersheds would be
   wetter and warmer than the present climate. The majority of the flood
   events in the coastal rainfed watershed of Upper Campbell are and would
   be generated by fall rainfall events and winter rain-on-snow events,
   whereas in the interior snowcovered Illecillewaet basin the floods are
   and would be produced by spring rain and snowmelt events and summer
   events. The analysis indicated that the overall flood magnitude and
   frequency of occurrence in the Upper Campbell watershed would increase.
   On the other hand, the number and the magnitude of the flood flows would
   decrease under the future climatic conditions in the Illecillewaet
   basin. Based on these findings, different management practices should be
   applied in the two watersheds to overcome the effects of the future
   climate change. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A time series forecasting model of hourly water consumption 24 h in
   advance for an urban zone within the Melbourne (Australia) water supply
   system is developed. The model comprises two modules-daily and hourly.
   The daily module is formulated as a set of equations representing the
   effects of three factors on water use namely seasonality, climatic
   correlation, and autocorrelation. The hourly module is developed to
   disaggregate the estimated daily consumption into hourly consumption.
   The models were calibrated using hourly and daily data for a 6 year
   period, and independently validated over an additional seven month
   period. Over this latter period, the hourly forecast model accounted for
   66\% of the variance in the peak hourly water consumption with a
   standard error of 162 l/p/d. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Based on schematic representations of hydrogeological conditions,
   related to the structure of the formations and topographical features,
   analytical solutions were derived for the behaviour of groundwater
   discharge in terms of a time-variable drainage resistance. This led to a
   general equation of the drainage resistance as a function of groundwater
   discharge. This physically based equation was implemented in a simple
   non-distributed conceptual runoff model in order to analyse continuous
   time series of runoff with intermittent rainfall. Application of the
   model to different physiographic environments. varying from high Alpine
   mountainous catchments to the low lying areas of the Netherlands, showed
   that ignoring the time-variable nature of drainage resistance may lead
   to significant errors in the analysis and prediction of both baseflow
   and direct runoff. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration and management of wetlands rely on a quantitatively based
   understanding of surface-water flow over emergent vegetation. In the
   work reported here, we develop a two-dimensional diffusion model for
   surface-water movement, and we test this model against hydrologic data
   collected from the Shark River Slough of the Florida Everglades. The
   equations that govern the model are derived under the assumption that a
   power-law relationship quantifies the dependence of flow velocity on
   water depth. We simplify the model formulation by assuming uniform rates
   of evaporation. a constant ground-surface slope, and spatially
   homogeneous vegetative cover. Using flow parameters estimated from
   calibration, the model accurately predicts the spatial and temporal
   changes in surface-water levels measured over a 27 km long transect of
   Shark River Slough. The results of this research suggest that good
   predictions of wetland-flow dynamics at large scales can be obtained
   with relatively simple numerical models and without extensive
   characterization of the variability in wetland properties. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The characteristics of single- and multiphase flow through fractured
   rock are of considerable interest in petroleum and natural gas
   exploitation as well as in the risk assessment of underground
   repositories. Flow processes of water and gas were studied in a granite
   core containing a fault gouge filled fracture zone. The pore structure
   of the sample was scanned by X-ray computed tomography (CT).
   A reversible change of fracture aperture due to shrinking and swelling
   of fault gouge was observed when drying, saturating and again drying the
   core. There is evidence that the fractures at the contact between matrix
   and fault gouge contribute most to permeability.
   Changes in the size distribution of water filled pores were monitored by
   low magnetic field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) during miscible
   flooding with deuterated water and immiscible flooding with nitrogen
   gas. Gas breakthrough occurred quickly at extremely low gas saturation
   indicating preferential pathways. Water saturation decreased gradually
   with the increase of injection pressure. In comparison, the process of
   miscible flooding showed a much more homogeneous behavior. Deuterated
   water breakthrough occurred slowly and at higher deuterated water
   saturation. In miscible flooding, the large and small range of the pore
   size distribution decreased simultaneously indicating that deuterated
   water invaded both types of pores at the same time. In the immiscible
   flooding process, the large pores were preferentially invaded by gas. At
   low water saturation, water only fills the very small pores, which do
   not contribute to gas flow. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In many hydrological studies, two non-parametric rank-based statistical
   tests, namely the Mann-Kendall test and Spearman's rho test are used for
   detecting monotonic trends in time series data. However, the power of
   these tests has not been well documented. This study investigates the
   power of the tests by Monte Carlo simulation. Simulation results
   indicate that their power depends on the pre-assigned significance
   level. magnitude of trend. sample size. and the amount of variation
   within a time series. That is. the bigger the absolute magnitude of
   trend. the more powerful are the tests, as the sample size increases,
   the tests become more powerful: and as the amount of variation increases
   within a time series. the power of the tests decrease. When a trend is
   present. the power is also dependent on the distribution type and
   skewness of the time series. The simulation results also demonstrate
   that these two tests have similar power in detecting a trend, to the
   point of being indistinguishable in practice.
   The two tests are implemented to assess the significance of trends in
   annual maximum daily streamflow data of 20 pristine basins in Ontario,
   Canada. Results indicate that the P-values computed by these different
   tests are almost identical. By the binomial distribution. the field
   significant downward trend was assessed at the significance level of
   0.05, Results indicate that a higher number of sites show evidence of
   decreasing trends than one might expect due to chance alone. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The geochemical evolution of groundwaters along a 24 km flow beneath
   Central Mexico City path from the Sierra de las Cruces towards Lake
   Texcoco has been investigated using stable isotopes, radiocarbon and
   major and trace elements to deter-mine the natural baseline conditions,
   the extent of any contamination and the effectiveness of the overlying
   aquitard seal. Modern groundwaters of low salinity (<200 mg l(-1)) are
   found up to 11 km. from the outcrop area and groundwater ages of up to
   6000 yr BP occur in the middle part of the section. Groundwater stable
   isotope ratios 6 180 and 52 H lie close to the Global meteoric water
   line, indicating that the groundwater originates from local rainfall.
   The groundwater chemistry may be interpreted as the result of inputs
   from the source area with progressive water-rock interaction down the
   horizontal flow gradient. A redox boundary is found at 9 km along the
   line of section, coincident with the start of the confined section.
   Relatively low nitrate concentrations (below 9 m l(-1) NO3-N) are found
   in the aerobic waters; low concentrations of NO3 in the aerobic waters
   and low Cl reflect inputs prior to the modern development. Some elements
   (Cr, U, As, Se, Sb) increase their concentration with distance (time) as
   far as the redox boundary, but low concentrations occur in the reducing
   aquifer section. The chemistry of several major ions (Mg, Na/Cl, K) as
   well as trace elements such as Li, Rb, Ba reflect the weathering of the
   basaltic mineral assemblage (feldspars and mafic minerals) and their
   increases are generally proportional to residence time; phosphate, F and
   I concentrations indicate a probable source from apatite in the basaltic
   or rhyolitic rocks. A borehole in the east of the city (some 17 km
   downgradient) intercepted thermal water (Si geothermometry indicates
   163degreesC at depth). This water gives a distinctive composition
   indicating possible addition of metamorphic CO, which has then reacted
   with the igneous rocks. Increases in B and Cl are derived from volatiles
   trapped in the glass or vesicular basalt. A thermal anomaly found in the
   middle section of the heavily pumped aquifer is interpreted as the
   up-coming of warmer water from medium to greater depth mainly from
   basalts, rhyolites and possibly limestones.
   The geochemistry indicates that groundwater beneath Mexico City is of
   good quality and there is no obvious evidence of leakage of inorganic
   compounds from surface sources of contamination through the aquitard.
   The younger groundwater drawn from the western outcrop area is generally
   of good inorganic quality. Increased drawdowns in the confined aquifer
   have induced flow of warmer water with higher Cl from depth. The
   resources in the aquifer represent an important reserve of good quality
   water which need to be properly managed as a high quality resource as
   part of integrated plans for the City's future supplies. (C) 2002 W.M.

Abstract = {{A portable system for bedform-mapping was evaluated in the delta of the
   lower Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, California, from 1998 to 2000.
   Bedform. profiles were surveyed with a two-person crew using an array of
   four single-beam transducers on boats about 6 m in length. Methods for
   processing the bedform profiles into maps with geographic coordinates
   were developed for spreadsheet programs and surface-contouring software.
   Straight reaches were surveyed every few days or weeks to determine
   locations of sand deposition, net transport directions, flow thresholds
   for bedform regimes, and bedform-transport rates. In one channel of
   unidirectional flow, the portable system was used to record changes in
   bedform. regime through minor fluctuations of low discharge, and through
   high discharges near channel capacity. In another channel with reversing
   flows from tides, the portable system recorded directions of net
   bedload-transport that would be undetectable by standard bedload
   sampling alone. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The prediction of a time series using the dynamical systems approach
   requires the knowledge of three parameters; the time delay, the
   embedding dimension and the number of nearest neighbours. In this paper,
   a new criterion, based on the generalized degrees of freedom, for the
   selection of the number of nearest neighbours needed for a better local
   model for time series prediction is presented. The validity of the
   proposed method is examined using time series, which are known to be
   chaotic under certain initial conditions (Lorenz map, Henon map and
   Logistic map), and real hydro meteorological time series (discharge data
   from Chao Phraya river in Thailand, Mekong river in Thailand and Laos,
   and sea surface temperature anomaly data). The predicted results are
   compared with observations, and with similar predictions obtained by
   using arbitrarily fixed numbers of neighbours. The results indicate
   superior predictive capability as measured by the mean square errors and
   coefficients of variation by the proposed approach when compared with
   the traditional approach of using a fixed number of neighbours. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{A runoff routing model, which incorporates a linear routing structure
   and attempts to provide a physically realistic distribution of storage
   effects, has recently been developed. The model with its physically
   realistic storage effects has been shown to provide consistently good
   reproduction of observed large floods without the need for parameter
   fitting or calibration. Storage distribution is determined from a volume
   law that accounts for the distribution of river channel storage in
   natural catchments. The model is briefly described, but the emphasis is
   on demonstrating its ability to reproduce large observed floods and
   design floods in China and Australia. The model results are compared
   with those from two commonly used non-linear storage routing models
   using several measures of performance. The probable maximum floods
   (PMFs) estimated based on all three models are also compared. The linear
   model using the proposed volume law is recommended for estimation of
   design floods because it has been shown to represent the observed
   geomorphological processes more realistically than other models, and
   because it reproduces observed large floods at least as well as the
   other models considered in this study. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Contaminant transport by groundwater in a sloping aquifer is considered
   in the case when contaminant plume has a salinity (and density)
   different from that of the groundwater, and is heat generating. Forced
   convection is present due to regional groundwater flow and natural
   convection is also expected to develop due to concentration differences
   and thermal changes. Such a situation takes place in deep-well disposal
   of liquid radioactive waste, in which the heat generation is caused by
   the radioactive decay.
   Flow and contaminant transport in the aquifer were calculated in 2D
   approximation in the plane of the aquifer, and the process of heat
   conduction in confining rocks was described by a 3D model. The set of
   equations governing flow, heat and mass transfer in the system was
   solved numerically with use of finite differences technique. Accuracy of
   numerical solution was checked by comparison with an original analytical
   solution of the flow problem for concentration-driven convection.
   It was shown that the influence of the natural convection component
   could cause acceleration as well as slowing down of the contaminant
   plume movement depending on system parameters. Results of numerical
   solution were approximated by a dimensionless analytical expression,
   which can be used for estimation of the relative impact of different
   driving forces exerting influence on the contaminant plume movement.

Abstract = {{Relatively few recording raingauges with long reliable records are
   available in South Africa for the estimation of short duration (less
   than or equal to 24 h) design rainfalls. Hence, approaches to estimating
   short duration design rainfalls have been developed for South Africa
   which are based on daily rainfall data measured by standard,
   non-recording raingauges at fixed 24 h periods ending at 08:00. These
   approaches include the use of regional frequency analyses, scaling the
   moments of the extreme events and stochastic modelling of the rainfall
   process (Smithers and Schulze, Development and evaluation of techniques
   for estimating short duration design rainfall in South Africa, WRC
   Report No. 681/1/00, Water Research Commission, Pretoria, RSA, 2000a pp.
   356). In this paper, the methodology of determining the parameters of
   two versions of Bartlett-Lewis Rectangular Pulse Models (BLRP) and a
   comparison of the performance of the models at selected stations is
   presented. The correlation between the parameters of the models is
   illustrated and utilised in better defining parameters and searching for
   appropriate model parameters. The scaling characteristics of rainfall
   are used to estimate the variances for durations <24 h from daily
   rainfall data, which are then used to determine model parameters. An
   assessment of the performance of the models with parameters determined
   using readily available daily rainfall data, and with shorter duration
   statistics inferred from the daily data, is presented for selected
   research sites where the short duration rainfall data are deemed to be
   reliable. The assessments of performance include comparisons between
   moments and design rainfall depths computed from observed data and from
   synthetic rainfall series generated by the models. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Huaihe River Basin is one of the most flood-prone basins in China
   because it is frequently affected by collapses of the south levee of the
   Huanghe (Yellow River) over a long period in addition to its
   transitional climate and poor drainage topography. The flood series in
   the Huaihe River Basin for the last 500-year period is reconstructed
   using the `Atlas' of historical recordings and annual hydrological data
   of the Basin, as well as the rational regional flood indices. The power
   spectrum structure of the flood series is similar to that of typical
   chaotic series and the attractor dimension (4.66) is larger than 2 and
   is a noninteger. Furthermore, chaotic dynamics of the flood series in
   the Huaihe River Basin with three dimensions and 2nd power is
   reconstructed according to chaos theory and the inverted theorem of
   differential equations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Soil and water conservation practices are increasingly being considered
   for curbing non-point source pollution from agricultural land. Several
   studies have demonstrated that stream power is a simple and good
   predictor of soil detachment and transport and can be used to predict
   the effect of soil and water conservation practices on soil loss. Our
   objective was, therefore, to develop a simple water erosion simulation
   model that is physically based on stream power, handles vegetation in
   terms of contact cover, and considers the settling velocity
   characteristics of the eroding sediment. The model assumes that rill
   flow can occur on hillslope segments with net erosion, but on segments
   with net deposition sheet flow is assumed. Input parameters include the
   depositability of the soil, rill shape, rill density, net precipitation,
   and an empirical power function describing the decrease of sediment
   concentration with vegetative cover increase. The model was evaluated by
   comparison of predicted and observed relationships between sediment
   concentration, slope, and vegetative residue cover in two experimental
   studies using simulated rainfall: one that involved erosion plots with
   various uniform slopes and levels of vegetative cover, and another that
   involved the observation of soil movement on mechanically shaped
   concave, uniform, and convex slopes with negligible vegetation. Without
   calibration, the model appeared to represent soil erosion relationships
   observed in these studies and is simple enough to be included in
   grid-based variable source hydrology models. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Asymptotic bias in large quantiles and moments for four parameter
   estimation methods, including the maximum likelihood method (MLM),
   method of moments (MOM), method of L-moments (LMM), and least squares
   method (LSM), is derived when a probability distribution function (PDF)
   is falsely assumed. The first three estimation methods are illustrated
   using the lognormal and gamma distributions forming an alternative set
   of PDFs. It is shown that for every method when either the gamma or
   lognormal distribution serves as the true distribution, the relative
   asymptotic bias (RB) of moments and quantiles corresponding to the upper
   tail is an increasing function of the true value of the coefficient of
   variation (c(v)), except that R-B of moments for MOM is zero. The value
   of RB is the smallest for MOM and largest for MLM. The bias of LMM
   occupies an intermediate position. The value of RB from MLM is larger
   for the lognormal distribution as a hypothetical distribution with the
   gamma distribution being assumed to be the true distribution than it
   would be in the opposite case. For c(v) = 1 and MLM, it equals 30, 600,
   320\% for mean, variance and 0.1\% quantile, respectively, while for
   MOM, the moments are asymptotically unbiased and the bias for 0.1\%
   quantile amounts to 35\%. An analysis of 39 70-year long annual peak
   flow series of Polish rivers provides an empirical evidence for the
   necessity to include bias in evaluation of the efficiency of PDF
   estimation methods. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of phase-space reconstruction approach for understanding and
   predicting suspended sediment concentration dynamics in rivers is
   investigated. According to this approach, the dynamic changes of the
   suspended sediment concentration phenomenon are represented by
   reconstructing (or embedding) the single-dimensional (or variable)
   suspended sediment concentration series in a multi-dimensional
   phase-space. After representing the dynamics in the phase-space, a local
   approximation method is employed for making predictions. The approach is
   employed for representing and predicting the dynamics of the daily
   suspended sediment concentration observed in the Mississippi River basin
   (at St. Louis, MO) in the United States of America. The predicted
   suspended sediment concentrations are found to be in very good agreement
   with the observed ones; not only are the major trends well captured but
   the minor (noisy) fluctuations reasonably preserved as well. The
   near-accurate predictions indicate the appropriateness of the
   phase-space reconstruction approach for understanding the suspended
   sediment concentration phenomenon. The results (i.e. optimal embedding
   dimension) also reveal that the suspended sediment concentration
   dynamics are dominantly influenced by three variables, suggesting that
   the suspended sediment concentration (and other sediment transport
   related) phenomena could be viewed from a low-dimensional chaotic
   dynamic perspective. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Chemical tracing of interbasin groundwater transfer in the lowland
   rainforest of Costa Rica}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Chemical data from several hundred surface water and groundwater samples
   collected mainly during baseflow over 4.5 years were used to detect and
   quantify the natural interbasin transfer of deep groundwater into
   watersheds at La Selva Biological Station, a research site in the
   lowland rainforest of Costa Rica. Most of the variability in major ion
   concentrations at La Selva can be explained by mixing of two chemically
   and hydrologically distinct waters: high-solute bedrock groundwater, and
   low from hillslope soils within the study watersheds. Several lines of
   evidence indicate that high-solute solute local water draining. bedrock
   groundwater represents subsurface interbasin transfer into the study
   site.
   The fraction of water due to interbasin transfer (f(water)) ranged from
   zero to about 0.49 for major streams at La Selva; f(water) values were
   even higher (up to 0.84) for small riparian seeps and shallow
   groundwater near the Salto stream. The relative contribution of major
   ions by interbasin transfer was even more significant than of water
   itself. f(water) values of 0.49 and 0.84 correspond to f(Cl) values of
   0.92 and 0.99, respectively (f(Cl) the fraction of dissolved chloride in
   a water sample that is due to interbasin transfer, is approximately
   equal to the fraction of all major ions contributed to the sample by
   interbasin transfer, given the observed linear correlation between Cl
   and other major ions). f(water) and f(Cl) of streams and riparian seeps
   varied on both long (monthly/seasonal) and short (storm event) time
   scales, in each case decreasing as conditions at La Selva became wetter.
   The high f(water) values found in riparian groundwater and seeps
   indicate that local water and bedrock groundwater derived from
   interbasin transfer mix in the shallow subsurface at La Selva, not just
   in stream channels. With f(water) values up to 0.84, it appears that
   some areas of riparian wetland may be maintained largely by interbasin
   transfer.
   This large interbasin transfer significantly affects both terrestrial
   (e.g. wetland) and aquatic ecosystems. Results suggest the importance of
   a regional approach to land use planning in this and similar
   environments. Complete protection of lowland streams, wetlands, and
   ecosystems in this hydrogeologic setting requires protection of a deep
   interbasin groundwater system whose precise volume, boundaries, and
   recharge areas are presently unknown. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Flows in horizontal homogeneous porous layers are studied in terms of a
   hydraulic model with an abrupt interface between two incompressible
   Darcian fluids of contrasting density driven by an imposed gradient
   along the layer. The flow of one fluid moving above a resting
   finger-type pool of another is studied. A straight interface between two
   moving fluids is shown to slump, rotate and propagate deeper under
   periodic drive conditions than in a constant-rate regime.
   Superpropagation of the interface is related to Philip's superelevation
   in tidal dynamics and acceleration of the front in vertical infiltration
   in terms of the Green-Ampt model with an oscillating ponding water
   level. All solutions studied are based on reduction of the governing PDE

Abstract = {{Troughs under threshold analysis has so far found little application in
   the modeling of minimum streamflows. In this study, all the troughs
   under a certain threshold level are considered in deriving the
   probability distribution of annual minima through the total probability
   theorem. For the occurrence of minima under the threshold, Poissonian,
   binomial or negative binomial processes are assumed. The magnitude of
   minima follows the generalized Pareto, exponential or power
   distribution. It is shown that asymptotic extreme value distributions
   for minima or the two-parameter Weibull distribution is obtained for the
   annual minima, depending on which models are assumed for the occurrence
   and magnitude of troughs under the threshold. Derived distributions can
   be used for modeling the minimum flows in streams which do not have zero
   flows. Expressions for the T-year annual minimum flow are obtained. An
   example illustrates the application of the troughs under threshold model
   to the minimum flows observed in a stream. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Numerical modelling of the transient moisture fluxes helps in the
   development of appropriate water management practices, but requires
   site-specific information on soil hydraulic properties. Forward
   simulations with a given set of Van Genuchten (VG) model parameters
   indicate that different soils act differently in their temporal variable
   evapotranspiration (ET) response under deep-water table/free drainage
   conditions. Since actual ET fluxes can be recovered from remote sensing
   measurements, a new possibility is established to derive soil hydraulic
   functions under actual field conditions for a range of spatial scales.
   Thus, inverse modelling of ET, fluxes is a promising way to estimate the
   so-called effective soil hydraulic functions. We numerically explore the
   possibility of inverse ET modelling to derive VG model parameters for
   semi-arid regions. The utility of this technique is evaluated using a
   simulation model to create a `no error data set' of ET fluxes for cotton
   crop. Objective functions using actual ET and actual transpiration (T)
   are defined. Backward simulations are carried out to re-assess selected
   VG model parameters for the three-soil types, i.e. sand, loamy sand and
   sandy clay loam. A realistic ET data set is created from the no error
   data set by incorporating different levels of random error. Seasonal
   simulated water balance components (ET, deep percolation and change in
   profile storage) are compared to study the hydrological performance of
   the inversely estimated soil hydraulic functions. Results indicate that
   the moisture stress period under fully developed crops is most
   appropriate for sampling ET fluxes to solve the proposed inverse
   problem. It is also observed that frequent observations of ET fluxes are
   desired to reduce undesirable correlation between different fitting
   parameters. It is observed that when ET fluxes are very accurate, the VG
   model parameters alpha, n and theta(s) (theta(r) k(s) and lambda fixed
   at actual values) are optimised precisely with 12 ET data points.
   Inverse fitting of these parameters (alpha, n and theta(s)) utilising
   perturbed data on ET fluxes results in effective soil hydraulic
   functions, which reliably predict different water balance components for
   sand and loamy sand soils. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Digital drainage direction maps are a prerequisite for analyzing the
   flow of water on the land surface of the Earth. For continental or
   global studies, the most appropriate and most frequently used resolution
   for such data sets appears to be 30' (longitude-by-latitude). In this
   paper we present the new global drainage direction map DDM30, a 30'
   raster map of surface drainage directions, which organizes the Earth's
   land area into drainage basins and provides the river network topology.
   DDM30 was generated by first upscaling two drainage direction maps
   (DDMs) at higher resolutions. The resulting map was then extensively
   corrected in an iterative manner by comparison against vectorized, high
   resolution river maps and other geographic information. Finally, it was
   co-referenced to the locations of 935 gauging stations (provided by the
   Global Runoff Data Centre GRDC), which again involved manual
   corrections. DDM30 was validated against drainage basin areas from the
   literature, against the given upstream areas of the GRDC stations and,
   most importantly, against information from HYDRO1k, a data set based on
   a hydrologically corrected 1-km digital elevation model which is thought
   to afford the best information on surface drainage currently available
   at the global scale. In the course of the validation, the quality of
   DDM30 was compared to three other 30' DDMs. The validation results show
   that DDM30 provides a more accurate representation of drainage
   directions and river network topology than the other 30' DDMs. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The forest industry plays a major role in the economy of eastern Canada.
   The recreational fishery also represents an important source of revenue
   for this area. Therefore, there is concern over the potential economic
   effects and ecological impacts from logging operations on aquatic
   habitats. The present study deals with the comparison of streamflow
   between pre and post timber harvesting at Catamaran Brook (New
   Brunswick, Canada) to identify any potential changes to the hydrological
   regime. Studies were carried out on two sub-basins of Catamaran Brook,
   namely the Middle Reach (mid-basin) and the Upper Tributary 1. The
   harvested area at the Middle Reach represented 2.3\% of this sub-basin
   while 23.4\% of Upper Tributary 1 was harvested. It was noted that
   during both the calibration and timber harvesting phases, meteorological
   conditions (e.g. precipitation, runoff) contributed to relatively high
   natural variability. When studying changes on an annual and seasonal
   basis for the basin cut at 2.3\% (i.e. Middle Reach) and using a control
   basin for comparison, no changes were detected to the annual water
   yield, seasonal runoff and streamflow timing between the calibration and
   timber harvesting phases. On a summer rainfall event basis, no changes
   were detected at the Middle Reach and the Upper Tributary 1 when
   studying relations between precipitation and stormflow (obtained through
   hydrograph separation). Alternatively, changes were detected in
   relations between peak flows and precipitation (p < 0.05) at the Upper
   Tributary 1 when comparing the calibration and timber harvesting phases.
   Peak flows showed higher values following timber harvesting. No
   significant changes were observed between peak flows and precipitation
   at the Middle Reach.
   When comparative studies were carried out on peak flow and stormflow
   between sub-basins (using the Middle Reach as control for treatments vs.
   the most affected site, i.e. Upper Tributary 1), significant changes
   were detected in peak flow (p < 0.05) between the calibration and timber
   harvesting phases at the Upper Tributary 1 only. Increased peak flows
   were observed at the Upper Tributary 1 compared to the Middle Reach
   following timber harvesting. It was concluded that for timber harvesting

Abstract = {{The aim of this research paper is to develop a statistical model that
   provides a more complete description of a basin's flood regime. The
   approach adopted in this paper is based on the flood-duration-frequency
   (QdF) analysis which takes into account the temporal variability of
   floods. This approach is analogous to the intensity-duration-frequency
   (IdF) model commonly used for rainfall analysis. The proposed model
   allows QdF curves for a given basin to be estimated while using a
   minimum number of parameters. This model is called `converging' model
   because of the observed convergence of distributions towards small
   return periods. A local (at-site) model and a regional approach are
   developed. The regional approach uses classical concepts of regional
   hydrologic frequency analysis (index-flood (IF) method) and can be used
   for basins where no streamflow data is available. Results from 158
   catchments located in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario (Canada) are
   used to illustrate the method. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Title = {{A review of the evolving perceptual model of hillslope flowpaths at the

Abstract = {{The Maimai catchment has been the site of ongoing hillslope research
   since the late 1970s. These studies have facilitated the development of
   a detailed perceptual model of hillslope hydrology at Maimai. This
   perceptual model has grown in complexity beyond analytical description;
   nonetheless it provides a very useful case study of hillslope
   hydrological processes and encapsulates much of what field hydrologists
   have come to recognize as the dominant hillslope runoff processes in
   steep, humid catchments. No single research approach has resolved the
   complexities of streamflow generation in this highly responsive
   catchment. Yet, each data set reviewed in this paper adds to the
   cumulative understanding of catchment behavior by providing alternative
   (and sometimes conflicting) interpretations of hillslope subsurface
   flow. Initial dye tracer studies of macropore flow provided insight into
   hillslope flow processes, but suffered from the limitations of a
   single-method approach. Subsequent water isotopic tracing studies showed
   clearly that stored soil water and groundwater comprised the majority of
   channel stormflow; notwithstanding, isotope-oriented approaches did not
   enable the development of a mechanistic understanding of hillslope
   processes. An integration of tensiometer recording and tracer techniques
   was required for later reconciliation of different process
   interpretations concerning the role of macropores, and old/new water
   ratios. Although single throughflow pits continued to be the indicator
   of subsurface flow timing and magnitude for several published studies at
   Maimai, subsequent whole hillslope trench studies showed that flow
   varied widely across a slope section-making the single pit observations
   of the previous studies suspect. Most recent observations demonstrate
   that small depressions in the bedrock surface may exert a significant
   control on water mobility and mixing. In particular, the bedrock
   topography appears to determine spatially the pathway of rapid saturated
   subsurface water flow and tracer breakthrough at the hillslope scale.
   The Maimai catchments in New Zealand provide a historical perspective on
   the issues faced by hillslope/small catchment hydrologists since the mid
   1970s and highlights the advantages of multiple repeat experiments for
   testing hypotheses and improving our mechanistic understanding of
   subsurface flow. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of water movement through the unsaturated zone of Upper
   Chalk in Southeast England were investigated during the winters of
   1995-1996 and 1996-1997. Regular measurements of soil water content and
   soil matric potential were made weekly, by neutron probe (to 3.6 m) and
   ordinary tensiometers (to 2.4 m) and half-hourly by theta probe and
   pressure transducer tensiometers (both to 1.2 m). Drainage was
   determined using the water balance method.
   Weekly measurements of water content showed changes of 5-8\% in the
   upper 2.0 m and about 2\% at depths >2.0 m during the season with only
   slight changes from week to week at 0.4 m and 0.2 m in response to rain
   showers. Matric potentials decreased with depth throughout the winter
   seasons with potentials in the soil ranging from -25 to -550 cm water
   and those below 1 m typically -100 to -950 cm water. The mean daily rate
   of drainage for the two seasons was 1.6 mm d(-1) and 1.5 mm d(-1) at 1.2
   m depth and 1.45 mm d(-1) and 1.1 mm d(-1) at 3.6 m. The mean maximum
   drainage rates calculated from weekly data were 4.6 mm d(-1) at 1.2 m
   and 3.1 mm d(-1) at 3.6 m. These weekly measurements suggested that flow
   was through the matrix because potentials were continuously low and the
   weekly rates of drainage were smaller than the hydraulic conductivity of
   the chalk matrix.
   However, half-hourly measurements showed rapid increases of water
   content and water potential at all depths to 1.0 m under a range of
   conditions after rain giving short-term maximum rates of drainage at 1.2
   m of up to 26 mm d(-1). Typically, water took about 7-9 h to travel from
   the surface to 1.2 m depth depending on the rainfall and antecedent
   conditions. These results indicate that fissures conducted water in the
   upper 1.2 m immediately after rainfall although the matric potential at
   1.0 m was > -50 cm water on only one occasion in the two seasons and
   frequently < -300 cm even after rain. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper attempts to assess the accuracy of constant eddy viscosity,
   Elder and k-epsilon turbulence models in the numerical simulation of
   reach-scale compound channel flows using two-dimensional (213) finite
   element methods. Assessment was conducted using benchmark
   stage-discharge data collected from straight and meandering compound
   channel configurations at the UK Engineering and Physical Science
   Research Council (EPSRC) Flood Channel Facility, For mesh resolutions
   and topologies used in reach-scale studies, all models were found to be
   adequate predictors (<5\% error in predicted flow depth) of the
   stage-discharge relationship at moderate overbank flows (Figs. I and 2).
   However, at inbank and low overbank flows the Elder and k-epsilon
   turbulence models can reproduce stage-discharge points with much greater
   accuracy than the constant eddy viscosity model. Hence, for an unsteady
   simulation where low flows are relevant a constant eddy viscosity
   turbulence closure may prove problematic. In terms of computed lateral
   distributions of depth-averaged velocity for both channel
   configurations, at higher depths (Relative depth = 0.666) all turbulence
   models predict the velocity with greater accuracy than at a lower depth
   (Relative depth = 0.333). At this latter depth, all turbulence models
   predict the depth-averaged longitudinal velocity distribution with poor
   accuracy (>20\% error). Also, sensitivity of the turbulence parameter
   calibration with respect to the predicted flow depth showed that the
   constant eddy viscosity model's performance can be highly dependent on
   the choice of turbulence parameter value. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Knowledge about the origin of solutes is required to define reasonable
   limits for surface water quality. The origin of the high chloride (0)
   concentrations in the drainage water of a recently reclaimed Dutch
   polder is analysed. Historical data on soil formation are used to
   understand the layering of the soil profile and its hydraulic
   properties. The salinisation process of the lake bottom in the period
   1600-1932 explains the Cl profiles in the soil. After reclamation in
   1942, the average application rate of Cl from fertiliser was 118 kg
   ha(-1) yr(-1). Natural Cl deposition was 37 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and average
   Cl crop uptake was 10 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Upward diffusion from the
   subsoil (>120cm depth) of about 220kg ha(-1) yr(-1) is the major term in
   the Cl mass balance. Annual Cl drain discharge is estimated at 365 kg
   ha(-1) yr(-1). Afield monitoring study in the winter leaching period
   1991-1992 showed that the Cl drain discharge was only 180 kg ha(-1)
   yr(-1), probably, due to the relatively small precipitation excess in
   that period.
   The dynamics of water flow and solute transport in a two-dimensional
   flow domain are well described by the HYDRUS-2D model based on the
   Richards and Laplace equations for movement of water and the
   convection-dispersion equation for solute transport. The large lateral
   flow component towards the drain in the topsoil (0-120 cm depth) in the
   zone just above and below the phreatic surface explains the peaks in Cl
   and nitrate concentrations in the drainage water. The combination of
   historical data, field experiments and a simulation model was fruitful
   in explaining the origin and dynamics of Cl concentrations in the
   drainage water. The high Cl concentrations in the drainage and surface
   water are natural background concentrations originating mainly from the
   subsoil of the reclaimed polder. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this study, detailed monitoring of water and sediment delivery from
   major tunnel systems was conducted in a small semi-arid sub-basin,
   locally known as Yangdaogou, in the hilly loess region, North China.
   These deep-seated tunnels are located as much as 30 m below the slope
   surface, in deep Quaternary loess formations. In the Yangdaogou. these
   systems have large amphitheatre-like inlets, with mean diameter and
   depth of 4.8 and 4.99 m, respectively. These dimensions represent some
   of the largest tunnel inlets in the world. During 1989 and 1990, fifteen
   rainstorms were monitored at six tunnel outlets. Due to practical
   difficulties, only 35 sets of tunnel-storm data were obtained. Observed
   sediment concentration of tunnel flows ranges from 8.2 to 893.2 g/l. The
   peak sediment concentrations in tunnel flows are not distinctively
   higher than those in channel flows but considerably higher than those
   measured from untunneled sideslopes. No significant correlations between
   runoff and sediment yield can be found in most tunnels at both
   within-and between-storm levels. Such an erratic relationship is
   ascribed to the rapid shift of runoff and sediment source area, the
   occurrence of collapses within tunnels, and the initiation of new tunnel
   inlets. Based on the field monitored data, 57\% of basin sediment
   production is delivered by the tunnel systems, suggesting that tunnel
   erosion is a major erosion process in the hilly loess region. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Major ion, silica and pH data from a high Arctic proglacial stream
   network are examined. Factor analysis shows that the major controls upon
   hydrochemistry in the basin include snowpack solute elution, rapid
   alteration of minerals via surface reactions and slow, incongruent
   silicate dissolution. The importance of chemical weathering is found to
   increase downstream at the expense of solute acquisition from the
   transient snowpack. Data from a series of snow pits show that snowpack
   solute elution is characterised by the preferential elution of SO42-.
   Evidence for the preferential elution of NO3- is equivocal. However,
   NO3- levels in proglacial runoff may be enhanced by the leaching of
   cryotic soils later in the ablation season.
   Chemical weathering is dominated by calcite dissolution at high
   elevations and a combination of calcite and dolomite dissolution in the
   downstream proglacial environment. Silicate weathering at high
   elevations is characterised by the enrichment of K+ relative to Si.
   Concentrated active layer soil waters show less enrichment of K and
   constitute a potentially important source of dissolved silica to the
   river system. Na+ is also produced by silicate weathering, but its
   mobility is believed to be largely governed by ion exchange with Ca2+
   early in the ablation season.
   All chemical weathering environments are characterised by high p(CO2)
   due to either respiration within the soil or, at higher elevations
   within the catchment, H+ provision from acid aerosol and sulphide
   oxidation. However, rates of sulphide oxidation are limited because the
   cold-based thermal regime of the glaciers effectively prevents access of
   meltwaters to freshly comminuted sub-glacial sulphide minerals. The
   restricted sub-glacial weathering therefore means that ice marginal and
   proglacial environments are the most important zones of solute
   acquisition by meltwaters, causing significant enrichment of major ions,
   silica and dissolved CO2 within only a short distance of the
   contemporary ice margin. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The temporal and spatial patterns of summer extreme low flows and
   effects on stream ecosystems were evaluated throughout the Otago Region
   of the South Island of New Zealand during a severe drought in 1998-1999.
   Flows, water quality, and aquatic biology were monitored bimonthly at 12
   locations as part of a long-term regional monitoring programme and
   results were evaluated and compared among summer 1998-1999 and all
   previous summers, as well as among three major subregions. Flows during
   the drought were extremely low for prolonged periods in many locations,
   particularly in North Otago. At most sites temperatures were slightly
   higher for a longer period than during other summers. In predominantly
   agricultural/pastoral catchments, widespread bacterial contamination of
   streams occurred due to increased livestock use of watercourses and
   decreased dilution during low flows. Concentrations of other
   contaminants derived from non-point sources, including nitrogen,
   phosphorus, and sediment, decreased in many locations due to the lack of
   rainfall and runoff events. Electrical conductivity generally increased
   as a result of the lack of dilution and increased evaporation and
   groundwater inputs. Overall water quality was worst in agricultural
   catchments in South Otago, and returned to conditions prior to the low
   flows by late autumn in most areas.
   The diversity of benthic macroinvertebrate communities and number of
   sensitive taxa decreased somewhat in many locations, but the magnitude
   and duration of these effects were not great. Differences between summer
   1998-1999 and other periods, and among subregions, were not significant.
   Although some differences in low flows and effects on stream ecosystems
   across a range of landscapes and catchments can occur, the rapid
   recovery of water quality and benthic macroinvertebrates in most
   locations indicates that many streams are resilient to extreme low flows
   and drought with minor long-term effects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Low cost microcatchment treatments for rainwater harvesting are needed
   under the local poor economic conditions in the semiarid loess regions
   of northwest China. This paper was intended to study the effectiveness
   of runoff yield from compacted catchments with some local earth
   materials under the natural rainfall. The compacted catchments were
   constructed with uniformly mixed loess, laterite and fine sand at the
   ratio of 1:1:1. The results showed that rainfall-runoff efficiency from
   such compacted plots was 33\% of the total rainfall as compared to 8.7\%
   from the untreated plots. The compacted catchments had low infiltration
   rate, and the minimum precipitation required to produce runoff
   (threshold rainfall) was 4 mm, under no antecedent rainfall effects and
   1.9 mm under antecedent rainfall effects. In contrast, the threshold
   rainfall was about 8.5 mm for the untreated catchments under no
   antecedent rainfall effects and 6 mm under antecedent rainfall effects.
   The compacted catchment with local soils has a great potential for
   rainfall harvesting in the semiarid regions of China, but soil erosion
   is a problem, some form of soil stabilization would be needed in future
   use. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Overland flow is often only a few millimetres deep. Consequently, the
   potential for raindrop impact to affect flow hydraulics and sediment
   transport is high. Furthermore, the relative importance of rainfall
   impact is highest for shallow low-energy flows on low slopes. In such
   flows net sediment deposition may occur. Therefore, laboratory
   experiments were conducted to study sediment deposition in the presence
   of rainfall over a range of hydraulic conditions. In order to
   investigate the impact of raindrops on sediment deposition by overland
   flow, these experimental data were compared to the experimental data
   collected in the absence of raindrop impact. Comparison of the
   experimental data shows that raindrop impact retards the flow velocity
   and has a clear positive effect on sediment delivery. Under rainfall
   significantly more coarse sediment is transported over areas of net
   sediment deposition. Subsequently, the experimental results are used to
   evaluate a multi-class net deposition theory, describing sediment
   transport and sediment sorting over areas of net deposition in the
   presence of both raindrop impact and flow-driven processes. The
   multi-class theory is calibrated using part of the experimental data.
   Evaluation of the model predictions using the other part of the data
   shows that the optimised model is able to accurately predict sediment
   delivery and sediment sorting over areas of net deposition. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Field investigations were performed in semiarid Tunisia to investigate
   spatial variability of preferential pathways in catchment- and
   plot-scales. A rainfall simulator with dye was used to simulate effects
   of a 20-year rainstorm. After infiltration into six one-meter square
   plots, vertical 2.5-cm thick soil sections were excavated, and dye
   penetrations were photographed, The results show that different
   catchment physiographic areas (nose, slope, and hollow) displayed
   significantly different responses to the infiltrating dye. Nose and
   hollow areas exhibited larger susceptibility to preferential flow. Here.
   infiltrated dye was transported to greater depths. Slopes had fewer deep
   cracks and fissures. The dye distribution within each plot was also
   investigated. The variability of the dye patterns increased with scale.
   Cross-correlations and power spectrum analyses indicated that the
   preferential pathways were randomly distributed. The power-law behavior
   of the dye patterns' spectral density suggested scale invariance and the
   possibility of random cascade modeling. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{In performance assessment studies of radioactive waste disposal in
   crystalline rocks. one source of uncertainty is the appropriateness of
   conceptual models of the physical processes contributing to the
   potential transport of radionuclides, The Alternative Models Project
   (AMP) evaluates the uncertainty of models of groundwater flow, an
   uncertainty that arises from alternative conceptualisations of
   groundwater movement in fractured media. The AMP considers three
   modelling approaches for simulating flow and advective transport from
   the waste canisters to the biosphere: Stochastic Continuum, Discrete
   Fracture Network, and Channel Network. Each approach addresses spatial
   variability via Monte Carlo simulation. whose realisations are
   summarised by the statistics of three simplified measures of geosphere
   performance: travel time, transport resistance (a function of travel
   distance, flow-wetted surface per volume of rock, and Darcy velocity
   along a flowpath), and canister flux (Darcy velocity at repository
   depth). The AMP uses a common reference case defined by a specific model
   domain, boundary conditions, and layout of a hypothetical repository,
   with a consistent set of summary statistics to facilitate the comparison
   of the three approaches. The three modelling approaches predict similar
   median travel times and median canister fluxes, but dissimilar
   variability. The three modelling approaches also predict similar values
   for minimum travel time and maximum canister flux, and predict similar
   locations for particles exiting the geosphere. The results suggest that
   the problem specifications (i.e. boundary conditions and gross
   hydrogeology) constrain the flow modelling, limiting the impact or this
   conceptual uncertainty on performance assessment. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The multi-criteria calibration procedure MOCOM-UA was used to evaluate
   the validity of a physically based precipitation-runoff model by forcing
   the model to simulate several observed system responses simultaneously.
   The model is based on kinematic wave approximations to saturated
   subsurface flow and saturation overland flow at the hillslope scale in a
   landcape with a shallow layer of permeable deposits overlying a
   relatively impermeable bedrock. The following results were found; (i)
   the MOCOM-UA method was capable of exploiting information about the
   physical system contained in the measurement data time series; (ii) the
   multi-criteria calibration procedure provided estimates of the
   uncertainty associated with model predictions and parameters; (iii)
   multi-criteria calibration constraining the behavior of the
   precipitation-runoff model to observed runoff and groundwater levels
   reduced the uncertainty of model predictions; (iv) the multi-criteria
   method reduced the uncertainty of the estimates of model parameters; (v)
   the precipitation-runoff model was able to reproduce several observed
   system responses simultaneously during both calibration and validation
   periods; and (vi) the groundwater table depths exerted a major control
   on the hydrological response of the investigated catchment. (C) 2002

   hydrologic and other applications. The hydrologic models were calibrated
   to the observed data (e.g. soil moisture and streamflow) at the basin
   and subbasin-scales, The HMS-simulated hydrologic response to observed
   precipitation from a six-storm sequence compares well to the observed.
   The subgrid-scale spatial variability in precipitation and hydraulic
   conductivity is included in HMS simulations with RCM-modeled
   precipitation. Nested 108-36-12 km RCM domains are used for the
   multi-storm simulation. The 12 km RCM-modeled precipitation is then
   downscaled to a 1 km hydrologic grid resolution for HMS simulation.
   Simulations of the six-storm sequence by the RCM produce precipitation
   fields that appear realistic in general, but that diverge in detail from
   observed precipitation in both time and space. HMS proves to be
   sensitive to these details, so the simulated streamflow does not
   accurately reproduce observed streamflow. The results suggest potential
   value in improving on the current versions of RCM and HMS for regional
   climate and hydrology system modeling. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Concentrations and fluxes of particulate, dissolved and gaseous forms of
   hydrologic carbon were measured in two contrasting acidic upland streams
   in NE Scotland and Mid-Wales. Sampling was undertaken at the outlet of
   each catchment, on a weekly or biweekly basis over 2 years. In addition,
   spatial variations in concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC).
   dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), free CO2 and CH4 are presented for
   both streams along 14 contiguous sites between the source and the outlet
   of each catchment. Concentrations of carbon determinants along each
   stream reflected increasing inputs of TOC and gaseous forms of carbon
   from soil-pore water emanating from deep peat areas; these
   concentrations subsequently decreased downstream due to changing soil
   characteristics and in-stream processes.
   The total annual carbon flux was 191 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) from the NE
   Scotland site compared to 121 kg C ha(1) yr(1) from the Mid-Wales
   stream, mainly due to significantly higher dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) concentrations (p < 0.001) found in the Scottish stream. DOC
   dominated the carbon flux at both the NE Scotland (88.4\%) and Mid-Wales
   (69.0\%) sites, reflecting the importance of organic carbon sources in
   both catchments. Particulate organic carbon ( 18.5 and 27.4 kg C ha(1)
   yr(-1) for NE Scotland and Mid-Wales, respectively), HCO3--C (1.12 and
   1.28 kg C ha(1) yr(1)) and free CO2-C (2.62 and 8.75 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1))
   also contributed to the overall carbon flux. The CH4-C flux at the
   outlet of each catchment was less than 0.01 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Climatic
   differences between the two sites were expressed in terms of
   significantly higher discharge and temperature, which caused an increase
   in CO2 and CH4 export from the warmer and wetter Mid-Wales catchment.

Abstract = {{A 5-year daily measurement of the dynamic level in a borehole was
   plotted versus cumulative yield since the beginning of exploitation.
   Eighty percent of the experimental curve is explained by a linear
   function (h = aQ(c) + h(0)) by intervals. Only floods, which follow
   heavy storms and non-pumping cannot be taken into account. The slopes of
   the straight lines are spread around two constant values of the slope:
   a(r) = +0.35 x 10(-3) m m(-3), which characterizes the part which is
   controlled by recharge, and a(p) = -0.14 x 10(-3) m m(-3), which
   characterizes the draining part of the aquifer fractures. This linear
   fitting demonstrates that the borehole -aquifer system can be considered
   as an equivalent continuous medium, where the linear relationship
   between dynamic head and pumped yield are defined by the values of ar
   and a, Thus the hydraulic behavior of the aquifer differs according to
   the pumping rate: equivalent continuous medium for a low rate, dual
   permeability for a high one. This work demonstrates that the long-term
   behavior of an exploited fissured aquifer can be described by a simple
   model, if the duration of the aquifer test is long enough (1-3 months).
   It also shows that the production phase must include repetitive head
   measurements in order to refine the exploitation yield and the
   management conditions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The rain kinetic energy (KE) is a widely used indicator of the potential
   ability of rain to detach soil. However, rain kinetic energy is not a
   commonly measured meteorological parameter. Therefore, empirical laws
   linking the rain kinetic energy to the more easily available rain
   intensity (I) have been proposed based on drop-size and drop-velocity
   measurements. The various mathematical expressions used to relate rain
   kinetic energy and rain intensity available from the literature are
   reported in this study. We focus our discussion on the two expressions
   of the kinetic energy used: the rain kinetic energy expended per volume
   of rain or volume-specific kinetic energy (KEmm, J m(-2) mm(-1)) and the
   rain kinetic energy rate or time-specific kinetic energy (KEtime, J
   m(-2) h(-1)). We use statistical and micro-physical considerations to
   demonstrate that KEtime is the most appropriate expression to establish
   an empirical law between rain kinetic energy and rain intensity.
   Finally, considering the existing dropsize distribution models from
   literature, we show that the most suitable mathematical function to link
   KE and I is a power law. The constants of the power law are related to
   rain type, geographical location and measurement technique. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The issues of noise reduction and the reliability of its application to
   hydrologic time series are discussed. First, the concepts of noise, its
   effect, and noise reduction are briefly presented. Second, a few
   published articles in hydrology are critically reviewed with regard to
   the application of noise reduction to hydrologic data. Third,: a case
   study of the English River, Ontario, Canada, is used to support the
   conclusions. It is found that the commonly used algorithm for noise
   reduction in hydrologic data might also remove a significant part of the
   original signal and introduce an artificial chaoticity to the data. It
   is recommended that current noise reduction algorithms should be applied
   with caution and used only for better estimation of chaotic invariants.
   The raw data should always be the basis for any further hydrologic
   analysis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fog deposition was quantified by comparing the water budget of a small
   head-water catchment with direct measurements of evapotranspiration by
   the eddy-covariance-energy-budget-(ECEB)-method and with results of a
   resistance model. Results from the model showed a distinct altitudinal
   gradient in fog deposition mirroring different fog frequencies. For two
   water budget years the model amounted to 270 mm of occult precipitation,
   while the water budget comparison reached 215 mm. To characterize its
   contribution to element deposition fog was collected by active and
   passive samplers. Element fluxes were calculated by multiplying
   concentrations with modeled water fluxes stratified by wind directions
   in order to account for the influence of the Bohemian Industrial Basin.
   Element deposition through fog was in the case of SO42 -S, NH42 -N and
   K+ higher than wet deposition. Fog deposition is so an important path
   within bulk deposition for forested hill sites. The measured ion
   concentrations in fog water have declined considerably (60-90\%) over
   the last 10 years at the same site. This trend confirms with other
   measurements of air pollution and atmospheric deposition in the Eastern
   Erzgebirge. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Karstic watersheds appear as highly as non-linear and non-stationary
   systems. The behaviour of karstic springs has been previously studied
   using non-linear simulation methods (Volterra expansion) and
   non-stationary analyses methods based on wavelet transforms. The main
   issue of karstic spring behaviour consists of the presence and the
   identification of characteristic time-scales.
   In order to highlight more precisely the scale-properties of the
   rainfall-runoff relations for karstic springs, the multifractal analysis
   is introduced. These methods are applied daily and half-hourly rainfall
   rates and runoffs measured on a three French karstic springs located in
   the Pyrenees Mountains (Ariege, France): Aliou, Baget and Fontestorbes.
   They are characterised by a variable development of the drainage
   systems. We have at our disposal long and uninterrupted series of data
   over period of several years, which constitute a high quality bank data.
   Multifractal analyses of both daily and half-hourly rainfall rates and
   runoffs give evident a scale-dependant behaviour. Effectively, it
   highlights the presence of different multifractal processes at each
   sampling rate.
   Using a universal class of multifractal models based on cascade
   multiplicative processes, the identified multifractal sub-processes are
   characterised by the classical parameters alpha and C-1. All these
   results should lead to several improvements in karstic springflow
   simulation models. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The currently adopted rainfall-based design flood estimation techniques,
   for example the Design Event Approach, do not account for the
   probabilistic nature of the key variables except for the rainfall depth.
   This arbitrary treatment of key inputs and parameters can lead to
   inconsistencies and significant bias in flood estimates for a given
   average recurrence interval, This paper presents a Monte Carlo
   simulation technique that makes explicit allowance for the
   probability-distributed nature of the key flood producing variables and
   the dependencies between them to determine derived flood frequency
   curves. The proposed approach employs joint probability principles to
   develop a design flood estimation technique that can incorporate
   commonly applied rainfall-runoff models and design data. The application
   of the proposed technique to three catchments in Victoria has shown that
   the new method provides a relatively precise reproduction of the
   observed frequency curves, The new technique is relatively easy to apply
   for catchments with good rainfall data and a limited streamflow record.
   The technique thus shows a strong potential to become a practical design
   tool; further work is needed to allow its routine application in a wider
   range of design situations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A literature survey shows how biogeochemical (coupled organic and
   inorganic reaction processes) transport models are based on considering
   the complete biodegradation process as either a single- or as a two-step
   process. It is demonstrated that some two-step process models rely on
   the Partial Equilibrium Approach (PEA). The PEA assumes the organic
   degradation step, and not the electron acceptor consumption step, is
   rate limiting. This distinction is not possible in one-step process
   models, where consumption of both the electron donor and acceptor are
   treated kinetically. A three-dimensional, two-step PEA model is
   developed. The model allows for Monod kinetics and biomass growth,
   features usually included only in one-step process models. The
   biogeochemical part of the model is tested for a batch system with
   degradation of organic matter under the consumption of a sequence of
   electron acceptors. A second paper {[}J. Hydrol. 256 (2002) 230-249],
   reports the application of the model to a field study of biogeochemical
   transport processes in a landfill plume in Denmark (Vejen). (C) 2002

   with the observed distribution in the plume of a number of species. such
   as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), Fe2+, NO3-, HCO3-, SO42-, CH4, and
   pH. The simulated redox zones agree with observations confirming that
   the Fe-reducing zone played an important role in the attenuation of the
   DOC plume. Effective first-order rate constants for every redox zone
   were determined giving DOC half-lives ranging from 100 to 1-2 days going
   from the methanogenic to the aerobic zone. The order of decrease in DOC
   half-lives from the anaerobic to the aerobic zone corresponds to
   findings at other landfills. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Multi-decadal modelling of the soil water balance is often limited by
   the availability of data needed to calculate potential evaporation (PE).
   A solution sometimes adopted is to use available precipitation data but
   substitute a climatological representation of PE, the rationale being
   that PE is an inherently conservative variable. Convincing support for
   such an approach can be found in the literature but there are grounds
   for suspecting significant bias under extreme conditions. The validity
   of using climatological PE in long-term water balance studies is
   investigated by comparing soil water deficit time series simulated using
   a daily water balance model. This involves comparing a baseline run of
   the model using actual PE (based on observations) with alternative
   simulations using various climatology-based estimates of PE. The
   modelling experiments are over 13 years for one site (Auckland, New
   Zealand) with emphasis on comparing model performance during wet and dry
   years. Results show that substituting climatological PE estimates into
   the daily water balance produces a soil water regime very similar to
   that derived using actual PE values, including over relatively extreme
   periods. Best results were obtained where a PE reduction was applied to
   account for PE suppression on raindays, but the improvement in
   performance was minor compared to cruder methods, including PE estimates
   based on monthly data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The water balance of large watersheds in Texas was studied using a
   process level watershed model called the soil and water assessment tool
   (SWAT). The major components of the SWAT watershed model are
   evapo-transpiration (ET), soil water storage (SW), and water yield
   (WYLD), which is the sum of surface runoff and subsurface flow,
   Important input variables controlling the water balance in watersheds
   are the soils and climate. In this paper, changes in mean and variance
   of water balance components due to variability in soils and climate were
   assessed for six different watersheds (Hydrologic Cataloging Units,
   HCUs) in Texas covering wet to semi-arid regions using 1:250,000 scale
   data. Bulk density, soil available water capacity, and moist soil albedo
   were selected as soil parameters. Soil heterogeneity in watersheds was
   defined in terms of textural classes in the soil textural triangle.
   Spatial variability of precipitation between neighboring weather
   stations was quantified using power spectra. The impact of geographic
   scales on changes to the mean of the water balance components was
   determined by studying the Seco Creek sub-watershed within the Hondo HCU
   using 1:24,000 scale data. Results from scales of observation show that
   changes to mean SW was high as a function of increasing scale from
   1:250,000 to 1:24,000, while mean ET sensitivity remained about the
   same. The direct influence of soil properties such as bulk density,
   available water capacity, on the variance of ET, SW, and WYLD was about
   equal when using 1:24,000 scale data. For watersheds in wet climate
   composed of heterogeneous soils (loam fine sands and fine sandy loams),
   the means of the water components were relatively sensitive to climate
   and soils variability, and soil heterogeneity. Watersheds composed of
   shallow soils in semi-arid climate showed sensitivity of mean water
   balance components due to moist albedo and available water capacity.
   Changes to mean and variance of water balance components as a function
   of geographic scale suggest the presence of scale-dependent water
   balance `uncertainty' laws. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Contaminant transport in streams and rivers is often affected by the
   solute exchange between the main stream and various adjacent storage
   zones as well as chemical and biological processes. This paper focuses
   on the difference between the effects of conservative and reactive
   solute exchange, respectively, in terms of an analytical transport model
   that takes into account main stream advection, solute exchange with
   storage zones, instantaneous equilibrium sorption and first order
   reactions. The effects of longitudinal variation of water flow and
   hydraulic radius as well as transversal variation of streambed porosity
   were included in the analysis, which was conducted on a reach by reach
   basis. To be able to use a temporally variable upstream concentration as
   boundary concentration, the measured breakthroughs were divided into
   30-150 segments of constant concentration and the solutions were
   obtained as the sum of solutions for all segments. An experiment in
   Uppland County in Sweden, constitutes the basis for this study. Results
   from a simultaneous injection of the tracers tritium, (H2O)-H-3, and
   chromium Cr-51(III), made it possible to distinguish between
   conservative and reactive transport along a 30 km. reach of the Sava
   Stream. The peak concentration of the reactive chromium decreased faster
   with distance, than that of tritium. The main hypothesis is that the
   chromium exchange is affected by both rapid sorption processes and
   slower reactions in the subsurface storage zones. In this framework, the
   slow processes appear as irreversible, which is true at least on the
   time scale represented by the data. The irreversibility is probably
   caused by the net effect of various slow chemical processes, e.g. solute
   precipitation/co-precipitation and irreversible sorption, which
   decreases the washout rate after the main bulk of the solute has passed
   by in the stream. A fully reversible exchange description, with
   instantaneous equilibrium partitioning, gives a clearly overestimated
   tail for chromium, which is not the case with the present concept.
   Results obtained by independently evaluating seven subreaches of the
   stream give mean Reaction Damkohler numbers for the storage zone
   equalling 2.63 for the transport of Cr-51 and 0 for (H2O)-H-3. (C) 2002

   the water column, aggregation of colloidal iron to particulate iron, and
   reduction of colloidal and particulate iron in the deep anoxic waters.
   The model includes sedimentation of both colloidal and particulate
   species. The cycling of lead is described by adsorption on colloidal
   iron, transfer to the particulate phase by aggregation, and
   redissolution in the deep waters during reduction of colloidal and
   particulate iron.
   Generally, this model reproduces experimental data collected during
   three field trips from 1994 to 1996 well. However, these calculations
   clearly show that the processes regulating the cycling of iron and lead
   in the water column are more complex than what is generally admitted.
   Additional reactions not considered in the model affect the
   transformation of Fe, and thus affect the removal of Pb. These reactions
   have to be fully characterized in order to predict the chemical
   distribution of trace elements at oxic-anoxic transitions in the water
   column of aquatic systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A quantitative approach was used to monitor movement of nitrate through
   a karst spring basin. The research follows nitrate along flow paths,
   from application as fertilizer, through the soil matrix, into the
   bedrock, and ultimately, as discharge from a spring. On the basis of
   data from analysis of soil cores and spring water samples, it was
   calculated that for the period of one year, 22,000 kg of nitrate as
   nitrogen was discharged from a spring with a drainage basin area of
   43.85 km(2).
   After application of animal waste as fertilizer, the nitrate leaches
   through the soil primarily as piston flow in the matrix, unless
   macropores are encountered. Cores collected from fertilized fields show
   that the nitrate moves at a rate of approximately 65 cm/year through the
   silt and clay loams. The cores also revealed the presence of nitrate
   maximums with depth that were associated with timing of fertilizer
   application. Soil sampling and spring monitoring suggest that the soil
   serves as a reservoir for nitrate. Nitrate as nitrogen concentrations in
   the soil range from 0.012 to 0.036 g/kg of soil, which would be
   equivalent to 11 - 106 mg of NO3-N/I water. After reaching the bedrock
   surface, nitrate enters the aquifer in fractures and solution-enlarged
   joints, eventually discharging from the spring. Spring discharge data
   indicate that 74\% of the nitrate exits from the basin through the
   spring during baseflow conditions, and the remaining 26\% is discharged
   as a result of rapid recharge associated with precipitation storm
   pulses. During precipitation events, overland flow and runoff moves
   primarily through macropores in the soil carrying mainly surface derived
   nitrate, and displaces little of the soil nitrate. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Schneealpe karst massif of Triassic limestones and dolomites with
   the altitude up to 1800 m a.s.l., situated 100 km SW of Vienna in
   Kalkalpen, is the main drinking water resource for the city. The
   catchment area of about 23 km(2) is drained by two springs: the
   Wasseralmquelle (196 Vs) and the Siebenquellen (310 1/s). This karstic
   aquifer is approximated by two interconnected parallel flow systems of:
   (a) a fissured-porous aquifer, and (b) karstic channels. The
   fissured-porous aquifer is of a high storage capacity and contains
   mobile water in the fissures and stagnant water in the porous matrix.
   The water enters this system at the surface and flows through it to
   drainage channels, which are regarded as a separate flow system, finally
   drained by both springs. The channels are also connected with sinkholes,
   which introduce additional water directly from the surface, Measurements
   of O-18 and tritium in precipitation and springs were modelled by a
   combined application of lumped-parameter models. Modelling yielded
   information on the mean values of the following hydraulic parameters:
   (1) The volume of water in the whole catchment area is 255 X 10(6) m(3),
   of which about 1.8 X 10(6) m(3) are in channels and 253 X 10(6) m(3) in
   the fissured-porous aquifer. (2) The total volumetric flow rate is 506
   1/s, of which 77 1/s comprises direct flow from sinkholes to springs and
   429 1/s are contributed to fissured-porous aquifer. (3) As the volume of
   the massif is 16.6 x 10 m(3), the total water saturated porosity
   (fissures and micropores of the matrix) is 1.5\% and the channel
   porosity is about 0.01\%. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Wetting-front movement, flow-field evolution, and drainage of fracture
   flow paths were evaluated within the Topopah Spring welded tuff at Yucca
   Mountain, Nevada. Equipment and techniques were developed for in situ
   quantification of formation intake rates, flow velocities, seepage
   rates, and volumes of fracture flow paths. Localized injections of
   liquid into a low-permeability zone (LPZ) and a high-permeability zone
   (HPZ) along a borehole were detected in two boreholes below the point of
   injection. For the LPZ tests, water did not seep into an excavated slot
   that defined the lower boundary of the test bed, and the liquid-intake
   rate under constant-head conditions was observed to steadily decrease by
   two orders of magnitude. In the HPZ, liquid-intake rates under
   constant-head conditions were significantly higher and did not exhibit a
   strong systematic decline. HPZ tests were also conducted under a range
   of constant-flow conditions. Slot seepage rates showed intermittent
   responses and the percentage of injected water recovered in the slot
   increased as each test progressed. A maximum of 80\% of the injected
   water was recovered during high-rate injection tests. The flow path
   volumes were found to increase during the course of each HPZ test. The
   data collected during these field tests has provided useful information
   for developing an understanding of liquid flow in unsaturated fractured
   welded tuff. It has also provided a basis for quantitative comparisons
   with numerical simulations of liquid-release experiments, as
   demonstrated in a companion paper {[}J. Hydrol. 256 (2002)]. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{We have carried out a numerical modeling study in conjunction with the
   in situ liquid-release experiment described in Salve et al. {[}J.
   Hydrol. 257 (2001)]. The experiment site is a highly fractured welded
   tuff accessed from the Exploratory Studies Facility, an underground
   laboratory in the unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The
   experiment examines the effect of the rock matrix on liquid flow and
   transport that occurs primarily through the fracture network. The
   purpose of the modeling is to aid in experimental design, predict
   experimental results, and study the physical processes accompanying
   liquid flow through unsaturated fractured welded tuff. The model uses
   cubic elements arranged in a regular three-dimensional grid to represent
   a 24 m(3) block of fractured tuff. High-permeability fracture elements
   located deterministically preserve the connectivity of the fracture
   network, which is crucial to its ability to conduct fluid. Because
   element thickness is much greater than fracture aperture, fracture
   elements are assigned properties of a fracture continuum rather than of
   an individual fracture. The fracture network is constructed using
   fracture geometry data taken from a fracture map of the walls and
   ceiling of the alcove adjacent to the field test site. The network is
   then refined using the results of air-permeability tests. Model results
   suggest that it may not be sufficient to conceptualize the fractured
   tuff as consisting of high-permeability fractures embedded in a
   low-permeability matrix. The need to include a secondary fracture
   network (with distinct characteristics from the network of larger mapped
   fractures) is demonstrated by comparison to the liquid flow observed in
   the field. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Trend analysis is widely used for detecting changes in hydrological
   data. Parametric methods for this employ pre-specified models and
   associated tests to assess significance, whereas non-parametric methods
   generally apply rank tests to the data. Neither approach is suitable for
   exploratory analysis, because parametric models impose a particular,
   perhaps unsuitable, form of trend, while testing may confirm that trend
   is present but does not describe its form. This paper describes
   semi-parametric approaches to trend analysis using local likelihood
   fitting of annual maximum and partial duration series and illustrates
   their application to the exploratory analysis of changes in extremes in
   sea level and river flow data. Bootstrap methods are used to quantify
   the variability of estimates. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All lights

Abstract = {{The goal of the paper is to present a model for generating daily
   precipitation time series and its applications to two climatologically
   different areas. The rainfall is modeled as stochastic process coupled
   to atmospheric circulation. Rainfall is linked to the circulation
   patterns using conditional model parameters. Any kind of circulation
   pattern classification can be used for this purpose. In this study a new
   fuzzy rule based method of circulation patterns classification was used,
   The advantage of this classification technique is the fact that in
   contrast to common circulation patterns classifications its objective is
   to explain the variability of local precipitation. It means that the
   circulation patterns explain the relation between large-scale
   atmospheric circulation and surface climate (precipitation). Therefore
   the circulation patterns obtained by this classification method are
   suitable as input for the subsequent precipitation downscaling. The
   model was successfully applied in two regions with different climate
   conditions: Central Europe (Germany) and Eastern Mediterranean (Greece).
   Several tests like comparison of mean seasonal cycles, comparison of
   mean values and deviations of yearly totals and other standard
   diagnostics showed that simulated values agree fairly well with
   historical data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Some analyses are carried out with regard to canopy interception
   processes during rainfall events based on a tank model. A hypothesis,
   rainfall interception rate is proportional to the product of potential
   evaporation and rainfall intensity, is formed from past experimental
   data, and is applied to the data in this study. Computational equations
   are proposed to the interception rate and accumulative interception loss
   under constant rainfall intensity. Data from the Shirakawatani
   experimental forested catchment are used in order to examine the
   relationship between the interception rate and rainfall intensity, the
   ratio of the interception rate to rainfall intensity and potential
   evaporation, accumulative interception loss and the rainfall duration,
   and accumulative interception loss and accumulative rainfall. These
   regression relations show that interception processes are described by
   rainfall intensity and potential evaporation. An equation relating the
   aerodynamic resistance in the Penman-Monteith equation to rainfall
   intensity is proposed to explain the fact that the interception rate
   exceeds net radiation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Data from passive microwave remote sensing with an ESTAR L-band
   radiometer, deployed on an aircraft, were used to produce soil moisture
   images over the area of the Little Washita watershed in Oklahoma in
   1992. This area was revisited during the Southern Great Plains 1997
   Hydrology Experiment. This offered an opportunity to evaluate the
   time-specificity of the conclusions, relating to scaling of the surface
   soil moisture, that have been reported for 1992. The objective of this
   work was to compare scaling properties of soil moisture fields observed
   in 1992 and 1997. We analyzed one 1992 data set and three 1997 data
   sets, each covering several days of continuous drydown. Different
   resolutions were introduced by aggregating the pixels of original 200-m
   resolution into bigger square cells. Scaling in dependencies on
   resolution was observed for the variance of moisture content, for the
   within-cell variance, and for the first six moments about zero, the
   latter indicating multiscaling. Parameters of the scaling equations
   differed among four drying periods studied. However, once a scaling
   dependency on resolution was established in the beginning of a drying
   period, its shape was maintained during the drydown both in 1992 and
   1997. Slopes of the dependencies changed only slightly, whereas the
   intercepts decreased as the drying progressed. Having constant slopes
   and intercepts dependent on average area water contents gives an
   opportunity to reduce the volume of observations needed to predict
   scaling of surface soil moisture during drydowns. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In unconfined aquifers flowing under topographic gradients, the water
   table is a subdued replica of the ground surface above. This principle
   is the basis for using detailed collateral or secondary information from
   digital elevation models to supplement sparse observations from water
   wells in the mapping of phreatic surfaces. Data from DEM-derived
   secondary variables are incorporated into the estimation of water table
   elevations using the geostatistical method known as kriging with an
   external drift (KED). Two different KED models are proposed based on the
   choice of secondary variable. In the first, water table elevation is
   expressed as the sum of a deterministic trend given by topographic
   elevation and a residual random component representing depth to water
   table. In the second, depth to water table is expressed as a linear
   function of a deterministic trend, given by the TOPMODEL topographic
   index, and a residual random error. The relationship between water table
   depth and topographic index is derived from simplified groundwater
   dynamics and forms the basis of TOPMODEL-type rainfall-runoff models.
   The two KED models are applied to the mapping of water table elevations
   in the Oak Ridges Moraine (ORM), an unconfined aquifer near Toronto,
   Canada. Results show that KED with topographic elevation as external
   drift is the more robust of the two models. Despite its strong
   theoretical basis, the second model yields kriged water table elevations
   that are not always physically plausible. In part, this is because field
   observations of water table depth do not verify the predicated
   relationship with topographic index in large parts of the study area.
   However, this relationship may be valid in other cases and at other
   spatial scales. In such cases, the second model would provide a very
   powerful approach for mapping water table elevations and for calibrating
   distributed parameters of the TOPMODEL equations on water well
   observations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A model describing the increase in the relative permittivity of water
   with distance from the soil mineral surface is presented. The model
   assumes an exponential increase in the value of permittivity with
   increasing distance from the mineral surface; arguments are presented
   supporting this approach. The volume of bound water (within the
   bandwidth of time domain reflectometry, (TDR) 0.01-1 GHz) is considered
   to be equivalent to the soil hygroscopic water content. The refractive
   index mixing equation is used as a geometric base into which the model
   is incorporated. The new equation is tested using measurements of
   permittivity collected from two drying undisturbed soil cores that
   contained similar to 10\% hygroscopic water. The RMSE of predicted
   permittivity as a function of water content was found to decrease from
   similar to 3.5 to less than 1. The model was further tested on data
   previously presented in the literature and found to correspond
   reasonably well. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of precipitation events on colloid mobilization were
   evaluated during several storms from six wells in a karstic aquifer at
   the Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant in eastern Tennessee (USA). Turbidity increases
   and rapidly recedes following rain events. Although the magnitude of the
   turbidity increases are relatively small (less than or equal to4.78
   NTU), the increased turbidity suggests transient increases in colloid
   abundance during storm versus non-storm periods. During the larger
   storms (> 19 mm), the increased turbidity is associated with increases
   in pH, total organic carbon (TOC) and temperature, and with decreases in
   dissolved oxygen (DO). These larger storms result in flushing of a
   greater proportion of higher pH, TOC (and lower DO) soil or matrix
   waters into the fractures and conduits than occurs during smaller
   storms. Smaller storms also result in increases in turbidity, but show
   increases in DO and decreases in pH reflecting less influence on the
   water chemistry from the longer residence time epikarst or and matrix
   waters, and greater impact from the more dilute, newly recharged waters.
   Due to the complexity of karst flow and temporal variations in flow and
   chemistry, controls on turbidity are not consistent through time and
   space at the wells. During smaller storms. recharge by lower ionic
   strength waters may promote colloid release and thus contribute to
   observed increases in turbidity. During larger storms, elevated
   turbidity may be more related to pH increases resulting from greater
   influx of matrix and soil waters into fractures and conduits. Chemical
   factors alone cannot account for the changes in turbidity observed
   during the various storms. Because of the complicated nature of flow and
   particle transport in karst aquifers, the presence of colloids during
   precipitation events is dictated by a complex interplay of chemical
   reactions and the effects of physical perturbations due to increased
   flow through the conduits and fractures. Simple trends in water quality
   parameters could not be identified, and broad generalizations cannot
   easily be made in karst settings, and some of the expected correlations
   between chemical parameters during the storms were not observed in this
   work. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An event rainfall-runoff simulation procedure based on the method of
   derived distributions is proposed for the estimation of flood frequency
   for ungauged watersheds. The procedure uses a stochastic rainfall
   generation model and a rainfall-runoff watershed model. The results of
   previous research on rainfall characteristics and watershed response are
   incorporated into the two models. These rainfall characteristics are
   storm depth, storm duration, space and time distribution. The simplified
   watershed model, used in the procedure, has previously been tested and
   given good simulation of the watershed response. Some of the rainfall
   and watershed model parameters are stochastic in nature and are assumed
   to follow various probability distributions. Monte Carlo simulation is
   used for the generation of the various parameter values and simulation
   of the flood hydrographs. After 5000 realizations, the frequency of the
   hourly and daily peak flow and the flood volume is estimated. The
   proposed procedure is applied to eight coastal British Columbia
   watersheds and the results compare well with the observed data and with
   the Extreme Value type I (EVI or Gumbel) fitted probability
   distribution. The method is easy to apply, requires limited regional
   data and is shown to be reliable for small and medium forested
   watersheds with areas ranging from 10 to 600 km(2). Sensitivity analysis
   shows that the procedure is stable and is not sensitive to the number of
   realizations. It is suggested that, given an appropriate adjustment of
   the rainfall generation model and testing and validation, the procedure
   could be used in areas with climates other than that of coastal British
   Columbia. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed uncertainty analysis of three-component mixing models based
   on the Haute-Mentue watershed (Switzerland) is presented. Two types of
   uncertainty are distinguished: the `model uncertainty', which is
   affected by model assumptions, and the `statistical uncertainty', which
   is due to temporal and spatial variability of chemical tracer
   concentrations of components. The statistical uncertainty is studied
   using a Monte Carlo procedure. The model uncertainty is investigated by
   the comparison of four different mixing models all based on the same
   tracers but considering for each component alternative hypotheses about
   their concentration and their spatio-temporal variability. This analysis
   indicates that despite the uncertainty, the flow sources, which generate
   the stream flow are clearly identified at the catchments scale by the
   application of the mixing model. However, the precision and the
   coherence of hydrograph separations can be improved by taking into
   account any available information about the temporal and spatial
   variability of component chemical concentrations. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development and application of a procedure that
   identifies trends in hydrologic variables. The procedure utilizes the
   Mann-Kendall non-parametric test to detect trends, a permutation
   approach to estimate the test distribution, and accounts for the
   correlation structure in the data in determining the significance level
   of the test results. The research investigates 18 hydrologic variables
   that reflect different parts of the hydrologic cycle. The hydrologic
   variables are analyzed for a network of 248 Canadian catchments that are
   considered to reflect natural conditions. A selection of catchments
   identified to have trends in hydrologic variables is studied further to
   investigate the presence of trends in meteorological variables and the
   relationship between the hydrologic and the meteorological response to
   climatic change. It is concluded that a greater number of trends are
   observed than are expected to occur by chance. There are differences in
   the geographic location of significant trends in the hydrologic
   variables investigated implying that impacts are trot spatially uniform.

Abstract = {{In this paper, missing consecutive streamflows are estimated, using the
   principles of chaos theory, in two steps. First, the existence of
   chaotic behavior in the daily flows of the river is investigated. The
   time delay embedding method of reconstructing the phase space of a time
   series is utilized to identify the characteristics of the nonlinear
   deterministic dynamics. Second, the analysis of chaos is used to
   configure two models employed to estimate the missing data, artificial
   neural networks (ANNs) and K-nearest neighbor (K-nn). The results
   indicate the utility of using the analysis of chaos for configuring the
   models. ANN model is configured using the identified correlation
   dimension (measure of chaos), and (K-nn) technique is applied within a
   subspace of the reconstructed attractor. ANNs show some superiority over
   K-nn in estimating the missing data of the English River, which is used
   as a case study. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recognising the utility of grass buffer strips in sediment retention, a
   fundamental hydraulic interpretation of flow through such strips is
   sought. In order to ensure reproducibility of results, a model porous
   resistive element consisting of beds of nails of various densities was
   used to simulate the hydraulic resistance offered by grass strips. In 14
   experiments, the hydraulic consequences were measured for steady flow in
   a flume through nail beds of various densities at various flume slopes.
   A newly devised staining technique was used to measure the spatial
   variation in water depth to and through the resistive element. Provided
   nail density was not too low or slope too high, the maximum depth of
   water occurred as flow entered the nail bed. In such cases. momentum
   theory was able to provide a reasonably good prediction, both of the
   shape of the water profile within the nail bed. and of the slope and
   extent of the region of hydraulic adjustment formed upslope of the
   resistive element. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Natural aquifers are heterogeneous, and geostatistical methods are
   widely used to simulate the heterogeneity of aquifer properties. Due to
   limited available data, it is essential to integrate as much information
   as possible to reduce the uncertainty in aquifer models and flow
   predictions. Traditional geostatistical techniques efficiently consider
   static hard and soft information, such as core data and seismic data.
   However, dynamic flow and transport data, such as flow rates, pressure,
   and tracer breakthrough, are important information that are not easily
   considered with the traditional techniques. Integrating such dynamic
   data into a model requires the solution of a difficult inverse problem,
   since dynamic data and aquifer properties are related to each other
   through the non-linear flow and transport equations.
   A recently developed geostatistically based inverse technique, the
   sequential self-calibration (SSC) method, is introduced to integrate
   those dynamic data. The SSC method is an iterative inverse technique
   that is coupled with an optimization procedure. It provides for fast
   generation of multiple realizations of aquifer property models that
   jointly match pressure and tracer breakthrough data, yet display the
   same geostatistical characteristics. This method is flexible,
   computationally efficient, and robust. The main features of SSC include
   (1) a master point concept that reduces the number of parameters, (2) a
   perturbation mechanism based on kriging that accounts for the spatial
   correlation of the aquifer properties, (3) a fast streamline-based
   tracer flow simulator for integration of tracer data, and (4) a new
   semi-analytical streamline-based method for computing sensitivity
   coefficients of tracer breakthrough.
   Applications of the SSC method are demonstrated with a synthetic data
   set. Results show that tracer breakthrough data carry important
   information on the spatial variation of aquifer permeability in the
   inter-well areas. As a contrast, pressure data provide information at
   near well-bore areas only. Integrating pressure and breakthrough data
   jointly leads to significant improvement in the aquifer heterogeneity
   representation and a reduction in the uncertainty of aquifer model. The
   accuracy of flow and transport predictions can be dramatically improved
   by integrating dynamic data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Simulations with a regional climate model RACMO were carried out over
   the catchment area of the Baltic Sea for the growing season 1995. Two
   different surface schemes were included which in particular differed
   with respect to the parameterization of runoff. In the first scheme
   (taken from ECHAM4), runoff is a function of the subgrid distribution of
   the soil moisture saturation. In the second model (taken from ECMWF),
   runoff is a result of deep-water drainage. A large-scale hydrological
   model of the catchment, HBV-Baltic, was calibrated to river discharge
   data and forced with observed precipitation, yielding independent
   comparison material of runoff of the two RACMO simulations.
   The simulations showed that the temporal and spatial simulation of
   precipitation in the area is sensitive to the choice of the land surface
   scheme in RACMO. This supported the motivation of analysing the land
   surface hydrological budgets in a coupled mode.
   The comparison of RACMO with HBV-Baltic revealed that the frequency
   distribution of runoff in the ECMWF scheme shows very little runoff
   variability at high frequencies, while in ECHAM4 and HBV the snow melt
   and (liquid) precipitation are followed by fast responding runoff
   events.
   The seasonal cycle of soil water depletion and surface evaporation was
   evaluated by comparison of model scores with respect to relative
   humidity. Results suggest that the surface evaporation in the ECMWF
   scheme is too strong in late spring and early summer, giving rise to too
   much drying later in the season. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   flows from relatively unregulated rivers in the KwaZulu-Natal province
   of South Africa has been conducted, including identification of
   homogeneous regions and suitable regional frequency distributions for
   the regions. The study area was divided into two homogeneous regions
   based on an index of monthly rainfall concentration. Region 1 covers the
   coastal and midlands area and Region 2 the west north-western parts of
   the study area. The General Normal, Pearson Type 3 and General Pareto
   distributions were found to be suitable for AMS of flood flows in Region
   2. The occurrence of a few flood events of extreme magnitude in Region 1
   resulted in no suitable regional frequency distribution for this region.

Abstract = {{Forest soils are often covered with a litter that influences the rate of
   mass and energy transfer between the soil and the air above, thereby
   modifying the temperature and moisture fields in the soil. The presence
   of a litter should therefore be accounted for in forest SVAT models,
   especially when long-term simulations are to be performed. A heat and
   moisture litter model has been developed by adding two dynamical
   equations to a force-restore type soil model. The experimental data used
   for the model validation was collected in a pine forest canopy in the
   South-West of France, that was part of the Euroflux network. The model
   is tested and validated over a two-year period. It is shown to provide a
   fairly good simulation of soil and litter moisture, soil and litter
   temperature and turbulent fluxes measured above the forest floor. It is
   also shown that simulations without the litter layer are unable to
   reproduce all these variables simultaneously. We then perform a
   sensitivity analysis to the parameters whose values are either uncertain
   or likely to be variable in time and space, such as the litter
   thickness, the rainfall fraction intercepted by the litter or the
   maximum value of the surface resistance. A threshold value of the litter
   moisture used in the surface resistance parameterisation turns out to be
   the most critical parameter. Further work is needed to investigate the
   possible relationships between the various parameters describing the
   litter, but the present litter model can already be used in combination
   with other forest SVAT models. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Pollution in the shallow subsurface has led to an increasing need of
   understanding how to quantitatively characterize both the heterogeneity
   of gravel aquifers and the influence of heterogeneity on groundwater
   flow and solute transport. Models play an important role in
   decision-making processes, especially in the context of better
   characterizing and in forecasting the behavior of a given geological
   system. The objective of the present paper is the derivation of a
   gradual lithofacies-based interpretation of outcrop, drill core, and
   ground penetrating radar (GPR or georadar) data of different quality.
   The presented method allows a probability estimation of drill core layer
   descriptions and radarfacies types representing defined sedimentary
   structure types. The method includes a determination of `initial
   structure type probabilities' for grain-size categories and combinations
   thereof described in drill core layer descriptions as well as a
   subsequent differentiation of these structure type probabilities in an
   iterative process considering `additional information' like main
   constituent, quantity, fraction, and sorting of single grain-size
   categories, color, chemical precipitation, layer thickness, and adjacent
   layer. The radarfacies types are calibrated with drill cores located in
   the vicinity of georadar sections. The calibration process consists of
   the assignment of the calculated structure type probabilities from the
   drill core layer descriptions to the corresponding radarfacies types
   considering the proportion in thickness between drill core layers and
   georadar structures. The structure type probabilities can be given for
   points along boreholes and a grid with arbitrary mesh size along
   georadar sections. The method is applied to field examples from the
   Rhine/ Wiese aquifer near Basel in Switzerland. The resulting structure
   type probabilities can be used for conditioning stochastic simulations
   of geological models. However, the conditioned stochastic simulation of
   the Rhine/Wiese aquifer is the topic of another paper. The results show
   the importance of a detailed sedimentological analysis of outcrops and
   drill cores as well as its significance on the distinction of
   sedimentary structure types. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In estimating the evaporation from open water, the challenge is to
   accurately quantify the change in heat stored in the water body. A
   simple finite difference model is described and a comparison made
   between measured values of water temperature and evaporation, from a
   reservoir in southeast England, and the values predicted by an
   equilibrium temperature model. The values predicted by the new model are
   in excellent agreement with the measurements and are closer to the
   measured values than those predicted by the equilibrium temperature
   model. The difference in performance is attributed to improved methods
   used for calculating the net radiation and the wind function. The
   simpler formulation of the finite difference model is considered to
   offset the disadvantage of the greater number of calculations required.
