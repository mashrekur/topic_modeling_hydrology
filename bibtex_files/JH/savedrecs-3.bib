Abstract = {{The time-frequency-scale features of high-resolution rainfall are
   investigated in an effort to gain more insight into the
   rainfall-generating mechanism. In particular, we look for the existence
   of persistent and short-lived structures and their associated
   frequencies and time (length) scales, as well as the energy they carry.
   We try to achieve this objective via the wavelet packet representation.
   The best representation for a signal from the point of view of minimum
   entropy (i.e. maximum information in a few coefficients) is obtained,
   and, in the process, we define two measures: (1) best basis spectrum,
   which is analogous to the well-known Fourier spectrum; (2) frequency
   persistence spectrum, a new measure, which in essence gives an idea of
   what scale has been chosen to best represent a particular frequency;
   thus the localization of that frequency in time, whether persistent or
   short lived, is known. We discuss the implications of our analysis in
   separating stratiform and convective components of rain and in gaining
   insight into the rainfall energy cascading mechanism for the purpose of
   model building.}},

Abstract = {{The multifractal behavior of daily spatial rainfall distributions
   observed by a dense gage network in southern Sweden was analyzed by
   studying the variation of average statistical moments with scale. The
   data were analyzed both separated into groups depending on the rainfall
   generating mechanism (warm fronts, cold fronts, and convection,
   respectively) and pooled into one group representing the total rainfall
   process in the area. The results indicated that the daily spatial
   rainfall distributions were well characterized by a multifractal
   behavior both separated into mechanism groups and pooled into one group.
   The multifractal properties, however, displayed distinct differences
   which were related to physical differences of the rainfall generating
   mechanisms. The multifractal properties of the total rainfall process
   agreed well with the properties of the cold front group. Investigations
   of interpolated grids showed that these well preserve the multifractal
   behavior of the original data, but modify the multifractal properties.}},

   or multiple scaling DDF curves from extreme value storm data. This model
   allows for a parsimonious and efficient parametrisation of DDF curves,

Abstract = {{The hypothesis of statistical self-similarity, or scaling invariance, in
   the spatial variability of rainfall, channel network structures and
   floods has been supported by recent advances in data analyses. This
   hypothesis is used here to calculate the statistical scaling exponents
   of peak river flows using a random cascade model of spatial rainfall
   intensities and the Peano basin as an idealized model of a river basin.
   The `maximum contributing set' approximately determines the magnitudes
   of peak flows in a self-similar manner in different subbasins of the
   Peano basin. For an instantaneously applied random, spatially uniform
   rainfall, the Hausdorff dimension of the maximum contributing set
   appears as the statistical simple scaling exponent of peak flows. This
   result is generalized to an instantaneously applied cascade rainfall,
   and it is shown to give rise to statistical multiscaling in peak flows.
   The multiscaling exponent of peak flows is computed and interpreted as a
   Hausdorff dimension of a fractal set supporting rainfall intensity on
   the maximum contributing set of the Peano basin. Potential implications
   of this interpretation are illustrated using the regional food frequency
   analysis of the Appalachian flood data in the United States and a
   rainfall data set from the tropical Atlantic ocean. It is argued that
   the hypothesis of self-similarity identifies a powerful theoretical
   framework which can unify a statistical theory of regional flood
   frequency with important empirical features of topographic, rainfall and
   flood data sets and distributed rainfall-landform-runoff relationships.}},

Abstract = {{The relationships between the local properties of the morphological
   elements of a drainage basin and its drainage structure are analysed.
   Two theoretical approaches are used for which hydrodynamics and basin
   morphology are respectively assumed to represent the lowest and the
   highest starting scale level. The results show a convergence toward the
   idea of slope scaling with contributing area in river networks. This
   concept is then used as an indicator of channel initiation and
   maintenance for the identification of the effective drainage structure
   of the basin on the basis of existing digital elevation models (DEMs).
   Integral properties of the single DEM pixel are finally introduced to
   reduce the noise owing to a possible DEM low accuracy, e.g. in the
   estimation of the local slope value from the elevation data set. The
   resulting network is characterized by a nonuniform drainage density, as
   expected for natural river networks.}},

Abstract = {{Fractal suggestions find interesting applications in the matter of
   stream networks hydraulics. Remarkable results have been obtained about
   the value of fractal dimensions both of a whole network and of a single
   channel. In this paper 17 river networks in Southern Italy are
   investigated in terms of their fractal nature and fractal dimension. The
   results confirm the fractal structure of both river networks and of
   stream channels. Geological constraints and features deriving from the
   maturity of the basins seem to reduce the capability of stream reaches
   to develop a purely branching process. Consequently the fractal
   dimension of stream networks turns out to be appreciably different from
   the one predicted by the topological randomness model, Thus the values
   we found for the fractal dimensions are less than 2 for the networks and
   not equal to 1 for river reaches.}},

Abstract = {{Informational entropy of river networks, as defined by Fiorentino and
   Claps (1992a), proved to be a useful tool in the interpretation of
   several properties exhibited by natural networks. In this paper,
   self-similar properties of river networks are taken as the starting
   point for investigating analogies and differences between natural
   networks and geometric fractal trees, comparing their variability
   entropy with parameters of both classes of networks. Attention is
   directed particularly to relations between entropy and Horton order and
   entropy and topological diameter of subnetworks. Comparisons of these
   relations for fractals and natural networks suggest that network entropy
   can contribute to clarify important points concerning self-similar
   properties of river networks. Moreover, the estimation of the fractal
   dimension of branching for natural networks can be considerably improved
   using the relation between entropy and Horton order throughout the
   network.}},

Abstract = {{Digital elevation models (DEMs) are generally used to automatically map
   the channel network and to delineate subbasins. The most common approach
   to extract a channel network from DEMs consists of specifying a
   threshold area S which is the minimum area required to drain to a point
   for a channel to form. This threshold area is usually specified
   arbitrarily, although it is recognized that different threshold areas
   will result in substantially different channel networks for the same
   basin. In this paper, we study the effect of S (that is also the scale
   of observation) on the morphometric properties (external and internal
   links, length of drainage paths, mainstream length) and scaling
   properties (such as Horton's and Strahler's laws, and fractal
   dimension). Three basins, located in southern France, were extensively
   studied. The results indicate that morphometric properties vary
   considerably with S, and thus values reported without their associated S
   should be used in hydrologic analysis with caution. Then, the fractal
   geometry is used to take into account the dependence of measured values
   on observation scales, which is not possible with classical hydrological
   indexes. The use of fractals allows, first, to point out self-similarity
   in the structure of channel networks and then to quantify the tree-like
   organization. New catchment shape indexes, independent of the
   observation scale S, are defined. These indexes are useful for comparing
   catchments and for measuring the irregularity level of the channel
   network.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis deals with the scaling properties of infinite topologically
   random channel networks (ITRNs) first introduced by Shreve (1967, J.
   Geol., 75: 179-186) to model the branching structure of rivers as a
   random process. The expected configuration of ITRNs displays scaling
   behaviour only asymptotically, when the ruler (or `yardstick') length is
   reduced to a very small extent. The random model can also reproduce
   scaling behaviour at larger ruler lengths if network magnitude and
   diameter are functionally related according to a reported deterministic
   rule. This indicates that subsets of ITRNs can be scaling and, although
   ITRNs are asymptotically plane-filling due to the law of large numbers,
   scaling ITRNs can also display fractional dimension.}},

Abstract = {{The Saint-Venant equations are used to describe river waves. Generally,
   for flood routing in rivers, the Saint-Venant system is reduced to the
   diffusive wave equation which can be resolved using finite-difference
   algorithms. The choice of a numerical method, and of the space and time
   steps to be retained, depends essentially on the form of flood
   hydrographs and the hydraulic properties of the river. This paper
   investigates these areas; two sets of criteria are proposed, the first
   to define parameter ranges representing each wave type and then, in the
   particular case of the diffusive wave model,to define criteria for the
   choice of numerical algorithm and appropriate space and time steps. The
   first analysis was based on the concept that river wave behaviour is
   determined by the balance between friction and inertia. The conclusions
   relate to the magnitude of temporal characteristics of flood waves,
   expressed as a function of the Froude number of the steady uniform how
   and a dimensionless wave number of the unsteady component of the motion.
   The second part discussed questions related to the diffusive wave
   problem and to numerical instabilities. A technique is proposed to guide
   the user in the choice of the computational algorithm and specifies the
   error introduced by numerical methods. The technique was applied to
   flood-routing simulation for the Loire river in France. In this case,
   two finite-difference algorithms were compared to the exact solution
   given by the analytical method. Comparisons between results show the
   efficiency of the technique to optimise the choice of the
   finite-difference method and the adequate space and time steps.}},

Abstract = {{Cedar Bog, a boreal fen in west-central Ohio, is home for many
   endangered plants and animals. The whereabouts of the water source that
   sustains Cedar Bog has been the subject of several investigations in the
   past two decades. Some of these studies indicated that a recharge area
   lies to the east and northeast of the Bog. Using environmental isotopes
   of oxygen and hydrogen, the present study positively identifies a major
   recharge area located northeast of the Bog and enclosed by two small
   tributaries of the Mad River. Oxygen isotopic composition and tritium
   contents of ground water suggest that the Bog water is only a few years
   old.}},

Abstract = {{A series of computer models describing overland flow, pending and
   infiltration was dynamically linked to simulate the movement of water
   during seepage beneath a nuclear subsidence feature. The coupled
   surface-subsurface hydrologic model contains a terrain analysis module,
   an overland bow simulator using the kinematic wave equation and a
   numerical Richards' equation solver to simulate moisture migration
   within the vadose zone. Simulations resulted in successful
   approximations to measured surface and subsurface data. The surface
   water overland flow component was able to reach an agreement between
   observed and simulated water levels following a precipitation event.
   Longterm simulations underpredicted the volumetric water contents and
   depth of moisture fronts. The flux (Darcian velocity) at 10 m below the
   surface was temporally stable with a temporal mean value of 0.75 m
   year(-1), which is in agreement with an earlier estimate of 0.60 m
   year(-1). The mean flux at 5 m below the surface was 1.4 m year(-1).
   Long-term simulations suggest that significant recharge does exist
   beneath surface collapse structures owing to periodic pending.}},

Abstract = {{Regional flood frequency analysis is used for the estimation of floods
   at sites where little or no data are available. It involves the
   identification of groups (or regions) of hydrologically homogeneous
   catchments and the application of a regional estimation method in the
   identified homogeneous region.
   The main objective of this study is to systematically compare various
   regional flood estimation procedures with special emphasis on data from
   the two Canadian provinces, Quebec and Ontario. Four methods for
   delineating homogeneous regions and seven regional estimation methods
   were investigated and these methods are described here. The project was
   specifically aimed at developing new regional estimation techniques (or
   combinations of techniques) and to improve existing methods. Special
   emphasis has been put on non-parametric methods as an alternative to
   classical parametric techniques. The use of partial duration series data
   in a regional context has also been thoroughly explored. An accompanying
   paper (GREHYS, 1996, J. Hydrol., 186: 85-103) provides a detailed
   description of the inter-comparison approaches and of the results
   obtained in the study.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a comparison of regional flood
   frequency procedures. The accuracy of regional quantile estimators as
   predictors of population quantiles at a number of key sites is examined.
   Reference sites have been selected with the basic requirement of at
   least 35 years of local flood records. Accurate at-site estimates of
   population quantiles can therefore be obtained at these locations. The
   regional estimators are used ignoring the local data. This is equivalent
   to flood estimation at an ungauged site. The case of some local
   information (10 years of records) is also considered. The bias and
   variance of the regional estimators are evaluated by comparing at-site
   and regional estimates. Two methodologies have been devised for the
   comparison of regional models: a regional bootstrap approach and an
   empirical Bayes approach. For each approach, a detailed description of
   the results of the various methods considered in the study is provided.
   It was shown that, in general, the two methodologies lead to similar
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Ground water in terrace deposits of the South Platte River alluvial
   aquifer near Greeley, Colorado, USA, had a median nitrate concentration
   of 1857 mu mol l(-1). Median nitrate concentrations in ground water from
   adjacent floodplain deposits (468 mu mol l(-1)) and riverbed sediments
   (461 mu mol l(-1)), both of which are downgradient from the terrace
   deposits, were lower than the median concentration in the terrace
   deposits. The concentrations and delta(15)N values of nitrate and N-2 in
   ground water indicated that denitrifying activity in the floodplain
   deposits and riverbed sediments accounted for 15-30\% of the difference
   in nitrate concentrations. Concentrations of Cl- and SiO2 indicated that
   mixing between river water and ground water in the floodplain deposits
   and riverbed sediments accounted for the remainder of the difference in
   nitrate concentrations. River flux measurements indicated that
   ground-water discharge in a 7.5 ion segment of river had a nitrate load
   of 1718 kg N day(-1) and accounted for about 18\% of the total nitrate
   load in the river at the downstream end of that segment. This nitrate
   load was 70\% less than the load predicted on the basis of the median
   nitrate concentration in the terrace deposits and assuming no
   denitrification or mixing in the aquifer. Water exchange between the
   river and aquifer caused ground water that originally discharged to the
   river to reenter denitrifying sediments in the riverbed and floodplain,
   thereby further decreasing the nitrate load in this stream-aquifer
   system. Results from this study indicated that denitrification and
   mixing within alluvial aquifer sediments may substantially decrease the
   nitrate load added to rivers by discharging ground water.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of the chemical quality of ground water in the unconsolidated
   alluvial aquifer beneath a major urban center (Denver, Colorado, USA)
   was performed in 1993 with the objective of characterizing the quality
   of shallow ground-water in the urban area and relating water quality to
   land use. Thirty randomly selected alluvial wells were each sampled once
   for a broad range of dissolved constituents. The urban land use at each
   well site was sub-classified into one of three land-use settings:
   residential, commercial, and industrial. Shallow ground-water quality
   was highly variable in the urban area and the variability could be
   related to these land-use setting classifications. Sulfate (SO4) was the
   predominant anion in most samples from the residential and commercial
   land-use settings, whereas bicarbonate (HCO3) was the predominant anion
   in samples from the industrial land-use setting, indicating a possible
   shift in redox conditions associated with land use. Only three of 30
   samples had nitrate concentrations that exceeded the US national
   drinking-water standard of 10 mg l(-1) as nitrogen, indicating that
   nitrate contamination of shallow ground water may not be a serious
   problem in this urban area. However, the highest median nitrate
   concentration (4.2 mg l(-1)) was in samples from the residential
   setting, where fertilizer application is assumed to be most intense.
   Twenty-seven of 30 samples had detectable pesticides and nine of 82
   analyzed pesticide compounds were detected at low concentrations,
   indicating that pesticides are widely distributed in shallow ground
   water in this urban area. Although the highest median total pesticide
   concentration (0.17 mu g l(-1)) was in the commercial setting, the
   herbicides prometon and atrazine were found in each land-use setting.
   Similarly, 25 of 29 samples analyzed had detectable volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs) indicating these compounds are also widely distributed
   in this urban area. The total VOC concentrations in sampled wells ranged
   from nondetectable to 23 442 mu g l(-1). Widespread detections and
   occasionally high concentrations point to VOCs as the major
   anthropogenic ground-water impact in this urban environment. Generally,
   the highest VOC concentrations occurred in samples from the industrial
   setting. The most frequently detected VOC was the gasoline additive
   methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE, in 23 of 29 wells). Results from this
   study indicate that the quality of shallow ground water in major urban
   areas can be related to land-use settings. Moreover, some VOCs and
   pesticides may be widely distributed at low concentrations in shallow
   ground water throughout major urban areas. As a result, the
   differentiation between point and non-point sources for these compounds
   in urban areas may be difficult.}},

   aquifers in the wadi systems of the Asir and Hijaz mountains in western

   suitable for estimating recharge in regional aquifers in semi-arid
   areas. Because the method integrates recharge in time and space it
   appears to be, with certain assumptions, particularly well suited for
   and areas with large temporal and spatial variation in recharge. In
   general, recharge was found to be between 3 to 4\% of precipitation - a
   range consistent with recharge rates found in other arid and semi-arid
   areas of the earth.}},

Abstract = {{Processes of evolution of total dissolved inorganic carbon (TDIC) and
   its isotopic composition have been followed by modelling and measurement
   in the catchment of the Waimakariri River and the ground water of the
   section of the Canterbury Plains recharged by infiltration from that
   river. Although the TDIC concentrations are low (maximum 1.2 mmol kg(-1)
   water in this study), clear chemical-isotopic relationships emerge,
   which are consistent with the modelling approach. Total C-14
   concentrations in rivers and shallow ground water are linearly related
   to TDIC, with slope similar to the C-14 concentration of atmospheric CO2
   during the sampling period. UC concentrations of Waimakariri River and
   its tributaries reflect attainment of equilibrium between exchange with
   atmospheric CO2 and direct addition of CO2 to the water by decay of
   organic material. As river water infiltrates to the aquifers
   (fluvioglacial deposits of age several hundred thousand years, mainly
   greywacke), further TDIC accrues by residual decay of organic material
   of recent C-14 concentration. Subsequent changes as the water moves to
   and through the deeper aquifers appear to be limited only to broadening
   of the age spectrum by natural flow processes, accompanied by
   radioactive decay of C-14. This allows age assessment of the
   tritium-free, artesian ground water presently drawn from the deep
   aquifer in near-coastal areas in and close to Christchurch. Based on the
   C-14 evidence alone, mean residence times range from about 800 years
   just outside the confined zone to 2000-3000 years in the confined area.
   A separate age determination uses the C-13 data to evaluate the
   contributions to TDIC of each deep water sample by the river and
   biogenic components at the time of recharge; agreement with the C-14
   residence times is achieved when reasonable pre-industrial C-14
   concentrations are assigned to these two components. The ages appear to
   be in conflict with positive tritium indications during the early 1970s
   and with shorter residence times evaluated from estimates of aquifer
   storage and withdrawals; this suggests that the flow regime has been
   altered by sharply increasing withdrawal during the past 4 decades,
   causing the appearance now of water from deeper levels which has
   remained underground for longer periods as a component of the
   undisturbed flow regime.}},

Title = {{Hydrogeology of thin limestones: The Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological
   Research Site, Northeastern Kansas}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Volume = {{186}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{191-228}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The Konza Prairie Research Natural Area and National Science Foundation
   Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Site is a dissected
   tallgrass-prairie upland located in northeastern Kansas. It is underlain
   by nearly horizontal, alternating thin limestones and shales of Permian
   age and by discontinuous Quaternary alluvium. Shallow aquifers which
   interact with surface-water in this region are an important steady
   source of water to the biota because of sporadic precipitation. This
   study provides a summary of the shallow hydrogeology in a typical
   watershed on the Konza Prairie, including an overview of directions of
   ground-water movement inferred from water-level data and of ground-water
   chemistry. Measurements made every 4 to 6 weeks for over 2.5 years
   provide information on spatial and temporal variability in water
   chemistry and in directions of ground-water flow during the end of a
   drought (first year), during a period of average rainfall (second year)
   and through a period of exceptionally high summer rainfall (third year).
   Well yields from the limestones (each cut by the ephemeral stream
   draining the watershed) are variable and depend upon secondary-porosity
   development. Potential for vertical flow is downward in all units and
   lateral flow directions are sometimes toward and sometimes away from the
   stream. In addition, water levels are sometimes above and sometimes
   below the tops of the aquifers, indicating that aquifers behave
   sometimes as confined and sometimes as unconfined aquifers. The
   stratigraphically and topographically lowest unit monitored (Morrill
   Limestone) is the highest yield aquifer and appears to be hydraulically
   linked to the stream. The uppermost unit studied (upper Eiss Limestone)
   has water chemistry and well yield somewhat similar to the Morrill,
   although there is insufficient well control to establish that it, too,
   is closely linked to the stream. The middle unit (lower Eiss Limestone)
   is characterized by lower hydraulic conductivity, steady water
   chemistry, and higher total dissolved solids than the upper and lower
   units.
   Despite the differing hydraulic behavior of the limestones,
   concentration ranges of the major elements in water samples from the
   aquifers overlap, with the exception of consistently higher dissolved
   magnesium in the lower Eiss Limestone water. Variability in hardness,
   alkalinity, and sulfate, the principal components of the dissolved
   solids, do not clearly distinguish between high- and low-permeability
   aquifers or parts of aquifers. Occasional, easily identified sulfate
   spikes are the result of dissolution of pockets of gypsum or anhydrite
   in the limestones. Relatively long-term, progressive depression of
   sulfate concentrations is probably the result of steady recharge during
   relatively long wet periods, and is a good indicator of flushing of the
   aquifers even though water levels are not elevated. Calcium and
   alkalinity variations at this site reflect variations in recharge as
   modified by seasonal variations in below-ground P-CO2. Calcium/magnesium
   ratios are not constant, indicating that either there is a non-carbonate
   mineral source for magnesium or that more than one carbonate mineral
   (with different magnesium contents) contributes calcium to the water.
   The time-series sampling used in this study revealed information about
   the complicated chemical and hydraulic response of these shallow, thin
   limestone aquifers to variable recharge.}},

Abstract = {{Precipitation and snow distribution, melt of glaciers and snow, and
   runoff formation in two basins in the northern Tien Shan are calculated
   and described. Major climatic features are a spring-summer precipitation
   maximum occurring simultaneously with ice and snow melt. Precipitation
   increases with altitude except in winter when an air temperature
   inversion occurs. Air temperature is a good predictor of glacial melt.
   Typical hydrographs have two hoods: one is formed from melt of seasonal
   snow cover, and the other is formed from melt of glacial ice. The second
   flood is usually larger than the first. In mountain basins of the
   northern Tien Shan direct runoff from rainfall averages about 7-12\% of
   annual volume. The glacial runoff is 18-28\% of average annual runoff in
   basins with area of glaciation not less than 30-40\%, but during summer
   it can increase to 40-70\% of average annual runoff. Surface runoff from
   seasonal snow melt during spring and summer is 18\% of average annual
   runoff; the groundwater component is 34-38\% of average annual runoff.}},

Abstract = {{Tomales Bay has been the site of biogeochemical research on delivery of
   dissolved and particulate materials from land to the bay and nutrient
   cycling within the bay. Because that study seeks to infer controls on
   inputs to the bay and historical changes in the land-bay system as well
   as contemporary processes, a long-term and spatially comprehensive
   hydrological record for the watershed was desired. A multi-cell water
   balance model has been developed based on the analysis by Thornthwaite
   and his colleagues, to estimate both long-term runoff and spatial
   variations of runoff as a function of rainfall, evapotranspiration, and
   field soil moisture capacity. The multi-cell water balance incorporates
   temporal variation in runoff by using monthly rainfall values between
   1879 and 1992 and average monthly evapotranspiration values. Spatial
   variation is addressed by dividing the watershed into grid cells 60 m on
   a side (approximately 160 000 cells in the 561 km(2) watershed),
   calculating the water balance for each cell, and summing the gridpoint
   results into runoff for 18 subwatersheds. Sensitivity analysis
   demonstrates that most of the spatial and temporal variation in annual
   runoff is due to rainfall, rather than either evapotranspiration or held
   soil moisture capacity.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of suspended sediment aggregation on rates of overbank
   deposition and on the grain size composition of deposited sediment were
   investigated using a combined field measurement and numerical modelling
   approach. Measurements of the in situ grain size characteristics of the
   suspended sediment load (termed the effective size distribution) of the
   River Culm, Devon, were obtained using a custom-built water elutriation
   system. Samples of suspended sediment and of sediment deposited on the
   floodplain were analysed in the laboratory to determine the size
   distributions of their constituent discrete mineral particles (termed
   the ultimate size distribution). Interpretation of these field data was
   aided by the development of a two-dimensional finite difference model of
   flood hydraulics and suspended sediment dispersion and deposition. Field
   measurements and model predictions show that particle aggregation
   results in higher relative contributions of fine size fractions to
   overbank deposits. Aggregation may also provide a mechanism for
   explaining the poor agreement between theoretical and observed trends in
   relationships between mean deposit grain size and distance from the main
   channel. Suspended sediment aggregation is shown to cause significant
   increases in rates of floodplain deposition. Increases in deposition
   rates resulting from aggregation may, however, be less than expected
   because of the effects of aggregate shape and density. The latter may
   offset increases in particle size so that the settling velocities of the
   largest aggregates do not increase appreciably with particle diameter.}},

Abstract = {{Sediment discharge generated from snowmelt was observed in the
   Ikushunbetsu River, Hokkaido, Japan (drainage basin area: 60 km(2)) in
   April-May 1992 and April 1993. Continuous records of water discharge Q
   and suspended sediment concentration C-s indicated synchronous temporal
   variations at a station on the riverbank and a downstream increase in
   sediment discharge Q(s)(= Q . C-s) between two stations along a river
   channel. The sediment suspended over 90\% of water depth consisted of
   more than 95 wt.\% of silt (3.91 < d less than or equal to 62.5 mu m)
   and clay (d less than or equal to 3.91 mu m). Sources of the fine
   suspended sediment were identified by comparing grain size distributions
   of riverbed and side gorge slope sediment samples, being supplemented by
   mineralogical analysis. It is concluded that the sediment discharge is
   generated by the fluvial erosion of weathered soils which are
   accumulated on side gorge slopes from the collapse of the top soil, and
   the amount of sediment eroded per unit area per unit time is
   approximately proportional to the fluvial shear stress.}},

Abstract = {{The one-dimensional simultaneous transport of water and solute into
   sandy soil has been studied numerically. Under very dry initial
   condition, a steep pressure gradient and great variation of hydraulic
   conductivity occur across the wetting front during the infiltration of
   water. To compute the steep pressure gradient (and hence the Darcy
   velocity) accurately, various methods of estimation of the internode
   hydraulic conductivity (IHC) have been attempted. The use of a composite
   integration formula to calculate the integrated average expression of
   the IHC was found to be optimal, whereas the use of two-point Gauss
   quadrature led to significant error, which in turn caused apparent error
   in the solute profile. The transport of solute in sandy soil is
   dominated by advection. Oscillation or smearing of the solute profile
   easily results when conventional schemes are used. The numerical
   difficulty is overcome by using the six-point fourth-order (6P4O)
   conservative characteristics based scheme with a flux limiter.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of an underlying very permeable substratum below a uniform
   soil on steady infiltration rates from surface ponds is discussed. The
   steady infiltration rate is the same as that for a deep soil until the
   wetting front reaches the capillary fringe above the water table. The
   soil below the pond then rapidly becomes saturated at a positive
   soil-water pressure with the water table joining with the free water in
   the surface pond, and the infiltration rate is reduced to a new
   steady-state value. For a circular infiltration pond, a shape factor was
   defined to relate this steady rate to the pond radius, the depth of soil
   to the substratum, the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and the
   prevailing artesian pressure. Shape factors for a range of ratios of
   soil depth to pond radius were found from an analytical solution and
   also from numerical solutions of Laplace's equation, using boundary
   conditions that approximated to those of the flow problem. An empirical
   expression for the shape factor is suggested. Infiltration from a
   circular surface pond on a silt loam soil overlying a raised beach
   terrace showed a reduction of the steady infiltration rate when the
   advancing wetting front joined with the underlying capillary fringe.
   Hydraulic conductivity values deduced from the two steady rates were in
   agreement.}},

Abstract = {{The estimation of throughfall to forest systems is an important
   requirement for modelling the hydrology and chemistry of catchments and
   for understanding moisture dependent processes on the forest floor.
   Despite widespread recognition that throughfall is inherently variable,
   relatively few attempts have been made to account for any systematic
   influence canopy architecture may have over throughfall patterns. A
   simple Rutter-type interception model is developed here to include
   spatially distributed parameters which are related to variable canopy
   cover and interception capacity. Evaporation rates are approximated
   using the Penman-Monteith equation and canopy drainage is modelled using
   a negative exponential equation related to canopy wetness. The model was
   calibrated and validated using field observations of throughfall from a
   regular array of funnel collectors installed in a small plot in a Norway
   spruce (Picea abies) plantation in southwest England. The observed
   throughfall patterns had a strong systematic component which was
   strongly correlated with spatially distributed measured canopy cover and
   calibrated canopy capacity. The model was able to reproduce the broad
   trends in observed patterns of throughfall to the plot and was able to
   predict the cumulative total throughfall input to the plot over 77 days
   to within 2\% of the measured input.}},

Pages = {{355-373}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The feasibility of adopting an empirical approach to predicting peak
   nitrate concentrations in water draining agricultural land is examined
   in the light of the relationships derived from leaching experiments on a
   range of soils, and from river data for England and Wales for the period
   1974-1986. Well-fitted linear regressions were obtained of peak nitrate
   concentration in leachate on the annual load of leachable nitrate in the
   soil. The slopes to the regressions ranged in value from greater than
   1.3 for measurements in shallow soils over limestone in a low rainfall
   area, to 0.25 for a well-structured clay soil with mole drainage in a
   high rainfall area. (A slope of 1.0 means that a load of 100 kg N ha(-1)
   gives rise to a peak concentration of 100 mg N l(-1)). This range mainly
   reflected the ranges in soil water capacity and degree of preferential
   flow occurring during drainage. The slopes to the regressions for river
   waters were consistently smaller than those for clay soils in the same
   areas. The slopes for rivers draining mainly low-lying clay or chalk
   catchments in drier areas (Thames, Anglian and Southern Water Authority
   areas) were generally greater than those for rivers draining mainly
   wetter and more upland areas (South West and Welsh Water Authority
   areas). The differences between the slopes to the regressions for rivers
   could be partly accounted for by differences in average rainfall,
   suggesting possible effects from systematic differences in land use,
   soil structure and date of rewetting of soils in different climatic
   areas. The regressions indicated that peak concentrations in excess of
   the European Community limit (11.3 mg l(-1) nitrate-N) might be
   associated with total nitrate loads in rivers draining clay catchments
   of 30 kg N ha(-1) in central and eastern England, or greater than 70 kg
   N ha(-1) in Wales. The results indicate that the regressions for soils
   might form the basis of a catchment-scale model of nitrate leaching,
   provided that it is linked with a hydrogeological sub-model that
   accounts for the contribution to river discharge from upland and
   groundwater sources, and for the effects of different land uses on the
   timing of the peak nitrate concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of soil ion exchange chemistry for predicting streamwater
   quality is evaluated using soil and streamwater chemical data from ten
   upland catchments in NE Scotland. The study catchments vary from those
   dominated by acid hill peats, alpine soils and podzols to those
   dominated by more base-rich soils, including cambisols and gleysols.
   Soil and streamwater chemical data combined with precipitation and
   parent material chemistry are also used to investigate sources and
   pathways of water movement.
   In all soils studied, Ca and Mg are the dominant exchangeable base
   cations in the surface soil horizons. In most soils, Na becomes
   increasingly important on the exchange complex with depth down the soil
   profile. Plots of the relative proportions of Na:Ca:Mg in streamwater
   show that, during periods of high discharge, streamwater chemistry tends
   to become relatively more Na-rich compared with Ca and Mg.
   Using triangular diagrams, streamwater chemistry can be described as a
   mixture of geochemically distinct packages of water derived from
   precipitation inputs, specific parent materials and key soil horizons,
   although spatially important soils within catchments may be relatively
   unimportant in controlling streamwater chemistry. Changes in streamwater
   chemistry at high flow can be explained by dilution of water derived
   from groundwater sources or the B/C horizon, either with laterally
   flowing water from the upper soil horizons, or with precipitation.
   In conclusion, changes in the relative proportions of Na:Ca:Mg in
   streamwater during storms suggest that precipitation chemistry may play
   a greater role than hitherto suggested in modifying solute chemistry
   during periods of high how.}},

Abstract = {{A 980-m-deep well was cored on the Ardeche border of the Southeastern
   basin of France as part of the Deep Geology of France (GPF) programme.
   Hydrogeochemical logging was carried out during drilling, which involved
   the monitoring of physico-chemical parameters (pH, Eh, temperature and
   conductivity), and chemical parameters (concentrations of He, Rn, CO2,
   CH4, O-2, Ca, Cl and SiO2) of the drilling fluid permanently circulating
   in the well. This logging programme was complemented by geophysical
   logging and two hydraulic tests. The combination of these measurements
   enabled identification of a transmissive interval due to fractures in
   the Jurassic carbonates, and of fluid inflow both at the base of the
   porous and slightly permeable Triassic sandstones and from an open
   fracture in the Permian conglomerates. These intervals are marked by
   changes in the drilling-fluid chemistry, such as an increase in chemical
   species content, or a drop in pH. The degree of modification depends on
   the natural permeability of the fractures and the salinity of the
   fluids. The porous and permeable intervals are also marked by He
   anomalies, which act as a tracer for these zones. Comparison between the
   geophysical and hydrogeochemical logs reveals that the latter provide
   information on the liquid phase, whether the fractures are productive or
   not, whereas the geophysical logs are more directly related to the solid
   phase.}},

Title = {{Importance of the vertical component of groundwater flow: A

Abstract = {{Fractured volcanics exert a control on groundwater flow in the San Luis
   Potosi (SLP) valley. The chemical composition and temperature of water
   pumped from boreholes partially penetrating the fractured volcanics
   indicate that the produced water originates from an upward vertical
   flow. Most of the thermal groundwater has been detected in areas related
   to regional faults and lineaments. Intensive and uncontrolled pumping
   from the upper 1/4 of the aquifer (total depth > 1500 m) causes the rise
   of water from a deep regional flow system that mixes with the shallower
   waters. The deep waters contain high fluoride concentrations that
   contaminate the mixture and cause substantial health related effects.
   The recharge controls on the regional flow system require further
   research; however, hydrogeochemical evidence supports the view that the
   origin of this recharge is limited to the western bounding Sierra Madre
   Occidental. Higher levels of dissolved Na+, Li+, F- (and SO4-2) derived
   from Tertiary volcanics have been introduced into the exploited region;
   the concentrations indicate lengthy and deep circulation flow. Li+
   concentration was used as an indicator of groundwater residence time,
   and therefore of the length of the groundwater flow path.
   Hydrogeochemical interpretation indicates the presence of three flow
   systems: a shallow local one controlled by a clay layer that subcrops
   most of the valley floor, an intermediate system in which water
   infiltrates just beyond the boundary of the clay layer, and a deep
   regional system which originates outside the surface catchment. The
   local and intermediate systems circulate through materials with
   comparatively low hydraulic conductivity. Low Cl- concentrations suggest
   rapid flow in the regional system. Concentrations of Li+ and F- can be
   used to calculate percentages of waters in mixtures of regional and
   intermediate flows. Concentrations of Na+, Ca2+ and SO4-2 appear to be
   controlled by water-rock reactions. Uncontrolled pumping increases will
   tend to enhance fluoride concentration and its undesirable effects. Lack
   of management of aquifers in basins similar to the SLP valley can result
   in groundwater contamination, not only from surface anthropogenic
   sources, but also from natural water-rock interactions.}},

Title = {{The optimum order of a Markov chain model for daily rainfall in Nigeria}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},

Pages = {{45-69}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Markov type models are often used to describe the occurrence of daily
   rainfall. Although models of Order 1 have been successfully employed,
   there remains uncertainty concerning the optimum order for such models.
   This paper is concerned with estimation of the optimum order of Markov
   chains and, in particular, the use of objective criteria of the Akaike
   and Bayesian Information Criteria (AIC and BIC, respectively). Using
   daily rainfall series for five stations in Nigeria, it has been found
   that the AIC and BIC estimates vary with month as well as the value of
   the rainfall threshold used to define a wet day. There is no apparent
   system to this variation, although AIC estimates are consistently
   greater than or equal to BIC estimates, with values of the latter
   limited to zero or unity.
   The optimum order is also investigated through generation of synthetic
   sequences of wet and dry days using the transition matrices of zero-,
   first- and second-order Markov chains. It was found that the first-order
   model is superior to the zero-order model in representing the
   characteristics of the historical sequence as judged using frequency
   duration curves. There was no discernible difference between the model
   performance for first- and second-order models. There was no seasonal
   variation in the model performance, which contrasts with the optimum
   models identified using AIC and BIC estimates.
   It is concluded that caution is needed with the use of objective
   criteria for determining the optimum order of the Markov model and that
   the use of frequency duration curves can provide a robust alternative
   method of model identification. Comments are also made on the importance
   of record length and non-stationarity for model identification.}},

Abstract = {{The chemistry of streams draining agricultural and forested catchments
   in the Middle Hills of Nepal is described. Differences between mean
   streamwater chemistry are attributable to the effects of the terraced
   agriculture and land management practices. The agricultural catchments
   were found to exhibit higher mean concentrations of base cations (Na,
   Mg, K), bicarbonate, acid anions (SO4, Cl), metals (Al, Fe) and
   nutrients (NO3, PO4). Increased base cations apparently result from
   tillage practices exposing fresh soil material to weathering. Increased
   acid anions result from inputs of inorganic fertiliser, notably ammonium
   sulphate, and from an apparent increase in evapotranspiration from the
   flooded terraces in the agricultural catchments. Increased metal
   concentrations may be promoted by increased weathering and erosion
   rates, and this is further supported by observations of dramatically
   higher turbidity in the streamwater draining the agricultural
   catchments. Higher levels of nutrients are the direct result of
   fertiliser input but concentrations are generally low from all
   catchments as a result of denitrification, indicating that
   eutrophication downstream is not a likely consequence of land use
   change.
   The major dynamics of water chemistry occur during the monsoon, which is
   also the main season for agricultural production. Mean wet season
   concentrations of base cations tend to be lower than in the dry season
   at all catchments as higher flow dilutes the relatively constant
   weathering input. Ammonium concentrations are higher from the
   agricultural catchments in the wet season as a result of direct washout
   of fertiliser. Detailed monitoring through storm periods at one
   agricultural catchment indicates that the chemistry responds very
   rapidly to changing flow, with cations decreasing and acid anions
   increasing followed by equally rapid recovery as flow recedes.
   Bicarbonate concentrations also decline markedly but are still
   sufficiently high to maintain pH near neutral throughout the storm
   event.
   The impacts of agricultural land use on streamwater chemistry are
   unlikely to lead to potentially damaging consequences for the aquatic
   biota at present or in the short-term future. The potential for acidity
   generation as a result of the high loads of nitrogenous fertilisers
   applied is apparently buffered by the land tillage practices, which
   promote higher weathering and so higher concentrations of base cations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the application of a transient three-dimensional
   groundwater model to simulate water flux through a floodplain wetland,
   Narborough Bog, in Central England. The results of a programme of
   water-table monitoring are summarised to indicate the extent of
   water-table fluctuation, and experiments to determine hydraulic flow
   parameters are detailed. Hydraulic conductivities of deposits are highly
   variable; observations were in the range 1.16 x 10(-3)-4.63 x 10(-2) cm
   s(-1) for herbaceous peat, 1.16 10(-4) cm s(-1) for wood peat, and 9.14
   x 10(-6)-3.36 x 10(-8) cm s(-1) for silty clay. A three-layer
   groundwater model of the wetland is developed using MODFLOW from these
   initial values, and with stratigraphic data obtained by hand augering.
   The model is calibrated using data for two periods of recharge from
   precipitation by adjusting specific yield and vertical hydraulic
   conductivity within prescribed limits. The accuracy of the model is then
   assessed by comparing daily model predictions of water-table response to
   potential evapotranspiration at specific monitoring points. Model
   results demonstrate the importance of variation in hydraulic
   characteristics with depth in wetlands, thus emphasizing the dependence
   of water-table response upon water-table position, and preceding
   moisture conditions. The resulting water-table configuration reflects
   the balance between horizontal and lateral water flow through the
   wetland, and its relationship to river stage. The success of the
   stratigraphic representation is considered and its general applicability
   evaluated. Finally, the use of the calibrated model for local
   hydrological management is considered, and the effects on the wetland
   water budget of varying river stage by specified amounts are examined.}},

Abstract = {{Construction of hydraulic-head surface (HHS) maps is the most commonly
   used technique for groundwater evaluation. A review of methods used for
   constructing HHS maps showed that, of the manual methods, the
   hydrogeological interpretative technique produces a better surface than
   the equally spaced approach. Geostatistical methods gave similar
   surfaces to the manual methods; they share the problem of groundwater
   contours intersecting surface contours and the inability to identify
   groundwater discharge areas. The results showed that the automated
   hydrogeological-GIS (geographical information system) techniques, which
   take into account the hydrogeomorphic and topographic controls, produced
   the most realistic surfaces. Groundwater contours follow the
   hydrogeomorphic trends, do not intersect surface contours and can
   properly identify areas of groundwater discharge. The major advantage of
   the hydrogeological-GIS technique is the ability to prepare HHS maps
   with a small number of data points. It is also possible to use
   regressions from other catchments to prepare HHS maps for catchments
   with similar hydrogeomorphic characteristics and elevation ranges but
   which have no data.}},

Abstract = {{A new sensor for field measurements of the water content of natural
   soils has been developed. The measurement quantity is the complex
   permittivity at a frequency of 32 MHz; it is derived by an impedance
   measurement with a capacitive sensor of a fork-like geometry, which was
   found to the best geometry for field use. The impedance is measured with
   a twin T-bridge which has been optimized to cover the extremely large
   range of permittivities of natural soils. An analysis of measured soil
   permittivities showed a dominant influence of liquid water content on
   dielectric permittivity, whereas soil-specific parameters such as
   grain-size distribution, chemical composition and bulk density have only
   a negligible influence at this comparable high measurement frequency.
   The loss factor, however, depends strongly on both the type of soil and
   the water content. In addition, comparative studies with commonly used
   measurement methods such as the thermogravimetric method and time domain
   reflectometry showed satisfactory agreement. As an application of
   practical interest, a field measurement of a vertical water content
   distribution at a snow-soil interface is presented.}},

Abstract = {{A biophysically based model (WAVES) is described which predicts the
   dynamic interactions within the soil-vegetation-atmosphere system. The
   physiological control on transpiration is a canopy resistance calculated
   as a function of net CO2 assimilation rate, the vapour pressure deficit
   and the CO2 concentration at the leaf surface. The soil hydrology is
   modelled using the Richards equation and evapotranspiration is
   calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation. A unique feature of the
   model is the modification of the vapour pressure deficit below the
   canopy as a function of the degree of atmospheric coupling.
   The model was tested using the energy flux and soil moisture
   measurements from the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE) and
   Hydrologic Atmospheric Pilot Experiment and Modelisation du Bilan
   Hydrique (HAPEX-MOBILHY). The simulated net radiation,
   evapotranspiration and soil moisture content agreed well with the
   observations and with previous studies of transpiration and soil
   evaporation. The success of the model was due to the reasonably
   realistic treatment of the soil and canopy processes. The utility and
   limitations of the model are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a method that may lead to a better
   quantitative insight into the relation between the size (horizontal
   dimensions) of a natural groundwater flow modelling area and the
   schematization required for a numerical model. The method is based on a
   decomposition of the spatial variability of the groundwater table into a
   Fourier series. Each sinusoidal Fourier mode has a specific wavelength
   that can be considered as a measure of the scale represented by the
   mode. Modes with small wavelengths correspond to local differences in
   the groundwater table and modes with large wavelengths correspond to
   regional differences in the groundwater table. The contribution of each
   individual Fourier mode to the groundwater flow at a certain depth can
   be determined. This offers the opportunity to evaluate which details in
   the variation of the groundwater table should be taken into account in a
   certain numerical model. A penetration depth is defined and used to
   determine the depth over which the groundwater flow pattern is
   significantly influenced by a certain Fourier mode. Such an analysis can
   be performed for each important Fourier mode in the problem under
   consideration. This approach results in simple algebraic expressions to
   assess grid size and the vertical dimension of a numerical model.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a linear, spatially distributed model for the
   rainfall-runoff process based on a system analysis approach. A watershed
   is treated as a system that consists of a number of subwater-sheds, each
   of which is assumed to be approximately uniform in terms of rainfall
   excess and geographic conditions. An ordinary differential equation
   representing the relationship between the input, output and function of
   the subwatershed is derived based on the mass balance principle and a
   storage-release equation. A number of ordinary differential equations
   for subwatersheds in series or parallel are assembled to form an overall
   equation for the watershed system. The rainfall excess process of each
   subwatershed is represented by a unit-step function. The Laplace
   transform of rainfall excess was taken and substituted into the
   watershed system equation to obtain the Laplace transform of the outflow
   hydrograph of the watershed. The analytical solution for calculating the
   outflow hydrograph was finally obtained by taking the inverse Laplace
   transform. This model, with a much simpler form than numerical
   convolution, is capable of predicting runoff from non-uniformly
   distributed rainfall and geographical conditions over an entire
   watershed.}},

Abstract = {{Under arid natural conditions, soil water content governs and limits the
   number and size of perennial plant species. Thus, plant-available soil
   water is the main constraint for sustainable control of desert
   encroachment. To evaluate possibilities for re-vegetation of bare sand
   surfaces, soil water and temperature patterns for typical sand dunes in
   a desert climate were investigated. Bare and vegetated soil transects
   were selected for observation of soil water content and temperature. The
   investigated soil transects covered crest-to-crest spacings (about 60 m
   horizontally and 15 m vertically) in a shifting sand dune area.
   Observations were made at Shapotou field research station bordering the
   Tengger Desert in Northwestern China. The paper presents two-dimensional
   properties of soil water content (0.1-3.0 m depth) and temperature
   (0-1.0 m depth) before and after rainfall. Rainfall (15-22 mm) affected
   soil water distribution down to 1.5-2.0 m and temperature distribution
   down to 1.0 m. Soil water appeared to be transported through the
   apparently highly pervious and homogeneous sand along the dune slopes.
   High water contents and, thus, infiltration occurred mainly at the
   non-sloping parts, i.e. the dune crests and bottoms. Rainfall changed
   the temperature patterns from a mainly horizontally layered appearance
   before the rainfall to increasingly vertically shaped patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Lakes Clifton, Hayward, and Preston, Western Australia, are part of an
   east-west chain of 11 ground-water-fed lakes that make up the
   Clifton-Preston Lakeland system. Their hydrochemistries exhibit a large
   range in salinities (14-207 kg m(-3) total dissolved solids (TDS)) both
   seasonally within each lake and among lakes. The chemistry of all the
   lake waters in the system is an Na-Cl-SO4 brine, similar to seawater
   composition. However, all three lakes have less SO4, Br, Sr, Mn, and
   probably Fe than seawater; the concentrations of Ca and HCO3 vary
   seasonally. The variation of Ca and HCO3 in all three lakes suggests
   that calcium carbonate is precipitated during the late summer and early
   autumn when evaporation is most intense. In the upper and lower water
   layers of Lake Hayward the concentrations of conservative ions such as
   Na, Cl, and K decrease in winter and increase in summer, indicating
   dilution by winter rain and concentration via evaporation in the summer.
   Concentrations of total Fe and Mn in the lower layer increase in winter,
   suggesting release from the sediments and/or decay of the benthic
   microbial mat on the lake floor. TIN (total inorganic nitrogen)/PO4-P
   ratios and TN (total nitrogen)/PO4-P ratios are high in all lakes,
   suggesting that P is the limiting nutrient in the system. Observed
   increases of the macroalgae Cladophora in Lake Clifton suggest that any
   potential increase in the PO4 load to the lake will be taken up by the
   invigorated growth of these algae and may not be detected by measuring
   lake water PO4 concentrations. The increased growth of Cladophora is
   detrimental to the health of the well-established microbialite community

   Accounting and Routing (SMAR) model to demonstrate one application of

   four catchments with different climatic conditions. The results show
   that the SMARY model performs better than the SMAR model in terms of

   a more rational interpretation of the physical process of infiltration

Abstract = {{Four streams were monitored intensively over a 2 year period. Factor
   analysis was used to identify interrelationships between dissolved
   species during this period, and to determine physical processes
   controlling their behaviour. Analysis of the full dataset identified
   species which varied predominantly on an episodic timescale, and species
   which were subject to seasonal cycles. Two-month subsets of data were
   defined to remove the influence of seasonal cycles, and factor analysis
   of individual subsets then allowed episodic behaviour to be examined for
   each 2 month period. Results showed that base cation dilution was a
   consistent cause of changes in acid neutralising capacity (ANC) in all
   four streams. NO3- exhibited strong seasonality in concentration and
   also in episode behaviour, increasing during winter-snowmelt episodes,
   but diluting during some summer episodes. DOC concentrations also varied
   seasonally, but 2 month analysis indicated episodic increases during all
   periods. SO42- did not exhibit consistent episodic behaviour, as it was
   strongly influenced by antecedent conditions. Behaviour of Ca2+ and Mg2+
   was apparently influenced by a significant soil source in three of the
   streams.}},

Title = {{Rainfall interception near a forest edge}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{185}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{349-361}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The process of interception is studied by comparing observations of net
   rainfall near a wind exposed forest edge with simulations of evaporation
   from a wet canopy. The simulations show a strong enhancement of the
   evaporation rate from the wet forest canopy near the upwind edge. The
   increased evaporation rate should result in an increased interception
   loss and a decreased throughfall near the edge. Observed throughfall
   appears hardly dependent on fetch from the forest edge, in agreement
   with previously published results. The seeming discrepancy between model
   and observations is explained by effects of humidity and wind velocity.
   The model simulates interaction between the surface and the lower
   atmosphere. It is argued that this interaction is suppressed for
   humidity variations, as the atmospheric humidity is influenced by
   evaporation of falling rain. Even by prescribing a constant atmospheric
   humidity, the model simulates a higher evaporation rate near the edge as
   wind velocity is increased near the edge. However, observations show
   that throughfall is statistically independent of wind velocity during
   rain, which is explained by a decrease in water storage capacity of the
   forest. It is concluded that the concept of a constant water storage
   capacity is questionable. Direct observations of water storage are
   recommended to quantify possible sensitivities of water storage capacity
   to environmental factors. For aggregation studies it is concluded that
   rainfall interception is basically independent of patch size. However,
   it is argued that the forest edge dries more quickly and transpiration
   may start sooner after the rain has stopped. This would result in an
   aggregation problem for transpiration.}},

Abstract = {{The original stochastic interception model (Calder, 1986, J. Hydrol.,
   89: 65-71) showed, through the use of Poisson probability statistics,
   that the rate at which vegetation canopies are wetted is dependent on
   the volume of the individual raindrops; for the same depth of rain
   applied, a greater depth of water will be retained on the canopy when
   raindrop volumes are small. This paper recognizes that vegetation
   canopies are wetted through both the primary impact of raindrops to the
   top layer of the canopy and secondary impacts, from drops falling from
   the vegetation, to lower layers of the canopy. It shows how drop volumes
   of primary raindrops can be calculated from the Marshall-Palmer
   distribution and drop volumes of secondary drops can be calculated from
   the `characteristic' volume appropriate to the particular vegetation
   species. A two-layer stochastic model is described which calculates the
   rate at which canopies are wetted in relation to both primary and
   secondary drops. The paper also shows that, in addition to the
   volume-dependent stochastic wetting effect, there is also another
   drop-size-dependent wetting effect, related to the kinetic energy of the
   raindrops, which influences the maximum storage that can be achieved on
   the canopy. The wetting functions predicted for canopies of different
   density are described and the application of the model for assessing
   interception loss from forests, in relation to vegetation, climate and
   possible climatic change, is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the application of a two-layer stochastic model of
   rainfall interception in modelling the interception loss from tropical
   forest (Kandyan Forest Garden), in Sri Lanka. A small data set collected
   at a Kandyan Forest Garden site near Randy has been used to illustrate
   the performance of the model. The model simulates the asymptotic wetting
   of tree canopies and accounts for the effects of changing drop size,
   resulting from changing rainfall intensity and drop modification by the
   canopy, on the canopy storage capacity. The net rainfall predicted by
   the model is compared with the measured net rainfall at 5 min intervals
   as well as with the predictions of the widely used Rutter model. The
   two-layer stochastic model performed better in that it accounted for
   76\% of the variance, compared with 21\% accounted for by the Rutter
   model using parameters optimised to minimise the sums of squares of the
   differences between the measured and predicted cumulative net rainfall.
   The improved performance of the stochastic model is due largely to the
   improved prediction of the net rainfall during the initial wetting phase
   of the storm.}},

Abstract = {{Correct simulation of soil water fluxes in the unsaturated zone is
   needed for studies on leaching of contaminants. Both hysteresis and

   Hysteresis of the soil water characteristic and preferential flow in the
   case of water repellent soils were incorporated in a general
   agrohydrological numerical model. The model was applied to data sets
   from two locations with hysteretic and water repellent soils. It is
   shown that hysteresis retards soil water movement, while preferential
   flow enhances soil water movement. During infiltration events,
   hysteresis retains more water in the root zone than the amount computed
   for reference simulations that neglect hysteresis. However, generally in
   field conditions incorporation of hysteresis decreases the amount of
   simulated water storage. Furthermore, it is shown that in fields with
   shallow water tables and without pending, soil water fluxes are
   marginally affected by hysteresis and preferential flow. However,
   preferential flow directly affects the residence time of solutes in the

Abstract = {{The relationship between the austral spring Southern Oscillation Index
   (SOI) and the austral summer runoff is investigated for a broad,
   contiguous region (20 000 km(2)) of the Southern Alps, New Zealand,
   representing 70\% of the length of the Alps. Using a Bayesian method
   developed in an earlier study (Moss et al., 1994, Water Resour. Res.,
   30(10): 2717-2723), probabilities of summer inflows to alpine lakes when
   the spring SOI is positive (La Nina conditions) are shown to be
   significantly larger than in springs when SOI is neutral or negative (El
   Nino conditions). This has major economic significance because the lakes
   feed hydroelectric power plants that produce typically 43\% of the
   electrical energy used in New Zealand. The lake inflows peak in spring
   and summer, and use of the available controlled storage must be
   scheduled carefully to meet power demands that peak in winter. We
   hypothesise that this occurs because in springs with La Nina conditions,
   there is a relative absence of snow accumulation, and hence less summer
   snowmelt.}},

Abstract = {{For most wetlands precipitation and evapotranspiration are the major
   components of water gain and loss. However, studies of the hydrology of
   wetlands largely ignore evaporation, or calculate it by difference or
   some very simple measure. As part of an integrated study of the
   hydrology and ecology of wetlands in the Indiana Dunes National
   Lakeshore, evaporation was measured directly as its energy equivalent,
   the latent heat flux, using eddy correlation techniques for a 10 day
   period in June 1994. In addition, data were collected on the other
   surface energy balance fluxes (net all-wave radiation and sensible heat
   flux), and ancillary meteorological variables (wind speed and direction,
   temperature, pressure, relative humidity, solar radiation and water
   depth). Overall, latent heat flux dissipated 48\% of the available
   radiant energy, storage heat flux 35\%, and sensible heat flux 17\%. A
   simple hysteresis model for the storage heat flux was developed which
   performed extremely well. Proximity to Lake Michigan resulted in
   evaporation rates close to the equilibrium rate (average
   Priestley-Taylor alpha = 1.035), which were affected strongly by net
   all-wave radiation. Three commonly used models of evaporation, Penman,
   Priestley-Taylor (alpha = 1.26) and equilibrium (alpha = 1.0) are
   evaluated. The relative success of the equilibrium model, with its
   limited data requirements, offers great potential for longer-term
   modeling of water and energy exchanges in this type of wetland
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Observational studies of Sacramento Basin annual mean streamflow
   response to precipitation and temperature indicate that streamflow
   amounts in the basin are strongly sensitive to precipitation, but
   virtually insensitive to mean seasonal temperature. This result is in
   accord with studies of the climate mean sensitivity of streamflow amount
   to changes in climatological mean precipitation and temperature as
   simulated by conceptual hydrological models of the basin. Simpler
   regression models of the Sacramento Basin show a strong dependence of
   streamflow amount on temperature, which is not evident in the
   observation-based annual mean streamflow sensitivity. The interannual
   variability in Sacramento Basin streamflow response to precipitation
   exhibits substantial nonlinearity in that the partitioning of
   precipitation to runoff strongly depends on the precipitation volume.
   During very wet years in the basin, streamflow response to precipitation
   exhibits a proportionally greater change (increase) than during normal
   or dry years. For most dry years in the basin the streamflow response to
   precipitation is fairly linear. However, on the tails of droughts the
   streamflow response to precipitation is diminished relative to other dry
   years. This implies that a shift to a much drier or more drought-prone
   climate would result in a more substantial reduction in streamflow
   amounts than might at present be expected from observations of
   streamflow responses in isolated dry years. This conclusion assumes no
   changes in the features controlling water retention in the basin, which
   is an important issue to be addressed in basin climate change studies.}},

Abstract = {{A decision support system for fitting stage-discharge relations is being
   developed by the University of Manitoba, Facility for Intelligent
   Decision Support, for Environment Canada's hydrometric program. The
   process of developing and applying stage-discharge relationships has
   been documented, the decision support system framework established, and
   a number of expert `rules' developed and evaluated for stable and
   non-stable channels. The system categorizes stage-discharge rating
   curves as stable if they deviate within a predetermined accuracy (e.g.
   +/- 5\% of discharge), or if one of a suite of curves can be applied
   within the predetermined accuracy specifications for given changes in
   the energy slope caused by weed growth, channel ice and other conditions
   affecting backwater. Non-stable channels are defined as channels that
   experience evolution or abrupt changes in stage-discharge relationships
   resulting from changes in channel form. Rating curve stability is
   determined based on deviations in the stage-discharge relationship,
   utilizing specific gauge, absolute differences between sequential
   streamflow measurements and an analysis of residuals. Periods of
   instability, such as a meander cut-off changing the hydraulic control,
   are often repetitive in hydraulic response, such that a pattern of
   instability is recognizable as events occur. In addition, periods of
   instability are interspersed with periods of stability. The repetition
   in pattern allows knowledge of correctly identified historic events to
   be applied to contemporary hydraulic conditions. A suite of rating
   curves can be developed for specific periods (e.g. summer weed growth)
   and stages. These curves can be automatically applied based on changing
   streamflow conditions such that streamflow estimates can be generated in
   a rigorous and accurate manner with minimal hydrographer intervention.}},

Abstract = {{This work addresses operational forecasting of orographic rainfall for
   hydrologic modeling. The forecast model formulation builds on existing
   work and proposes a moisture source parameterization which accounts for
   the primary mechanisms of precipitation processes and conditions in
   mountainous regions. Specifically, the issue of orographic rainfall is
   addressed utilizing two components to represent the water vapor sources.
   One component is associated with the mesoscale rain system in the
   absence of orography. This component is defined during a particular rain
   event using radar observations and a discrete water budget analysis over
   a fixed region of the rain field. The second source term is orographic
   in nature and is a function of the average wind vector and the ground
   slope at the location of interest. The orographic moisture source term
   is additive to the contribution from the mesoscale source. The result is
   a rainfall forecasting model with an explicit physics-based orographic
   component and a relatively straightforward parameterization. Model
   performance is illustrated using two rainfall events observed by radar
   in the Cevennes region of France; 1 h lead-time rainfall forecasts for
   three watersheds in this mountainous region are evaluated. One event is
   used for calibration of the model and the second event is used for
   validation. The proposed model formulation is shown to perform either as
   well as or slightly better than the simplified approaches of persistence
   and advection forecasts. Additional evaluations of the approach with
   data from other regions remains necessary for making comprehensive
   conclusions about the proposed formulation. This work shows the
   importance of obtaining information about the moisture input sources so
   as to increase the information defining the rain water source. Observing
   and forecasting rainfall rate alone does not explicitly account for the
   source of moisture that is transformed into rainfall at a future time.
   This work shows that a limit on forecast lead-time may be related to the
   response time of the precipitating cloud system.}},

Abstract = {{An analytic solution is derived for the one-dimensional equations
   governing the transport of a tracer in a heterogeneous porous medium
   subject to rate-limited adsorption with a linear equilibrium isotherm,
   and also subject to decay. The kinetics of solute adsorption is given by
   a first-order rate law. The medium is semi-infinite, and periodic
   boundary conditions are imposed at the inlet boundary. Both
   Dirichlet-type and flux-type boundary conditions are examined. The
   heterogeneity arises from the assumption of a scale-dependent dispersion
   coefficient that increases exponentially as a function of distance up to
   some constant limiting value. Solutions are given in terms of
   hypergeometric functions, and comparisons are made with the
   corresponding problem in a homogeneous medium with a constant
   dispersion. The one-dimensional model gives information about how
   adsorption and decay effects can interact with heterogeneities in the
   medium. For example, when both adsorption and decay are present, the
   amplitude of waves in a homogeneous medium can exceed that in a
   heterogeneous medium, even though the latter has smaller dispersivity.
   In addition, because the input is periodic, breakthrough curves measured
   downstream have both an amplitude and phase shift; measurement of the
   latter may give additional information for determining medium
   characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The association of snowcover depth with topography and land cover was
   examined for a 1.5 km(2) agricultural site in the Canadian Prairies.
   Topography was quantified by a suite of general geomorphometric
   variables that were measured directly by the analysis of a raster
   digital elevation model (DEM) with a 10 m grid cell size. These
   variables expressed local surface morphology and relative topographic
   position. The major land covers represented in the study area were wheat
   stubble and summerfallow. Point observations of snow depth at the site
   were obtained near the time of peak snow accumulation and during melt.
   Initial analysis was made of scatterplots and correlations between snow
   depth and individual topographic variables. These correlations were weak
   but illustrated that, at the local scale, snow depth patterns cannot be
   adequately modelled through simple bivariate relationships with
   topographic variables. The correlations also showed that snow depth is
   more strongly related to relative topographic position variables than to
   variables expressing local surface morphology. Subsequent analysis
   involved a divisive subdivision of the study site into six terrain units
   defined in terms of several relative topographic position and land cover
   variables. The units were used to model the spatial patterns of snow
   depth that occurred during the observed snowcover situations. Although
   the terrain classification only reduced the total snow depth variance by
   approximately 30\%, it delineated the major patterns of snow depth
   observed over the study area and elucidated the spatial relationships
   between snowcover depth and landscape attributes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of a deterministic-empirical model
   that can simulate total streamflow and the components of the stream
   hydrograph in near-stream wetland regions. The model treats the
   watershed in terms of three zones with differing storage
   characteristics, and accommodates the dynamic flow system that occurs
   owing to the influence of the capillary fringe. It accounts for the
   expansion and contraction of near-stream saturated regions, the large
   and rapid rise in the water table and the development and decay of the
   water-table mound, which result from the decreasing storage capacity
   toward the stream. The overland flow and the groundwater flow components
   of the stream are calculated accounting for the increased hydraulic
   gradient toward the stream and the development and expansion of the
   seepage face. Using relatively modest input, the model incorporates the
   effect of the capillary fringe mechanism for the purpose of improving
   the runoff prediction capability in shallow water-table regions.}},

Abstract = {{The testing and application of HECNAR, a deterministic-empirical model
   that can account for the hydrologic effect of the capillary fringe on
   the near-stream area runoff, was carried out in several steps. The model
   was tested against the response of a laboratory model which resembled a
   near-stream saturated region of a cross-section, and the results of a
   field experiment. In each case, the simulated flow components were
   compared with the separated hydrograph components using a conservative
   tracer and the predictions of an unsaturated-saturated numerical model.
   The results were in reasonably good agreement. The model was then
   applied to a mine tailings site and the predictions were compared with
   numerical simulations, measured streamflows and the components of the
   stream hydrograph separated using O-18 as a conservative tracer. The
   predictions of HECNAR and the numerical. model were in good agreement,
   as were the trends of the simulated and the measured hydrographs.
   However, some discrepancies existed between the measured and the
   simulated flows. This study shows that HECNAR is computer efficient and
   has a relatively modest input requirement. Incorporation of the model
   into a larger-scale and more comprehensive watershed model could provide
   a valuable tool to quantify total flows and runoff source components to
   the stream, in watersheds in humid environments.}},

Title = {{Characterisation of hydrogeologically significant fracture distributions

Abstract = {{Fractures pervade the Chalk, and are the primary pathways for rapid flow
   and contaminant migration. Improved quantitative descriptions of their
   geometry and scaling characteristics are essential for the development
   of predictive transport models. Fracture aperture and fracture
   connectivity are the most critical properties in controlling transport.
   To provide examples of fracture characteristics in the Upper Chalk, four
   fracture parameters-fracture orientation, trace length, spacing and
   aperture-have been measured using section and scan-line surveys at Play
   Hatch Quarry, near Reading, Berkshire. Three fracture types have been
   investigated: joints, bedding plane fractures and faults. Unrefined, or
   global, joint trace length and spacing measurements approximate to
   negative exponential distributions, with means of 0.09 m and 0.02 m. The
   trace length and spacing distributions of the two dominant joint sets,
   i.e. the bedding parallel joint set and the joints at a high angle to
   bedding, approximate to log-normal distributions, with geometric mean
   trace lengths of 0.15 m and 0.3 m, and spacings of 0.10 m and 0.12 m,
   respectively. Calculated fracture interconnectivity indices suggest that
   the bedding parallel joint set is likely to be of greater hydraulic
   importance than the high-angle joint set. Aperture measurements obtained
   for a single bedding plane fracture range from less than 0.5 mm to 23.5
   mm. Apertures approximate to a negative exponential distribution below 7
   mm, and to a log-normal distribution above 7 mm. It is inferred that the
   larger apertures have been affected by solution processes and that flow
   through bedding plane fractures is channelled across 10-20\% of the
   fracture surface area. There are insufficient data for a rigorous
   analysis of the faulting at Play Hatch Quarry, but it is expected that
   faulting in the Chalk will show scale-invariant length and spacing
   characteristics. The results of the study are consistent with a
   visualisation of the Chalk consisting of scale-invariant fault-bounded
   segments, where the internal fracture architecture of each segment is
   dominated by continuous bedding plane fractures, and subordinate,
   scale-dependent, arrays of joints. The scale of jointing within a given
   fault-bounded segment is a function of bedding thickness.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to outline the pathways through which soil
   moisture and meteorological phenomena mutually influence one another at
   local, regional and global scales. This constitutes two-way
   land-atmosphere interaction, as meteorological phenomena both act as the
   forcing and react to the forcing by the soil moisture state. Land
   surface modification of the atmospheric environment and the atmospheric
   forcing of these land surface conditions form feedback loops which are
   significant factors in modulating the variability of the climatic
   system. The predictability and analysis of fluctuations and changes in
   regional hydrology and the atmospheric environment require an
   understanding of these feedback mechanisms and two-way land-atmosphere
   interaction.
   The dynamics of soil moisture at the land surface is governed by
   components with diverse time scales. Variability in both weather and
   climate are therefore influenced by the soil moisture state. In this
   paper, we present an overview of several studies on the mutual
   interaction of the soil moisture state and the atmospheric environment.
   We also outline possible directions for innovative investigations on the
   determination of soil moisture variation influences on the moist
   thermodynamics, energetics and dynamics of the overlying atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Soil moisture-atmosphere interaction is recognized to play a role in the
   dynamics of long-lasting spatial anomalies of continental climates. A
   simple analytical model is formulated and analysed, which represents the
   soil moisture balance subjected to atmospheric forcing. The interaction
   between the soil moisture and the atmosphere is included in the form of
   a convolution integral, whose kernel represents the space-time feedbacks
   of the soil state on its own forcing. The conditions under which the
   model predicts the birth and growth of long-lasting spatial soil
   moisture anomalies are studied. Particular properties of the feedback
   kernel, such as the requirement of the simultaneous presence of an
   activation and an inhibition component, are identified. The existence of
   specific feedbacks of soil moisture on precipitation, as the main
   moisture forcing, is then addressed on the basis of some examples from
   the existing literature, with particular reference to the unforced
   convective and frontal-stratiform precipitation dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{With the qualities and properties of soil not being uniformly
   distributed across continents, soils are classified according to their
   morphological features, genesis and soil-forming processes. Because
   properties of soils vary across the landscape, a relationship observed
   at one location may not be applicable for other locations. Hence,
   measured data and deduced relationships are location specific and should
   be interpreted with information regarding the particular soil type
   according to the discipline of soil science. To better understand the
   role of water in land-atmosphere interactions and the role of
   land-atmosphere interactions in regional and global climate, spatial and
   temporal observations of water in the soil surface can be more
   comprehensively analyzed with a knowledge of soil science. On the other
   hand, an opportunity to strengthen the discipline of soil science (with
   its various branches of soil physics, soil chemistry, soil microbiology,
   etc.) exists if spatial and temporal observations of water in the soil
   surface at different scales are considered. Anticipating that such
   observations of soil water will eventually become more abundantly
   available through satellite imagery, we discuss how they can be used to
   improve our understanding and application of soil science.}},

Abstract = {{Intended as an overview aimed at potential users of remotely sensed
   spatial distributions and temporal variations of soil moisture, this
   paper begins with an introductory section on the fundamentals of radar
   imaging and associated attributes. To place the soil moisture sensing
   task in proper perspective, the prerequisite step of classifying terrain
   into four basic types-bare surfaces, short vegetation, tall vegetation,
   and urban-is addressed by demonstrating how a dual-frequency
   polarimetric radar can correctly classify terrain with an accuracy
   greater than 90\%. Over 5000 image pixels with known terrain identity
   were involved in the evaluation of the radar image classifier. For bare
   soil (with vegetation cover shorter than 15 cm), radar can estimate the
   volumetric moisture content (expressed in per cent) of the top 5 cm soil
   layer with an r.m.s. error of 3.5\%. Based on theoretical model
   predictions as well as experimental observations, strong evidence exists
   in support of radar's potential for sensing soil moisture under
   vegetation cover, but no operational algorithm exists at present.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave remote sensing at L-band (21 cm wavelength) can provide a
   direct measurement of the surface soil moisture for a range of cover
   conditions and within reasonable error bounds. Surface soil moisture
   observations are rare and, therefore, the use of these data in hydrology
   and other disciplines has not been fully explored or developed. Without
   satellite-based observing systems, the only way to collect these data in
   large-scale studies is with an aircraft platform. Recently, aircraft
   systems such as the push broom microwave radiometer (PBMR) and the
   electronically scanned thinned array radiometer (ESTAR) have been
   developed to facilitate such investigations. In addition, field
   experiments have attempted to collect the passive microwave data as part
   of an integrated set of hydrologic data. One of the most ambitious of
   these investigations was the Washita'92 experiment. Preliminary analysis
   of these data has shown that the microwave observations are indicative
   of deterministic spatial and temporal variations in the surface soil
   moisture. Users of these data should be aware of a number of issues
   related to using aircraft-based systems and practical approaches to
   applying soil moisture estimation algorithms to large data sets. This
   paper outlines the process of mapping surface soil moisture from an
   aircraft-based passive microwave radiometer system for the Washita'92
   experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave remote sensing provides a unique capability for direct
   observation of soil moisture. Remote measurements from space afford the
   possibility of obtaining frequent, global sampling of soil moisture over
   a large fraction of the Earth's land surface. Microwave measurements
   have the benefit of being largely unaffected by cloud cover and variable
   surface solar illumination, but accurate soil moisture estimates are
   limited to regions that have either bare soil or low to moderate amounts
   of vegetation cover. A particular advantage of passive microwave sensors
   is that in the absence of significant vegetation cover soil moisture is
   the dominant effect on the received signal. The spatial resolutions of
   passive microwave soil moisture sensors currently considered for space
   operation are in the range 10-20 km. The most useful frequency range for
   soil moisture sensing is 1-5 GHz. System design considerations include
   optimum choice of frequencies, polarizations, and scanning
   configurations, based on trade-offs between requirements for high
   vegetation penetration capability, freedom from electromagnetic
   interference, manageable antenna size and complexity, and the
   requirement that a sufficient number of information channels be
   available to correct for perturbing geophysical effects. This paper
   outlines the basic principles of the passive microwave technique for
   soil moisture sensing, and reviews briefly the status of current
   retrieval methods. Particularly promising are methods for optimally
   assimilating passive microwave data into hydrologic models. Further
   studies are needed to investigate the effects on microwave observations
   of within-footprint spatial heterogeneity of vegetation cover and
   subsurface soil characteristics, and to assess the limitations imposed
   by heterogeneity on the retrievability of large-scale soil moisture
   information from remote observations.}},

Abstract = {{Programs for the on-site measurement of soil moisture in the USA are
   reviewed. These are regional and national measurement programs that may
   be useful for the verification of remotely sensed soil moisture
   estimates and for hydroclimatic studies. Location and type of
   measurement are described. A technique for the utilization of on-site
   data of soil moisture and discharge together with remotely sensed data
   of the surface soil moisture is proposed for the estimation of soil
   water content aggregated over large areas. The technique is based on
   large-scale conceptual hydrologic models and on state estimation
   techniques that allow explicit account to be taken of measurement
   uncertainty. The proposed approach is explored in an example formulation
   applied to a 40 year record of monthly data from a 4672 km(2) natural
   catchment in Illinois. This study shows the ability of simple conceptual
   hydrologic models to simulate well both flow and soil water in humid
   areas and with monthly data. It is further shown that, even when the
   remotely sensed measurements of the surface soil moisture carry
   substantial measurement errors, inference of lower soil water and of
   total soil water is possible with an expected error that is smaller than
   that achieved without the use of the remotely sensed data.}},

Abstract = {{The return of water in vapor form from the land to the atmosphere, via
   plant transpiration and evaporation, is fundamental for the maintenance
   of the regional water cycle in the Amazon basin. Whereas transpiration,
   the dominant process, has the extensive vegetation cover as a large
   single source, evaporation can have several sources, and their relative
   importance and location are poorly known. The isotopic composition
   (delta(18)O and delta D) of water from various sources was used to see
   whether or not specific sources of water vapor to the atmosphere could
   be determined. It is well established that natural waters fall on a line
   called the meteoric water line (MWL; the regression of delta(18)O x
   delta D), With slope equal to eight and an intercept equal to ten. When
   a water body loses water via evaporation the slope become smaller than
   eight, typically 5-6. We estimated the slope of the regression of
   delta(18)O x delta D for several potential sources. We analyzed 1273
   samples: 500 of rainfall, 409 of river water, 134 of lake water, 164 of
   soil water, 40 of throughfall and stemflow water, and 26 of shallow
   ground-water. We found that large rivers and lakes are likely
   contributors of evaporated water to the atmosphere. However, as they
   cover only a small area of the basin, other sources are needed.
   Probably, evaporated water originates from several small sources that
   were not detected by the isotopic composition of our data.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major problems in understanding the hydrological cycle in
   high mountainous regions with much snow is evaluating the spatial and
   temporal distribution of precipitation. This study evaluates the water
   balance in two small neighbouring catchments, namely Honryu (HN) and
   Shozawa (SH) in the Takaragawa Forest Watershed Experiment Station,
   Japan, by analysing records of precipitation in rainfall seasons and
   snow water equivalent (SWE) in snowfall seasons. Because both records
   were satisfactorily correlated with the filtered elevation, the
   distributed values of precipitation and SWE for each grid point of the
   digital elevation map were evaluated based on this correlation in each
   of the seasons. Total precipitation during the snowfall seasons was
   estimated from the SWE records using a relation of the mean catchment
   SWE to the cumulative precipitation monitored continuously at the
   observation station. An annual water balance in the two catchments
   averaged over several years was calculated from the total mean catchment
   precipitation in rainfall and snowfall seasons. The catchment
   evapotranspiration derived from the water balance was compared with
   Hamon's potential evapotranspiration. Although a large difference
   between the two catchments in evapotranspiration was calculated from the
   water balance, several probable causes could be suggested for this
   difference, and it is concluded that the annual water balance could be
   estimated with an acceptable accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Lake Bosumtwi, lying in a million-year-old meteor crater, is
   hydrologically closed in spite of the wet, humid climate in this part of
   Ghana. To understand this geographical enigma, a water-balance model
   that describes both the historical lake-level record and the full range
   of lake levels observed in terrace deposits around the lake was
   developed. The water-balance model shows that the reception of rainfall
   by and evaporation from the lake surface are the dominant constituents
   of the water balance. Prior to 1969, the average rainfall of 1550 mm
   year(-1) was generally equal to lake evaporation, and the average annual
   rise of 30 cm year(-1) was produced mostly by runoff from the small
   watershed around the lake. Since 1969, with a decreased rainfall of 1380
   mm year(-1), the combination of rainfall and runoff has nearly equaled
   lake evaporation, resulting in a nearly steady lake level. Long-term
   simulations show that stochastic climatic variations very similar to
   those observed in this century could produce the full range of lake
   levels observed in terrace deposits. The low salinity of about 1 parts
   per thousand suggests that dissolved solutes were removed by lake
   overflow in the recent geological past.}},

Abstract = {{When tracers are introduced into an injection borehole, noticeable
   concentration gradients at the injection well may cause a backward
   spreading of the initial plume during radially convergent tracer tests.
   Based on this concept a non-rigorous mathematical model is developed to
   estimate the effect of backward spreading. The injection well with an
   instantaneous slug input is treated as a mathematical source and the
   initial plume at the injection well is allowed to move upstream. The
   model assumes that advection and longitudinal dispersion are the
   transport mechanisms in a radially converging how field. The Laplace
   transform solution for solute concentration in an infinite porous medium
   is obtained using the method of Green's function. Breakthrough curves
   are computed by numerically inverting the Laplace transform solution. As
   compared with the solution of Moench, it is concluded that the presence
   of backward movement of initial plume yields a decrease of peak
   concentration and spreading out of breakthrough curve tails. This effect
   is significant for small Peclet numbers and can be neglected for large
   Peclet numbers. A field tracer test is carried out to demonstrate the
   applicability of the model. The experimental data are fitted with the
   type curves of this study, and those of Moench's study, to determine
   dispersivity and aquifer porosity. The results show that dispersivity
   values estimated by matching the two type curves are different. Because
   it neglects backward dispersion, Moench's solution overestimates the
   dispersivity and effective aquifer porosity.}},

Abstract = {{An approach to estimating probable maximum precipitation (PMP) using a
   simple, totally objective, storm model of convective systems is
   outlined. PMP hyetographs are compared with observations for severe
   events, and the variation of storm model PMP with storm duration is
   compared with PMP values derived using the UK Flood Studies Report (FSR)
   (NERC, 1975, Department of the Environment, London) approach. The storm
   model generates PMP values very similar to the FSR for storm durations

Abstract = {{Sap flow rate was continuously measured in six trees of Laurus azorica
   at the experimental site of laurel forest in Agua Garcia mountains,
   Tenerife, Canary Islands, over 1 year from June 1993 to May 1994. Sample
   trees were of different sizes and covered the whole range of species. A
   sigmoid-like relationship based on basal area was applied to scale up
   the transpiration data from sample trees to the whole stand. Maximum
   transpiration for the stand was 7 mm day(-1). There was strong
   competition among the medium-sized trees in the high-density stand. The
   annual course of transpiration was very variable, owing to weather
   conditions, and was mainly controlled by the evaporative conditions.
   Contrasting with conditions in colder regions of the world with
   pronounced seasons, relatively high transpiration persisted over the
   mild winter. The annual total of transpiration was thus significantly
   higher, amounting to 636 mm year(-1) (about 500 mm from April to
   October). Nevertheless, the transpiration represented only a small
   portion of stand water balance (65\% of potential evaporation and 80\%
   of annual precipitation in the open).}},

Title = {{Evaluation and management of the impact of land use change on the
   nitrogen and phosphorus load delivered to surface waters: The export
   coefficient modelling approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{183}},

Abstract = {{A manageable, relatively inexpensive model was constructed to predict
   the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus from a complex catchment to its
   drainage system. The model used an export coefficient approach,
   calculating the total nitrogen (N) and total phosphorus (P) load
   delivered annually to a water body as the sum of the individual loads
   exported from each nutrient source in its catchment. The export
   coefficient modelling approach permits scaling up from plot-scale
   experiments to the catchment scale, allowing application of findings
   from field experimental studies at a suitable scale for catchment
   management. The catchment of the River Windrush, a tributary of the
   River Thames, UK, was selected as the initial study site. The Windrush
   model predicted nitrogen and phosphorus loading within 2\% of observed
   total nitrogen load and 0.5\% of observed total phosphorus load in 1989.
   The export coefficient modelling approach was then validated by
   application in a second research basin, the catchment of Slapton Ley,
   south Devon, which has markedly different catchment hydrology and land
   use. The Slapton model was calibrated within 2\% of observed total
   nitrogen load and 2.5\% of observed total phosphorus load in 1986. Both
   models proved sensitive to the impact of temporal changes in land use
   and management on water quality in both catchments, and were therefore
   used to evaluate the potential impact of proposed pollution control
   strategies on the nutrient loading delivered to the River Windrush and
   Slapton Ley.}},

Abstract = {{Most techniques used to analyse the flow of water to horizontal tile
   drains fail to separate the external boundary of the water table from
   the internal boundary of the tile drain. This is the first of a series
   of three papers which consider the correct formulation of the steady
   state and time-variant flow to tile drains. This paper is concerned with
   steady state conditions and provides important information about the
   correct formulation of tile drainage problems, especially the fact that
   the drain is an internal boundary. Field experiments are quoted which
   demonstrate the separation of the tile drains from the water table. A
   finite difference numerical solution to the full differential equation
   is developed with the drain represented as an internal boundary.
   Comparisons are made between conventional methods of analysis and the
   numerical solution; reference is also made to layered and anisotropic
   soils and surcharge pressures in the drains.}},

Abstract = {{This is the second of a series of three papers which consider the
   correct formulation of the steady state and time-variant flow to tile
   drains. The first paper is concerned with steady state conditions and
   provides important information about the correct formulation of tile
   drainage. This paper examines the complex problem of the time-variant
   flow conditions associated with tile drains operating under atmospheric
   pressures. A brief review of the literature which considers the
   available time-variant methods of design of tile drains is given. The
   correct formulation of two-dimensional time-variant flow, which
   represents the tile drain as an internal boundary conditions separate
   from the water table, is developed. A method of representing the
   time-variant water table on a finite difference mesh is presented and
   the methodology is demonstrated by a typical problem. Comparisons are
   made with the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USER) time-variant
   method of tile drain design.}},

Abstract = {{Global warming due to an increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in
   the atmosphere will affect temperature and rainfall, and hence river
   flows and water resources. This paper presents results from an
   investigation into potential changes in river flows in 21 catchments in
   Great Britain, using a daily rainfall-runoff model and both equilibrium
   and transient climate change scenarios. Annual runoff was simulated to
   increase by 2050 by over 20\% in the wettest scenarios and decline by
   over 20\% in the driest scenarios - and different catchments respond
   differently to the same change scenario. Monthly flows change by a
   greater percentage than annual hows, and under all the scenarios
   considered there would be a greater concentration of flow in winter.
   Snowfall, and hence snowmelt, would be almost entirely eliminated.
   Progressive changes in river flows over the next few decades would be
   small compared with year-to-year variability, but would be noticeable on
   a decade-to-decade basis.}},

   the flows converge towards the Wadi Tessaout downgradient following a
   large NE-SW drainage axis which represents a highly permeable zone. The
   water flow and the environmental isotopes show that the Turonian is
   supplied at the same time from both the outcrop of the `plateau des
   phosphates' to the north and the Atlas aquifers to the east. The
   drainage axis represents a mixing zone. Hydrometric monitoring of the
   springs of the Wadi Tessaout downgradient, and their hydrochemical and

Abstract = {{We present a synthesis on the meaning of the dissolved strontium
   concentration variations in groundwaters of the Cretaceous calcareous
   aquifer of the basin of Tadla in Morocco,which is some 10 000 km(2) in
   surface area. The geologic formations of Turonian age outcrop on the
   basin periphery only on the south-east boundary, which is overlapped by
   the High Atlas. They can be interbedded whith evaporite layers at the
   top or at the base. Some contaminants of the water are observed by the
   dissolution and by the mixing of sulphate waters with the carbonate
   aquifer waters. We demonstrate that the Sr2+/Ca2+ ratio is a way to
   differentiate the kind of reservoir and also the causes of
   hydrodynamical connections. Four geographic clusters have been
   recognized: a northern group which outcrops (0.8-1 parts per thousand),
   a confined aquifer (1.2-1.7 parts per thousand) where anhydride is
   associated with limestones, and two groups with sulphurous groundwaters
   (3-24 parts per thousand) separated into two parts; the first is in the
   northeast and is influenced by gypsiferous Cenomanian rocks (7-24 parts
   per thousand), and the second is in the south and is influenced by
   lagoonal Senonian sediments (top of the aquifer) and by Cenomanian
   deposits (base of the aquifer). We note a fifth distinct group (2.84

Volume = {{183}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{1-22}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Heterogeneity accounts for several paradoxes in groundwater flow and
   solute transport. One of the most striking observations is the emergence
   of scale effects in transmissivity, that is, the increase in effective
   transmissivity (or hydraulic conductivity, for that matter) with
   increasing scale of observation. Traditional stochastic approaches,
   where transmissivity is treated as a multilog-normal random function,
   lead to a large-scale effective transmissivity equal to the geometric
   average of local measurements.
   We present several field cases in which large-scale transmissivities are
   indeed larger than the geometric average of local tests. This suggests
   that the assumption of multilog-normality may not be valid in many
   cases, even if point T values display a log-normal distribution. We
   conjecture that scale dependence of T may, in part, be a consequence of
   high T zones being better connected than average or low T zones, a
   feature which may occur in many geological environments, but which is
   not consistent with multinormal log-T fields. We go on to generate a
   suite of log-T fields with a normal distribution for point values but
   non-multinormal spatial correlation, In all our fields, high T zones
   show longer correlations than average of low T zones. By simulating flow
   through these synthetic fields under simple boundary conditions, and
   estimating their effective transmissivity values, we conclude that these
   types of departures from the multilog-normality assumption lead
   consistently to scale effects.}},

Abstract = {{Currently available hardware and software for flow simulation can handle
   up to hundreds of thousands of blocks, or more comfortably tens of
   thousands of blocks. This limits the discretization of the reservoir
   model to an extremely coarse grid, say 200 x 200 x 25 for 10(6) blocks.
   Such a coarse grid cannot represent the structural and petrophysical
   variability at the resolution provided to geologists by well logs and
   outcrops. Thus there is no alternative to averaging the impact of all
   small-scale, within-block, heterogeneities into block `pseudos' or
   average values. The flow simulator will account for geological
   description only through those pseudos, hence detailed modelling of
   geological heterogeneity should not go beyond the information that block
   pseudos can carry, at least for flow simulation purposes. It is
   suggested that the present drive in outcrop sampling be clearly
   redirected at evaluating `geopseudos', i.e. at evaluating how
   small-scale variability (both structural and petrophysical) of typical
   depositional units averages out into large blocks' effective
   transmissivities and relative permeabilities. Outcrop data would allow
   the building of generic, high-resolution, numerical models of the
   gee-variability within a typical depositional unit: this is where
   geology intervenes. Then, this numerical model would be input into a
   generic flow simulator, single or multiphase, yielding genetic block
   averages, for blocks of various sizes and geometries: this is where the
   reservoir engineer intervenes. Next, the spatial statistics of these
   block averages (histograms, variograms,...) would be inferred: this is
   where the geostatistician intervenes. Last comes the problem of
   filling-in the actual reservoir volume with simulated block averages
   specific to each depositional unit. Because each reservoir is unique,
   random drawing of block average values from the previously inferred
   generic distributions would not be enough. The placement of block
   average values in the specific reservoir volume must be made conditional
   on local data whether well log, seismic or production-derived. This
   non-trivial task of `conditional simulation' of block average is the
   challenge of both the reservoir geologist and geostatistician. This
   paper proposes an avenue of approach that draws from the pioneering
   works of Steve Begg at BP-Alaska (1992, 1994) and Jaime Gomez-Hernandez
   at Universidad of Valencia (1990, 1991).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a solution of the flow problem in

   problem is posed in a stochastic framework, and our goal is to define an
   average flow equation and to derive the relationship between the mean
   gradient and the mean flux. For a stationary medium, such an approach
   would amount to the definition of the effective conductivity tensor, but
   in the present case, since due to the specific boundary condition the
   coefficient proportionality between the mean gradient and the mean flux
   depends on the angle between the trend and the mean gradient, we refer
   to it as the tensor of equivalent conductivity. We derive this tensor
   for one-, two- and three-dimensional flow equations.}},

Volume = {{183}},

Pages = {{69-99}},

Abstract = {{Hydrocarbon contaminants in the subsurface are important sources of
   pollution in aquifers. Hence, mathematical models of these flows have
   become key tools in environmental studies. In this paper we are
   interested in the flow in the saturated zone. Simulation of two-phase
   flow in large, complex heterogeneous domains often requires an
   unacceptably large number of computational grid blocks. Despite recent
   progress in computational methods and tools, we must call upon special
   techniques in order to use larger grid blocks while compensating for
   intracell variations in rock properties and fluid saturations. The use
   of pseudo-functions is one way of increasing grid dimensions to a more
   tractable level with a minimal loss of simulation representativeness.
   This change of scale problem has also been treated theoretically by
   different scaling-up techniques, such as large-scale averaging. This
   method calculates the transport equations and the effective properties
   at a given scale by an averaging process over the equations
   corresponding to a lower scale. This procedure leads to a closure
   problem which is very complex in the general case. Previously a first
   solution of the large-scale averaging problem was proposed in the
   quasi-static case corresponding to local capillary equilibrium. In the
   general case of a heterogeneous medium with a complex geometry, this
   boundary value problem (closure problem) can be solved by numerical
   methods. For this purpose, after having chosen a grid-block description
   of our system in accordance with the description used in reservoir
   simulators, we have implemented a three-dimensional (3-D) numerical
   resolution of the closure problem. The most important variations in the
   rock properties are associated with the permeability. We have therefore
   generated porous media with a random permeability distribution using
   different methods. Other multiphase properties are chosen to depend on
   the permeability. The properties of the closure problem in the case of
   randomly generated porous media are investigated. In particular, we give
   the conditions under which the general form of the local capillary
   pressure and relative permeability curves are recovered at the large
   scale. Particular properties related to each generation method are
   stated. The equivalent properties are calculated using averages over the
   results of many realizations of a given medium. The influence of the
   size of the averaging surface for a given correlation length as a
   function of the variance of the permeability is studied. We have
   therefore established some general rules for the calculation of the
   large-scale properties of random porous media.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines whether practical and useful effective parameters
   can be developed and used in the complex case of multiphase flow in
   heterogeneous porous formations. Strong non-linearities in the governing
   how equations make exact evaluation of effective parameters difficult,
   and several shortcomings in the published work to date are identified.
   In particular, an important multiphase flow phenomenon, fingering, has
   yet to be properly treated. This may be a severe limitation because, as
   demonstrated in two-dimensional laboratory experiments, the presence of
   heterogeneities will provide conditions suitable for the generation of
   fingers. The development of fingers introduces a new length scale into
   the hierarchy of heterogeneity scales exhibited by natural porous
   formations, the finger diameter. Experimentally, it is observed that
   finger development allows fluid to by-pass a significant fraction of the
   porous media, increasing the front velocity and reducing the degree of
   large-scale entrapment. As explicit consideration of fingering has yet
   to be included in the evaluation of effective parameters for multiphase
   how, including unsaturated how, such phenomena may not be accurately
   represented in the approaches developed thus far. The experimental
   observations suggest that when the scale of an oil plume is much larger
   than the heterogeneity length scale then a large-scale flow model based
   on the local flow equations should describe the overall flow, even in
   the presence of local fingering. Nevertheless, the challenging problem
   of deriving the appropriate effective properties remains.}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the effects of reactive transport processes
   within a heterogeneous porous aquifer, two small-scale forced gradient
   tracer tests were conducted at the `Horkheimer Insel' field site. During
   the experiments, two fluorescent tracers were injected simultaneously in
   the same fully penetrating groundwater monitoring well, located
   approximately 10 m from the pumping well. Fluoresceine and Rhodamine WT
   were used to represent the classes of practically non-sorbing and
   sorbing solutes, respectively. Multilevel breakthrough curves with a
   temporal resolution of 1 min were measured for both tracers at different
   depths within the pumping well using fibre-optic fluorimeters. This
   paper presents the tracer test design, the fibre-optic fluorimetry
   instrumentation, the experimental results and the interpretation of the
   measured multilevel breakthrough curves in terms of temporal moments and
   effective transport parameters. Significant sorption of Rhodamine WT is
   apparent from the effective retardation factors. Furthermore, an
   enhanced tailing of Rhodamine WT breakthrough curves is observed, which
   is possibly caused by a variability of aquifer sorption properties. The
   determined effective parameters are spatially variable, suggesting that
   a complex numerical how and transport modelling approach within a
   stochastic framework will be needed to adequately describe the transport
   behaviour observed in the two experiments. Therefore, the tracer test
   results will serve in future work for the validation of numerical
   stochastic transport simulations taking into account the spatial
   variability of hydraulic conductivity and sorption-related aquifer
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{Concern about the environmental effects of agricultural chemicals
   through preferential flow has risen in recent years. A simple model is
   presented describing the processes involved in preferential transport of
   both soil-adsorbed and non-adsorbed solutes. The model assumes that
   water and solutes are mixed into an upper soil layer. The water and
   solutes then flow through macropores to the groundwater. Analysis of the
   solute breakthrough curves in subsurface drainage effluent makes it
   possible to calculate the depth of the mixing layer or the adsorption
   desorption partition coefficient. Data from a drainage experiment with
   chloride, 2.4-D and atrazine were used to test the model. The study was
   performed on a no-till and a conventionally tilled plot. The model and
   experimental results indicate that only a fraction of the field area
   participates in transport to the macropores. Differences between
   breakthrough curves from the conventionally tilled and no-till plots are
   explained well by the mixing of solutes and water in the upper layer.
   This simple, physically based model can help us to understand and
   estimate the environmental threats of herbicides shortly after
   application.}},

Abstract = {{In order to be able to extrapolate reactive pollutant transport
   behaviour from the laboratory experiment in the aquifer field scale it
   is necessary to combine the deterministic laboratory results with the
   stochastics of the held situation to produce effective macroscopic

   to arrive at effective retardation and dispersion parameters. Effective
   time-scales for chemical reactions such as adsorption and degradation
   may no longer be determined by the time-scales of processes on the
   molecular scale only but also by rate-limiting steps arising from the
   variable accessibility of reactive parts of the medium. For a bacterial

Abstract = {{An efficient cosimulator is developed for generating both random
   hydraulic property fields and related flow regimes under either
   saturated or unsaturated conditions. This cosimulator combines a
   spectral random field generator, based on the Fast Fourier Transform
   technique, and first-order perturbation/spectral solutions for flow in
   saturated and unsaturated porous media, Owing to the first-order
   approximation of the simulator, flow regimes in several geological media
   with different variabilities are simulated to investigate the accuracy
   of the simulator. For mild and moderately heterogeneous geological
   media, the simulator is found to be very accurate in terms of pressure
   head field and flux distributions. In addition, the execution time of
   the simulator is substantially smaller than that of any classical
   numerical simulator. However, the accuracy of the simulator deteriorates
   as the geological medium becomes highly heterogeneous.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic conductivity upscaling is a process that transforms a grid of
   hydraulic conductivities defined at the scale of the measurements, into
   a coarser grid of block conductivity tensors amenable for input to a
   numerical flow simulator. The need for upscaling stems from the
   disparity between the scales at which measurements are taken and the
   scale at which aquifers are discretized for the numerical solution of
   flow and transport. The techniques for upscaling range from the simple
   averaging of the heterogeneous values within the block to sophisticated
   inversions, after the solution of the flow equation at the measurement
   scale within an area embedding the block being upscaled. All techniques
   have their own advantages and limitations. Recently, the definition of
   the geometry of the grid has been intimately linked to the upscaling
   problem; promising results have been obtained using elastic gridding.
   Also, recently, the need to perform Monte-Carlo analysis, involving many
   realizations of hydraulic conductivity, has steered the development of
   methods that generate directly the block conductivities in accordance
   with the rules of upscaling, yet conditional to the measurement data.}},

Abstract = {{Sampling of springs, for which the mean elevation of recharge could be
   estimated, provided an estimate of -0.44 parts per thousand 100 m(-1)
   for the groundwater altitude effect on the delta(18)O value in Eastern
   Macedonia and -0.2 parts per thousand in Thrace. A slight difference in
   both the slope and the intercept of the lines expressing the regression
   of elevation against delta(18)O values in the continental part of Thrace
   and the island of Thassos, is also observed.
   As case studies, the isotopic composition of surface water and
   groundwater was used to investigate the mechanism of recharge of
   groundwater in the areas of Lekani Mountains and Thassos Island. As a
   result, the contribution of water leaking from the river Nestos to the
   recharge of the springs of Paradissos, near to the river bed, Kastro
   Filippon and Aghios Athanassios, at a distance of over 25 km from the
   river bed, as well as of the aquifers tapped by boreholes in the plain
   between Kastro Filippon and Aghios Athanassios, was indicated. The
   estimate is 54 +/- 12\% for the contribution of the river water to the
   spring yield, in the case of Aghios Athanassios, and 43 +/- 10\% in the
   case of the springs of Paradissos.
   As another result, the hydraulic connection between the marbles of
   Profitis Ilias and the marbles and dolomites of Potamia series, in the
   case of Thassos Island, was confirmed.
   Finally, the extent of the carbonate rocks and the amount of
   precipitation effective in recharge to the main springs, as well as to
   the aquifers tapped by boreholes in the different plains of the areas
   under investigation were estimated.}},

Abstract = {{The recovery of clean water from dew has remained a longstanding
   challenge in many places all around the world. It is currently believed
   that the ancient Greeks succeeded in recovering atmospheric water vapour
   on a scale large enough to supply water to the city of Theodosia
   (presently Feodosia, Crimea, Ukraine). Several attempts were made in the
   early 20th century to build artificial dew-catching constructions which
   were subsequently abandoned because of their low yield, The idea of dew
   collection is revised in the light of recent investigations of the basic
   physical phenomena involved in the formation of dew. A model for
   calculating condensation rates on real dew condensers is proposed. Some
   suggestions for the `ideal' condenser are formulated.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of trace element concentrations in the major rivers
   discharging into the Humber estuary, NE England, show a broad separation
   between the southern rivers draining urban and industrial areas and
   northern rivers draining predominantly rural, mineralised catchments. An
   evaluation of the dissolved and acid available particulate phases has
   been made. The results show that the trace elements can be classified
   into two groups: (1) elements with a significant acid available
   particulate component (Al, As, Ba, Cr, Co, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn, Ni and Zn)
   and (2) elements predominantly in dissolved form (B, Li, Mo, Rb, Sc and
   Sr). The relationships between concentrations and flow are used to
   evaluate sources of trace elements. In the rural, mineralised northern
   catchments, concentrations of dissolved Al and most transition metals
   show a positive relationship with flow, indicating diffuse sources
   derived from nearsurface runoff. Concentrations of dissolved B, Ba, Li,
   Sc and Sr show a negative relationship with flow and appear to be
   derived from groundwater sources. Within the southern rivers draining
   urban and industrial catchments, most elements in the dissolved phase
   exhibit negative relationships with how, indicating that point-source
   discharges provide the major source of trace elements to the rivers. The
   exceptions to this relationship are Al and Ba, which exhibit a positive
   relationship with flow, indicating predominantly diffuse near-surface
   sources of these elements. For the acid available particulate fraction,
   concentrations increase with increasing flow as would be anticipated
   owing to the increase in suspended load at high flow. The trace element
   concentrations in the rivers draining the southern industrial urban
   catchments, although significantly higher than background levels, are
   low compared with other major industrial rivers of Europe (e.g. the
   Rhine), with the exception of iron and manganese, and meet UK
   Environmental Quality Standards for dissolved trace elements set for
   sensitive fish species, such as salmonids.}},

Abstract = {{Evaporation from bare soil surfaces represents an important water loss
   for agriculture in semi-arid regions, Numerous efforts have been
   undertaken to modify the topsoil characteristics (mulching, tillage) in
   order to create a thin dry topsoil that reduces evaporation. However,
   little attention was paid to the role of natural rock fragments in
   topsoils with respect to evaporation. This paper presents the results of
   laboratory experiments simulating evaporation from initially wet and
   air-dry soils containing a range of rock fragment contents, and compares
   them to field conditions, Evaporation was stimulated by blowing fans at
   one (high) evaporative demand (E(o) = 7.7-9.2 mm day(-1)). Time domain
   reflectometry (TDR) was used to investigate the relation between the
   water content of the topsoil and the actual evaporation rate. For soils
   at field capacity, initial fine earth water content decreases with rock
   fragment content, and consequently evaporation rates decrease in the
   same order. For air-dry soils that received a limited amount of rain (10
   and 20 mm), an opposite behaviour was observed. Initial fine earth water
   content and evaporation rates increase with rock fragment content. A
   strong positive sigmoidal relation between relative evaporation rate
   (actual over open-pan evaporation rates) and fine earth water content in
   the centre of the wetted soil section was observed during the laboratory
   experiments. Except for the columns covered with a mulch, there were no
   systematic differences in this relation between the treatments, A rock
   fragment mulch reduces evaporation rate at a given soil water content
   significantly, These trends explain the often ambivalent effects of rock
   fragments on evaporation rates in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Year round, concentrations of base cations (Ca, Mg, Na, and K) and Cl-
   in surface and groundwater decline exponentially away from Interstate

   between base cations and H+ at individual sites suggest that cation
   exchange reactions between peat and water achieve a state of
   equilibrium. These ratios change systematically with increasing distance
   from the highway, indicating systematic changes in the character of the
   peat exchange surfaces. The major change is a decrease in the occupancy
   of exchange sites by Na away from the road. These relationships and
   inferred processes have been duplicated with laboratory experiments.
   Base saturation of the peat, dominated by Ca, decreases with distance
   from the highway. Thus, in the short term, peat-water equilibration
   exerts strong controls on the water chemistry, particularly ion ratios.
   Long term exposure to elevated concentrations of Ca, Mg, and NaCl in the
   shallow ground waters has altered the peat chemistry. Availability of
   plant nutrients (Ca, Mg, and K) has been generally increased by the
   weathering of road-bed fill and equilibration of the NaCl salt with the
   peat.}},

Abstract = {{The river Kali in western Uttar Pradesh (India) has been heavily
   influenced by the discharge of untreated municipal, agricultural, and
   industrial effluents. In the main channel of the river, the metal
   contamination was found to be three to four times the background level.
   The concentration of iron, zinc, and copper was 0.41, 0.04, and 0.015 mg
   l(-1), respectively, in the upstream section during October. The same
   were 0.56, 0.07, and 0.016 mg l(-1), during December.
   Comparisons between upstream and downstream monitoring sites reveal
   changes in the concentration and/or load to the river and can be used to
   discriminate between point and non-point sources of pollution for these
   elements in the river. The resulting differential loadings, if adjusted
   for uncharacterized non-point contribution to the load, may represent
   the total point source load to the river minus any losses due to
   volatilization, settling, and/or degradation. Mass balance calculations
   conducted for iron, zinc, and copper indicated that additional inputs
   are needed to account for the observed differences in load along the
   river. The sources may include non-point sources of pollution due to
   agricultural activities, sediment remobilization or entrainment,
   groundwater intrusion or from a combination of these sources. The
   difference may also be attributed to some point sources of pollution
   which could not be identified in the course of investigations.}},

Abstract = {{The direct evaluation of water resources of non-monitored basins using
   hydrological transposition methods is one of the present-day challenges
   for hydrologists. Therefore, an ambitious research program concerning
   the hydrology of a small watershed has been developed over the last 30
   years by SUDENE and ORSTOM in Sertao, northeastern Brazil. In this way,
   data related to hydrological mechanisms were collected from 43 small
   watersheds scattered throughout an area of 1 000 000 km(2) where the
   weakness and the irregularity of the water resources have caused several
   dramatic droughts. In a first step, two main pluviometric areas were
   identified. Inside each of them, and for each kind of watershed, a
   simple relation between rainfall and runoff annual means was adjusted.
   The 43 monitored basins were then grouped by using two different
   typologies, the first one relative to their hydrological regime, and the
   second to their physical characteristics. The hydrological regime's
   typology was established by using two simple indicators: L(600), the
   average annual runoff corresponding to a 600 mm precipitation amount,
   and X(10), the flood volume per 10 years. It is shown that the factor
   L(600) is intrinsically related to the regularity of the hydrological
   regimes and that the basins situated on sedimentary sub-soils exhibit
   the lower flood rate X(10). This first typology is then compared with
   the second one, on the basis of the watershed's physical
   characteristics. This comparison corroborates the consistency of the two
   typologies by the fact that the original clustering of basins is found
   again. As a result, soil and vegetation turn out to be the predominant
   factors. These results were then used to work out a simple water
   resource evaluation method which can be used for small watersheds where
   hydrological local information is lacking. This transposition method
   requires maps of annual isohyets, soils and a global estimation of three
   correction factors for anomalies of vegetation cover and the existence
   of small dams or any area that may retain runoff.}},

Abstract = {{SAMP (subsystems and moving packets) is a new type of model for
   simulating non-steady movement of water in unsaturated porous media
   under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, and the associated
   movement of a non-sorbing solute. It can be used in many types of
   simulations, including: solving Richards' equation; advection and
   dispersion of solute in a medium containing dead-space; preferential
   water and solute movement in a medium containing macropores and
   determining the fate of `new' and `old' water and solute when the new
   enters a region containing the old. The model is approximate in that the
   modelled region is divided into cells, and discrete packets of water
   (which may contain solute) are moved within and between these cells, and
   stochastic in that each move is determined by probability calculations
   and the use of random numbers. The pore space within each cell is
   divided into 100 or more distinct independent thermodynamic subsystems,
   and the internal moisture state of a cell is described by a binary
   number: bit i of this number is 1 when subsystem i is saturated (i.e.
   contains a packet) and 0 when it is dry. The basic parameters of the
   model are those for the matric potential and unsaturated hydraulic
   conductivity (equilibrium) functions, as used with Richards' equation.
   Property data for each subsystem are derived from the equilibrium
   functions and these data are assumed to apply even under non-equilibrium
   conditions. The only further parameter is the internal scale, X. The

Abstract = {{The theory for SAMP is developed in Ewen (1996. J. Hydrol., 182:
   175-194). SAMP (subsystems and moving packets) is a new type of model
   for simulating non-steady movement of water in unsaturated porous media
   under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, and the associated
   movement of a non-sorbing solute. It can be used in many types of
   simulations, including: solving Richards' equation; advection and
   dispersion of solute in a medium containing dead-space; preferential
   water and solute movement in a medium containing macropores; and
   determining the fate of `new' and `old' water and solute when the new
   enters a region containing the old. The design of a model (SAMP1) for
   the 1-dimensional movement of water and solute is described and results
   presented for the simulation of a laboratory solute breakthrough
   experiment and percolation through aggregated soil in the unsaturated
   zone. The parameters for the model are those for the matric potential
   and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions, as used with Richards'
   equation, plus a new parameter, lambda, the internal scale. The
   simulation results demonstrate the role of lambda in controlling the
   efficiency with which old water is displaced by new water, and the
   degree to which there is non-equilibrium movement.}},

Abstract = {{For several years Environment Canada (EC) has carried out a program of
   water sampling at four stations along the Fraser River and at one
   station on each of its two principal tributaries, the Thompson and the
   Nechako. Samples collected at bi-weekly intervals have been analyzed by
   EC for major and some trace components. Seasonal variation in water
   composition mainly relates to changes in discharge, this being low
   during winter and high during early summer snowmelt. Dissolved
   constituents, Mg, Si, K, Ca, Sr, HCO3, SO4 and (NO3+NO2), show moderate
   variation, being least concentrated during maximum discharge, reflecting
   dilution of groundwater by melting snow. Factor analysis shows secondary
   seasonal variation for SO4, that is related to the importance of deep
   groundwater as a source, and for (NO3+NO2), precipitated with snow and
   released during snowmelt. Large amounts of Na and Cl are added in pulp
   mill effluent. A uniform flux of this effluent, superimposed on a highly
   variable river discharge, gives rise to greater seasonal variation for
   Na and Cl than other dissolved constituents. The trace constituents, Fe,
   Mn, Al, P and Sr, were analyzed by EC in unfiltered water samples by
   methods that extract the elements from suspended material. Except for
   Sr, these elements have a high partition factor in favor of suspended
   over dissolved phases; their results reflect seasonal changes in
   quantities of suspended material, which can vary by two orders of
   magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a stochastic analysis of the Nash cascade of
   identical reservoirs in which the storage coefficient is treated as a
   random variable. Based on the theory of stochastic differential
   equations, a new stochastic expression for the instantaneous unit
   hydrograph is obtained and recommended as an alternative to the existing
   equation. It is found that the sample function of the proposed
   stochastic instantaneous unit hydrograph takes the same form as the
   corresponding deterministic solution (Nash's equation). Moments of the
   proposed stochastic instantaneous unit hydrograph are derived. An
   application to a watershed has shown that the proposed stochastic
   instantaneous unit hydrograph can preserve the statistical properties of
   the observed data. The effect of the random coefficient on the
   stochastic instantaneous unit hydrograph is also discussed.}},

   methods of analysis are used in the study: the Grassberger-Procaccia
   algorithm and the method proposed by Scargle. Neither indicated any
   evidence of chaotic behavior in these tree ring series. The series are
   also successfully modeled by a second-order stationary stochastic

Abstract = {{Much hydrological data can be displayed as two-way tables with
   observations classified (for example) by years (rows) and sites
   (columns), commonly with many missing entries; data classified by three
   factors or more (e.g. gauge sites within drainage basins; drainage
   basins; years) can also be put in this form. On an appropriate scale,
   the observations in such tables can frequently be represented by linear,
   additive models of components, some of which can be considered as random
   variables. Residual maximum likelihood (REML) is a technique for fitting
   models in which each observation is expressed additively in terms of
   fixed and random effects. When the model contains only one such random
   effect, the linear model reduces to a restricted form of multiple
   regression; REML can be regarded as an extension of multiple regression
   to the case where there are several error terms with different
   statistical characteristics. Models of this kind are appropriate in the
   hydrological context where the effects of the-years (or other periods)
   of observation can be regarded as a sample from a hypothetical
   population of years (periods), or where sites can be regarded as random.
   The paper discusses two examples where REML was used: one in estimating
   mean areal monthly rainfall in Amazonia, using incomplete records from
   48 raingauge sites, and the other using incomplete records of annual
   floods from 19 gauging stations on the Rio Itajai-Acu, in southern
   Brazil. In both cases, the assumptions of the REML model were satisfied
   and the objectives of the analysis achieved. Given the prevalence of
   incomplete hydrological records, the REML method may well have wider
   application.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the applicability of the endmember mixing analysis
   (EMMA) to agricultural catchments. The basic assumptions of the method
   are discussed in the case of semi-natural and rural ecosystems. EMMA was
   applied to two storm events in a farmland catchment in Brittany (France)
   using four endmembers and three tracers. The results were validated
   using additional tracers. The sensitivity of the method to uncertainty
   in the endmember composition was analysed using a Monte-Carlo procedure.
   The results were satisfactory although the method is very sensitive when
   the endmember composition is close to the streamwater chemistry. It is
   concluded that mixing analysis is a valuable tool for studying water
   pathways in agricultural areas, provided it is applied over short
   periods and used with other hydrological approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of hydrologic models requires that appropriate data
   be selected for model calibration. In the research presented here, the
   shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA) global optimization method was used
   to calibrate the NWSRFS-SMA conceptual rainfall-runoff flood forecasting
   model of the US National Weather Service, using a 40-year record of
   historical data. Based on 344 calibration runs using different lengths
   of data from different sections of the historical record, we conclude
   that approximately 8 years of data are required to obtain calibrations
   that are relatively insensitive to the period selected. Further, the
   reduction in parameter uncertainty is maximal when the wettest data
   periods on record are used. A residual analysis is used to compare the
   performance of the daily root mean square (DRMS) and heteroscedastic
   maximum likelihood error (HMLE) objective functions. The results suggest
   that the factor currently limiting model performance is the
   unavailability of strategies that explicitly account for model error
   during calibration.}},

   after the cessation of rainfall the discharges are mainly controlled by

Abstract = {{The Third, Middle and Reedy Lakes system in northern Victoria is a
   series of interconnected lakes in which groundwater discharge and
   recharge occur under seasonal climatic and artificial influences. At
   high lake levels there is a pronounced mounding effect which tends to
   cause localised perturbation of flow systems and recharge into the
   uppermost aquifer. Three hydrostratigraphic units (referred to as
   `Lower','Middle' and `Upper') are identified beneath the lakes. An
   upward hydraulic gradient exists in the region under the present
   hydrologic regime. Despite this, hydrochemical and isotopic evidence has
   demonstrated a fresh water lens beneath Reedy Lake in the Middle and
   Lower aquifers. These waters have similar characteristics to the
   present-day water table which is being recharged from the lakes,
   suggesting that the lens represents lake-water recharge under a prior
   hydrologic regime when regional water tables were lower. The recognition
   of this lens has important implications for future management strategies
   in that it may be possible to implement a more natural wetting-drying
   cycle without the intrusion of saline water into this ecologically
   sensitive area.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the wandering braided channel pattern and its
   formative mechanism, with the middle Hanjiang River as an example. The
   middle Hanjiang River is characterized by a multi-braided, shallow and
   wide channel with a number of unstable midchannel bars and a frequently
   shifting thalweg. However, before the construction of the Danjiangkou
   Reservoir it basically exhibited an equilibrium of sediment transport.
   The formation of the wandering braided channel pattern of the Middle
   Hanjiang River is not caused by strong sedimentation as in the lower
   Yellow River, but is controlled by strong erosion of the river bank.
   Large quantities of sediment are supplied to the channel by bank
   erosion; after exchange with the sediment carried from the upstream, the
   sediment from bank erosion is deposited in mid-channel bars. While some
   new mid-channel bars are formed, some old ones become attached to the
   bank. In this way, a wandering braided channel pattern with many
   unstable midchannel bars can develop under a condition of sediment
   transport equilibrium. Mineral analysis indicates that the material from
   bank erosion constitutes a major material source for mid-channel bars
   building. Based on a plot of channel width against bankfull discharge, a
   discriminant relation has been established to distinguish between
   wandering braided and the non-wandering channel patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Runoff and soil loss data were collected for four rainfall seasons from
   six natural runoff plots situated on a 6\% uniform slope area in the low
   rainfall zone of northern Iraq. There were three plots 30 m long and
   three plots 10 m long. Rainfall at the site was found to be highly
   variable. Individual storms were classified as severe and normal storms.
   Severe storms are the least frequent but account for the bulk of
   seasonal runoff and soil loss. Runoff ratio significantly decreased in
   dry seasons. Seasonal soil loss was generally low due mainly to the
   gentle land slope and the dominantly low intensity rain. Runoff and soil
   loss from single storm events were simulated using the concepts of
   stream power and the conservation of mass and energy. Observed and
   simulated runoff and soil loss agreed reasonably well. Observed runoff
   and soil loss records were also used to test the validity of the
   USDA-Soil Conservation Service (SCS) curve number method and the
   universal soil loss equation in the region. It was concluded that these
   two prediction methods need modification to suit rainfall and soil loss
   patterns in the region. Runoff and soil loss prediction on a single
   storm basis is emphasized.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater and surface water interaction in two conifer swamps located
   in headwater catchments with contrasting till depth, typical of the
   southern Canadian Shield, were studied from June 1990 to August 1992,
   Both swamps had little influence on the regulation or attenuation of
   seasonal runoff response in the catchment. The two valley bottom swamps
   were connected to local aquifers but the upland-wetland connection was
   continuous in the catchment with deeper till and ephemeral in the
   catchment with thin till-rock ridges. Groundwater movement through the
   wetlands was restricted mainly to the surface peat layer in both
   wetlands, because a large portion of inputs from shallow soil layers and
   stream inflows enter near the peat surface. However, differences in
   upland-wetland connections resulted in contrasting hydrologic regimes in
   the two swamps. During seasons with larger inputs, both swamps were
   hydrologically connected to uplands and had a similar hydrology
   characterized by a high water table, rapid storm response, and
   predominance of saturated overland flow, In summer, upland inputs were
   absent in the catchment with thin till-rock ridges, resulting in
   cessation of baseflow and a lower water table that varied in response to
   variations in rainfall. Continuous upland inputs throughout the summer
   in the catchment with deeper tills (1-3 m) sustained baseflow and kept
   the water table near the peat surface. This study demonstrates the
   control of morphology and shallow subsurface geology on the hydrology of
   valley bottom swamps influenced by local aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this project is to determine which data collection
   techniques are best suited for quantifying and delineating spatial
   variations in surface infiltration and for estimating infiltration
   parameters used in computer models for simulation of runoff quantity
   following summer rainstorm events from a small watershed (Incline Creek
   watershed, Nevada) in the Lake Tahoe Basin. Field tests which give the
   infiltration parameters of sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity, two
   parameters found in the Philip infiltration model, were performed in the
   watershed using a disk permeameter. These field data were combined with
   coverages in an existing Geographical Information System (GIS) database
   and held observations of surface attributes (soil type and vegetation)
   which are known to contribute to variation in infiltration rates.
   Statistical tests performed on the field-test data indicate that the
   only surface attribute which influences variations in infiltration rates
   in this watershed (owing mainly to limited variations in soil type) is
   vegetation. Further, time-to-pending calculations which indicate when
   and if runoff might occur following the start of a precipitation event
   indicate that for most precipitation events likely to occur in this area
   during the summer, infiltration in all but nonforested areas is
   unlikely. The coverages in the GIS database were used to develop a map
   of the watershed which delineates areas of low potential infiltration
   from areas of high potential infiltration which can be used in parameter
   estimation and watershed conceptualization in computer modeling of
   runoff.}},

Abstract = {{High spatial variability in snowmelt phenomena was observed in the
   experimental watershed of the upper Cordevole (7 km(2)), in the
   Dolomites. Snowmelt depends, at a point scale, on available energy,
   which in turn is heavily affected by slope, aspect and shading effects
   of the site. A distributed hourly model of snowmelt was set up as a
   geographical information system (GIS) module. The model accumulates
   snowfall for each raster element (20 m x 20 m) using a temperature
   threshold. It simulates snowmelt using air temperature and a radiation
   index consisting of daily average values of clear sky radiation that
   have cumulated at selected dates since 21 December. It should be
   underlined that the only relevant calibration parameter of the model is
   the combined snowmelt factor, which is unique for the whole basin. The
   clear sky radiation maps were computed for a selected period of the
   year, based on the watershed digital terrain model and the solar path
   sampled at very short intervals. When run for a season, the model
   produces snow water equivalent maps at given dates. The model was
   validated, with satisfactory results, by comparing these maps with 60
   snow covered area surveys and related water equivalent measures
   collected in six snowmelt seasons from 1986 to 1991. The classical
   temperature index approach to snowmelt modelling does not allow the full
   variability over the basin to be taken into account. Besides, it seems
   important to point out that this fully distributed approach allows us to
   avoid the use of snow covered area (SCA) depletion curves, the
   definition of which still proves a troublesome task.}},

Abstract = {{The Dupuit-Forchheimer, the fully saturated flow, and the variably
   saturated flow models, are compared for problems involving steady-state,
   unconfined how through porous media. The variably saturated flow model
   is the most comprehensive of the three and requires more parameters. The
   performances of the three models are compared for different soil
   properties, problem dimensions, and how geometries. There are certain
   types of problems where the simpler models may yield satisfactory
   results. For soils with large pores and/or broad pore-size-density
   functions, the variably saturated how model solutions to steady-state
   problems approach those of the fully saturated flow model, owing to the
   manner in which the soil-water retention curve and relative permeability
   function, respectively, affect the variably saturated flow model
   solutions. For problems of significant size, the fully saturated how
   model may be sufficient, as the effects of the vadose zone are
   relatively diminished. For problems with radial symmetry (e.g. steady
   flow to a well), the fully saturated flow model performs well because
   the variably saturated flow model is relatively insensitive to the
   parameters describing the soil properties, as the amount of vadose zone
   how, compared with the total flow, is relatively insignificant in such
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents results of a 5 year study to characterize the
   hydrology (rainfall, interception, evapotranspiration (ET), soil water
   storage, drainage rate, lateral seepage, and water table fluctuations)
   of three identical drained, pine-forested watersheds in Carteret County,
   North Carolina. During the 2 year calibration period (1988-1989), all
   three watersheds were operated in conventional drainage mode with the
   weirs in the outlet ditch approximately 1.0 m below the soil surface.
   About 17\% of the total rainfall was intercepted and subsequently
   evaporated and 53\% was removed by transpiration and evaporation from
   the soil during this period. Drainage removed about 28\% and the
   remaining 3\% was lost by lateral seepage. During the 3 year controlled
   drainage treatment period (1990-1993), drainage in Watershed 2, managed
   for tree growth, was reduced to 21\% of gross rainfall as compared with
   30.5\% for Watershed 1 under free drainage. Watershed 3, managed to
   minimize offsite impacts, yielded 26\% of gross rainfall as drainage.
   Interception loss accounted for about 14.5\% of the gross rainfall. ET
   amounts computed as the residual in a water balance, were 50\%, 60\%,
   and 55\% of total rainfall for Watersheds 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The
   effects of controlled drainage on water table depths, drainage and ET
   were demonstrated for seasonal and year-to-year variation in rainfall.
   The controlled drainage treatments affected both drainage volumes and
   daily peak outflow rates. The treatment in Watershed 3 was more
   effective in reducing peak outflow rates.}},

Abstract = {{In models for one-dimensional unsaturated flow in layered soils based on
   the general flow equation, non-linear coefficient functions appear. The
   inverse problem consists of the identification of parameters in models
   for these coefficients. In this study, parameters are identified for
   layered soils. The general flow equation is solved iteratively,
   adjusting the values of the parameters until the solution matches a set
   of in situ water content data. The optimization method is based on a
   quasi-Newton method with Richardson extrapolation. Data sets of
   different size and with various degrees of perturbation are used to
   investigate existence, uniqueness and accuracy of parameter estimates.
   To stabilize parameter estimates, a weighting procedure is proposed
   based on the values of the water content data. The correspondence of
   parameter estimates, based on relatively small sets of unperturbed data,
   to the true parameter values indicates a high degree of numerical
   accuracy of the method. Parameter estimates based on perturbed data sets
   suggest that ill-posedness of the estimation problem is a matter of data
   insufficiency and modeling errors, rather than of data error alone.}},

Volume = {{181}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{251-283}},

Abstract = {{Geochemical and isotopic parameters are used to evaluate models for the
   evolution of saline groundwaters in the Edwards aquifer, which lies on
   the northwestern margin of the Gulf of Mexico sedimentary basin. Saline
   groundwaters, termed `badwaters', rang in salinity from 1000 to 12 500
   mg l(-1) total dissolved solids. Models for badwater evolution must
   account for complexities owing to: (1) the range in compositions of
   saline basinal fluids that may migrate into the Edwards aquifer from its
   down-dip section and from underlying hydrostratigraphic units; (2) the
   range of depositional, diagenetic, and mineralogic variations in the
   host aquifer rocks; (3) volcanic and intrusive igneous rocks that
   locally crosscut the aquifer; (4) extensive faulting, which in places
   juxtaposes Edwards aquifer units with adjacent hydrostratigraphic units.
   Calcium, Mg, Na, SO4, Cl, and HCO3 variations define six badwater
   hydrochemical facies. Strontium isotope values of freshwaters
   (Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.7077-0.7086), badwaters (0.7076-0.7094), and brines
   from aquifer rocks down-dip (0.7078-0.7097) are nearly all higher than
   the range of most Edwards aquifer rocks (0.7074-0.7077) and volcanic and
   intrusive igneous rocks that crosscut the aquifer (0.7032-0.7055).
   Argillaceous carbonate rocks that underlie the Edwards aquifer are
   likely sources of Sr with high Sr-87/Sr-86 values.
   Transitions between the hydrochemical facies in some locations
   correspond to changes in depositional environments in aquifer rocks and
   to changes in the intensity of faulting through the aquifer. Major
   element, mineral saturation state, and Sr/Ca-Sr-87/Sr-86 variations in
   badwaters of the westernmost aquifer region indicate that incongruent
   dissolution of gypsum and recrystallization of calcite control the
   geochemical evolution of these badwaters. Sr/Ca-Na-Cl-Sr-87/Sr-86
   variations in badwaters of extensively faulted areas to the east of the
   westernmost aquifer region are consistent with fluid mixing processes
   involving at least five endmember fluids, including (1) saline
   groundwaters from two underlying hydrostratigraphic units, (2) two
   endmember brines from down-dip Edwards aquifer equivalent units, and (3)
   freshwaters that have interacted extensively with aquifer rocks. The
   compositions of badwaters from the north-easternmost region reflect
   fluid mixing between freshwaters and saline groundwaters from underlying
   hydrostratigraphic units.}},

Abstract = {{Pore-water samples were collected in the Albany River drainage basin of
   the Hudson Bay Lowland. The chemistry of these samples was evaluated
   using bivariate plots, cluster analysis, and principal component
   analysis to determine the importance of groundwater and to evaluate
   geochemical processes within the peat. The transport of dissolved
   constituents from the mineral soil into the peat column is a dominant
   control on peat pore-water chemistry. Peatland landforms have different
   signatures for pore-water chemistry; bogs are characterized by elevated
   concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, CH4, SiO2, K+ and larger
   mineral ion balance errors, whereas fens are characterized by their
   higher pH and alkalinity. Large mineral ion balance errors (up to 99\%),
   the inverse relationship between pH and dissolved organic carbon, and
   the positive correlation between mineral ion balance error and dissolved
   organic carbon show that organic acids are important anions in bog pore
   waters. Methane concentrations and SO42- concentration are inversely
   related, suggesting that SO42- inhibits CH4 production. Feat pore water
   at several locations contains high concentrations of marine salts
   (SO42-, Cl-, and Na+) in the lower half of the peat column, indicating
   that the marine sediments contain sea salts. We suggest that SO42- from
   these marine sediments may reduce methane production in portions of the
   Hudson Bay Lowland.}},

Abstract = {{Canopy water storage amounts were measured with a newly developed
   measuring system based on the attenuation of a 10.26 GHz microwave
   signal. Every 5 min, vertical scans were made, over a period of 9
   months. A physically based multi-layer interception model with empirical
   parameters was calibrated using a non-linear optimization technique. The
   calibrated model appeared to be capable of explaining up to 92\% of the
   measured variance of water storage amounts for an independent validation
   period when using on-site measurements of meteorological variables. The
   performance decreased only slightly to 89\% when other input sets were
   used for this period. These were necessary to extrapolate the results to
   longer time series required for evaluating canopy resistances in the
   study of deposition of airborne pollutants (Vermetten et al., Proc. 5th
   IPSASEP Conf., Vol. 3, 1992). The resemblance between measured
   throughfall amounts and simulated results and the plausibility of the
   model parameters, although they were optimized without setting any
   limits, enhances confidence in the model results.}},

Abstract = {{A physically based distributed rainfall-runoff model is applied to the
   basin of the River Ouse, North Yorkshire, with a catchment area of 3315
   km(2). The model includes a description of overland flow, subsurface
   flow, vertical water transfer in the soil, evapotranspiration, and
   channel flow in the river network. The finite-element schematization of
   the catchment provides a representation of the drainage network and the
   spatial pattern of topography, soils, and meteorological inputs. Most of
   the parameters of the model are determined on the basis of the
   topography and measured soil characteristics. Other parameters are
   calibrated using 15 min rainfall and flow data for six flood events and
   daily rainfall and runoff data for 1986. Temporal disaggregation based
   on the average variability method of Pilgrim et al. (Civ. Eng. Trans.
   Inst. Eng. Aust., CE11: 9-14, 1969) is used to generate hourly estimates
   of rainfall from daily measurements. Model simulations are compared with
   daily flow measurements for the years 1987-1990. Results show that the
   model can simulate catchment outflows satisfactorily while giving
   hydrologically meaningful estimates of internal variables.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the flow modelling of the Aspo site (Sweden)
   performed with a finite element code, ROCKFLOW, which is able to take
   into account the how in the porous matrix and in the 22 large fracture
   zones individualized in the conceptual model. The use of various
   computing tools-3D automatic mesh generator, various efficient solvers,
   and automatic calibration program-is described. ROCKFLOW is a 3D finite
   element code, originally developed at Hanover University Institut fur
   Stromungsmechanik (IFS), designed to simulate flow and transport in a
   permeable rock mass intersected by some fracture zones of relatively
   high conductivity (dual porosity model). The mesh generator, which had
   never been used on such a complicated geometry, gave satisfactory
   results (especially when the mesh was improved by introducing refinement
   planes), and so did the various ROCKFLOW modules we used. Because of too
   many uncertainties in hydrodynamic parameters (storage coefficient of
   porous matrix and fractures, matrix conductivity, water salinity
   variation with depth) and in geometric parameters (lateral extension of
   fractures, model boundaries) a precise model calibration of all model
   parameters could not be attempted. Instead, we concentrated on testing
   the feasibility of an accurate representation of the Aspo site with its
   22 individualized fractures. In that respect, the results in both
   natural steady and transient state for simulation of the LPT2 pumping
   test were satisfactory. We recovered the natural piezometric state and
   drawdown evolutions with a good accuracy and brought to light the
   importance of several parameters such as matrix conductivity, water
   salinity variation with depth and infiltration rate: An automatic
   calibration of hydrodynamic parameters, using Newton's method to
   minimize an error criterion, gave proof of the steady how model
   consistency. This automatic calibration, which was also carried out for

   understand the model sensitivity to several hydrodynamic parameters such
   as storage coefficient of the matrix blocks and transmissivities for
   deep fractures, and reinforces confidence in the accuracy of the model.}},

Abstract = {{Research relating to soil leaching properties under turfgrass conditions
   has often been conducted on disturbed soils where macropore structure
   has been destroyed. The objective of this study was to compare the
   solute movement characteristics of undisturbed and disturbed soil
   columns covered with turfgrass. Dispersivities and chloride (Cl)
   breakthrough curves of undisturbed and disturbed soils were
   investigated. Soil columns were excavated into three sections after
   testing, for which the mean bulk density was 1.33 Mg m(-3) for the
   undisturbed columns and 1.16 Mg m(-3) for the disturbed columns. The
   dispersivity for the undisturbed columns was over three times greater
   than for the disturbed columns. Chloride concentration found in Layer 1
   (0-6.7 cm), Layer 2 (6.7-13.4 cm), and Layer 3 (13.4-20.0 cm) were 2.8,
   5.3, and 4.8 times higher, respectively, for the disturbed soils than
   for the undisturbed. Applying conclusions from solute movement studies
   using repacked columns covered with turfgrass to actual undisturbed
   field conditions could lead to errors in interpretation because of the
   effect of macropores.}},

Abstract = {{Across equatorial Africa, increasing demand for groundwater has raised
   concerns about resource sustainability and has highlighted the need for
   reliable estimates of groundwater recharge. Recharge investigations in
   this environment are typically inhibited by a shortage of good quality
   meteorological and hydrogeological records. Moreover, when recharge
   studies are attempted they tend to rely on a single technique and
   frequently lack corroborating evidence to substantiate recharge
   predictions. In recent studies undertaken in the Aroca catchment of the
   Victoria Nile basin in central Uganda, the timing and magnitude of
   recharge determined by a soil moisture balance approach are supported by
   stable isotope data and groundwater flow modelling. The soil moisture
   balance study reveals that recharge averages in the order of 200 mm
   year(-1) and is more dependent on the number of heavy (more than 10 mm
   day(-1)) rainfall events than the total annual volume of rainfall.
   Stable isotope data suggest independently that recharge occurs during
   the heaviest rains of the monsoons, and further establish that recharge
   stems entirely from the direct infiltration of rainfall, an assumption
   implicit in the soil moisture balance approach. Deforestation over the
   last 30 years is shown to have more than doubled the recharge estimate.
   Aquifer flow modelling supports the recharge estimates but demonstrates
   that the vast majority (over 99\%) of recharging waters must be
   transmitted by the aquifer in the regolith rather the underlying bedrock
   fractures which have traditionally been developed for rural water
   supplies.}},

Abstract = {{The Kidd Creek Cu-Zn sulphide mine is located near Timmins, Ontario.
   Mill tailings are thickened and deposited as a thickened slurry in a
   circular, conical-shaped pile with an area of approximately 1200 ha.
   Deposition of tailings as a thickened slurry results in a relatively
   uniform grain-size distribution and hydraulic conductivity, and a thick
   tension-saturated zone above the water table. The tailings are drained
   by numerous small, ephemeral stream channels, which have developed in a
   radial pattern. During storms, water from these streams collects in
   catchment ponds where it is held before treatment. The contribution of
   tailings pore water to the run off is of interest because of the
   potential for discharge of pore water containing high concentrations of
   Fe(II)-acidity, metals and SO4 to the stream. Hydraulic head
   measurements, measurements of water-table elevation and groundwater how
   modelling were conducted to determine the mechanisms responsible for
   tailings pore water entering the surface streams. Chemical hydrograph
   separation of storm run off in one of these streams, during three
   rainfall events, using Na and Cl as conservative tracers, indicates that
   the integrated tailings pore water fraction makes up between less than
   1\% and 20\% of the total hydrograph. This range is less than the
   maximum fraction of tailings pore water of 22-65\% reported for run off
   from a conventional tailings deposit. At this site, preferential flow
   through permeable fractures may be the dominant mechanism causing
   discharge of tailings pore water to storm run off. Estimates of the mass
   of Fe(II) that discharges to the surface run off from the pore water
   range up to 2800 mg s(-1) during a moderate intensity, long duration
   rainfall event. The greatest potential for discharge of significant
   masses of solutes derived from the pore water exists during long
   duration rainfall events, when the water table rises to the surface over
   large areas of the tailings impoundment.}},

Abstract = {{In eastern England the Chalk aquifer is covered by extensive Pleistocene
   deposits which influence the hydraulic conditions and hydrochemical
   nature of the underlying aquifer. In this study, the results of
   geophysical borehole logging of groundwater temperature and electrical
   conductivity and depth sampling for major ion concentrations and stable
   isotope compositions (delta(18)O and delta(2)H) are interpreted to
   reveal the extent and nature of the effective Chalk aquifer of north
   Norfolk. It is found that the Chalk aquifer can be divided into an upper
   region of fresh groundwater, with a Cl concentration of typically less
   than 100 mg l(-1), and a lower region of increasingly saline water. The
   transition between the two regions is approximately 50 m below
   sea-level, and results in an effective aquifer thickness of 50-60 m in
   the west of the area, but less than 25 m where the Eocene London Clay
   boundary is met in the east of the area. Hydrochemical variations in the
   effective aquifer are related to different hydraulic conditions
   developed in the Chalk. Where the Chalk is confined by low-permeability
   Chalky Boulder Clay, isotopically depleted groundwater (delta(18)O less
   than -7.5 parts per thousand) is present, in contrast to those areas of
   unconfined Chalk where glacial deposits are thin or absent (delta(18)O
   about -7.0 parts per thousand). The isotopically depleted groundwater is
   evidence for groundwater recharge during the late Pleistocene under
   conditions when mean surface air temperatures are estimated to have been
   4.5 degrees C cooler than at the present day, and suggests long
   groundwater residence times in the confined aquifer. Elevated molar
   Mg:Ca ratios of more than 0.2 resulting from progressive rock-water
   interaction in the cofined aquifer also indicate long residence times. A
   conceptual hydrochemical model for the present situation proposes that
   isotopically depleted groundwater, occupying areas where confined
   groundwater dates from the late Pleistocene, is being slowly modified by
   both diffusion and downward infiltration of modem meteoric water and
   diffusive mixing from below with an old saline water body.}},

Abstract = {{A six parameter stochastic point process model, known as the modified
   Bartlett-Lewis Rectangular Pulses Model, is applied to fairly long
   hourly rainfall data recorded at Valentia (relatively a wet location)
   and Shannon Airport (relatively a dry location), Ireland. Five different
   sets of statistics of the rainfall data of each month, assuming local
   stationarity within the month, are used to estimate the parameters and
   to simulate model output. The problems of parameter
   stability/sensitivity and identification are discussed and it has been
   shown that the sensitivity of the model parameters to the choice of six
   statistics can be avoided by estimating the six parameters by
   optimization from 16 statistics namely mean, variance, lag-1
   autocorrelation coefficient and proportion dry of hourly, 6-hourly,
   12-hourly, and 24-hourly rainfalls. Some useful properties of the
   rainfall depth process are analysed using the notion of event-based
   statistics. The conditional distributions of rainfall depth and maximum
   intensity, mean event profiles, and various other features of the
   rainfall depth process obtained from the model simulated samples compare
   favourably with the historical ones.}},

Abstract = {{A binary homovalent ion exchange transport model governed by local
   chemical equilibrium is considered for a one-dimensional, steady flow in
   a homogeneous soil column. An analytical solution of the aqueous
   concentration distribution for the convex exchange is obtained by
   applying nonlinear shock wave theory. The main nonlinear feature is the
   breaking of fronts into shock waves. The corresponding mathematical
   theory is the method of characteristics with a special treatment of
   shock waves. The wave velocity and front thickness are also obtained to
   illustrate the front propagation and structure. The derivation of the
   solution presented may offer a wide range of application opportunities
   and may also provide a good approach for solving the binary heterovalent
   exchange transport model.}},

Abstract = {{Regional behaviour of the groundwater flow system in the Cochabamba
   Valley, Bolivia, is evaluated through the interpretation of tritium
   (H-3) distributions in groundwater samples from wells and springs. In
   order to interpret groundwater H-3 concentrations in Cochabamba Valley,
   where no historical record of H-3 concentrations in rainfall exists, a
   reconstructed H-3 precipitation record is developed. The record of H-3
   concentrations in precipitation is fairly extensive in the Amazon Basin
   and this record was extrapolated to the neighbouring Cochabamba Valley,
   Tritium concentrations in rainfall have been observed to increase under
   natural conditions with increasing latitude and with increasing distance
   from the ocean. By considering these trends, a linear relationship for
   increasing H-3 concentration in precipitation is developed, based on
   data from the Amazon Basin, that realistically predicts regional H-3
   distributions from the northeast Brazilian coast to Cuzco, Peru. This
   H-3 precipitation record is then extrapolated to the Cochabamba Valley
   and, after correction for radiogenic decay, is used to interpret trends
   in groundwater H-3 concentrations within the valley.
   The groundwater flow system in one of the principal alluvial fans, which
   serves as an important groundwater resource for the city, is studied in
   detail. Tritium concentrations drop from approximately 8-10 tritium
   units (TU) in the recharge area to concentrations below the detection
   limit of 0.8 TU further out in the valley. Groundwater velocities of
   approximately 0.3 to 0.9 m d(-1) are estimated from distributions of
   groundwater H-3 concentrations along the alluvial fan with the use of
   the reconstructed precipitation H-3 record. Regional characteristics of
   the groundwater flow system are discussed with respect to future
   development and protection of the groundwater resources.}},

Abstract = {{Several papers have recently used the tendency for the evaporative
   fraction (the ratio of latent heat flux to available energy, denoted EF)
   to be nearly constant during the daytime, in other words, the
   conservation of EF, to estimate daytime evaporation given only one or
   two estimates of EF during the middle of the day. However, the physical
   basis for this conservation, and the conditions under which it might be
   expected to occur, have not been systematically investigated. To do
   this, data from the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE) are used, along
   with other observations from the literature and some simple modeling. It
   is concluded that a complicated combination of weather conditions, soil
   moisture, topography, and biophysical conditions contribute to the
   variability or conservation of EF on individual days. However, two
   important factors in determining the amount of variability of EF on a
   given day are related to cloudiness and the advection of moisture and
   temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Analytic solutions play an important role in the testing of models
   evaluated by numerical methods. This paper presents a straight forward
   method for determining analytic solutions to multiple species
   contaminant transport problems in porous media. The method uses Fourier
   sine transforms (as opposed to Laplace transforms) to obtain the
   solution of Cho (1970, Can. J. Soil, Sci., 51: 339-350) in a simpler
   way. It provides a flexible approach to the introduction of new boundary
   and initial conditions within the model. New solutions are presented for
   constant and exponential initial contaminant profiles.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main purposes of a water balance study is to evaluate the net
   available water resources, both on the surface and in the subsurface.
   Water balance models that simulate hydrographs of river flow on the
   basis of available meteorological data would lie a valuable tool in the
   hands of the planners and designers of water resources systems. In this
   paper, a set of simple monthly snow and water balance models has been
   developed and applied to regional water balance studies in the NOPEX
   area. The models require as input monthly areal precipitation, monthly
   long-term average potential evapotranspiration and monthly mean air
   temperature. The model outputs are monthly river flow and other water
   balance components, such as actual evapotranspiration, slow and fast
   components of river flow, snow accumulation and melting. The results
   suggest that the proposed model structure is suitable for water balance
   study purposes in seasonally snow-covered catchments located in the
   region.}},

Abstract = {{A hydrological reconnaissance study in a first-order tropical rainforest
   catchment in western Amazonia implicated overland flow as an important
   hydrological pathway. A complementary hydrometric and hydrochemical
   approach that involved the recording of overland flow hydrographs and
   the determination of streamflow, overland flow, groundwater, soil water,
   and throughfall chemical signatures, was essential to establish
   unambiguously the importance of this pathway. Largely uncontrolled by
   topography, overland flow does occur in any season, regardless of
   antecedent moisture conditions, which only influence the volumes
   generated. The latter effect is also reflected in a close approximation
   of stormflow and overland flow chemical signatures, as expressed in the
   K/SiO2 ratio. We conclude that, despite its greater logistical demands,
   a complementary hydrometric/hydrochemical approach is essential to
   understand a catchment's hydrological behaviour, especially where fast
   pathways are at work; such pathways are apparently common in more forest
   ecosystems than has been previously assumed.}},

Abstract = {{To examine nitrate persistence, detailed geochemical profiling, using
   core-squeezed water and piezometer samples, was carried out at five
   sites in southern Ontario where groundwater is moving downward in
   silt-rich aquitard sediments at rates of 16 to more than 20 cm year(-1).
   Elevated levels of NO3--N (5-50 mg l(-1)) that occur in the shallow
   groundwater as a result of agricultural activity, were found to be
   consistently attenuated, generally to very low levels (< 0.05 mg
   l(-1)-N), at the `redoxcline', the horizon marking the boundary between
   the surficial weathered (brown) sediments and the underlying unweathered
   (grey) sediments. Tritium dating suggests that groundwater at the
   redoxcline depths (3-5 m) was recharged between 1970 and 1980, thus the
   NO3- depletion appears to result from biodegradation reactions since no
   major landuse changes have occurred during this period. The dose
   association of the nitrate depletion zones with the redoxcline, where,
   in particular, sediment sulphur contents increase abruptly, and where
   also porewater SO42- levels increase, suggests that the dominant
   attenuation reaction is autotrophic denitrification using reduced
   sulphur compounds present in the unweathered sediment as the electron
   donor. Mass balance calculations suggest that the increase in the
   downward rate of migration of the redoxcline, owing to added sulphur
   consumption from NO3- contamination, is only about 1 mm year(-1) at
   these sites. Review of the literature indicates that most silt- and
   clay-rich sediments have S contents in the same range, or higher, than
   those investigated here, thus, in most cases where aquifers are overlain
   by several metres or more of unweathered confining sediments, it is
   likely that a high degree of protection is afforded from surficial NO3-
   contamination.}},

Abstract = {{Methods of measuring interception capacity of the understorey (grasses)
   and litter layer have been developed to estimate the forest floor
   interception capacity of a 15-year-old Pinus radiata plantation and a
   native dry sclerophyll eucalypt forest at Lidsdale State Forest,
   Australia.
   In this study, interception by various types of forest floor have been
   measured in the laboratory using a technique of applying artificial rain
   to undisturbed samples of the forest door. These laboratory experiments
   separately measure the interception storage capacity of the pine needle
   mat, the leaf/twig/bark debris mat in the eucalypt forest, and of the
   understorey (grasses). The results indicate that the interception
   storage capacity of all components of the forest door of both vegetation
   types were proportional to the mass per unit area of forest floor cover.
   It was also shown that the interception storage capacity of the pine
   needle mat and the leaf/twig/bark debris mat under eucalypt were
   proportional to the thickness of the surface debris. For standing
   grasses the capacity was proportional to the percentage of ground cover.
   These laboratory results were then used to estimate the forest floor
   interception storage capacity of two experimental catchments each
   covered by one of the two forest types.
   In each case the forest floor was extremely heterogeneous, and so a
   large number of undisturbed samples were examined. Approximate forest
   floor interception capacity of the pine catchment was 2.8 mm and of
   eucalypt was 1.7 mm. The contribution of leaf litter, stem and branch
   litter, and grass vegetation to the overall interception capacity was
   similar for both catchments at 47\%, 8\% and 45\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved Ba, Cd, Co, Mn, Mo, Ni, Rb, Sb, Sr, U and V were measured in
   the Oubangui river (Central African Republic) during a complete flood
   period. The dissolved concentrations vary by factors ranging from 1.4 to
   8.2 as a function of river discharge: Sr, Ba, Rb and Mo concentrations
   decrease with rising stage; Ni, U, Sb, Cd, V and Mn concentrations
   increase with rising stage. These distributions are explained by a
   mixing of quick flow, mostly surface runoff with delayed flow, mostly
   groundwater. The dual origin of stream waters is demonstrated by the
   major element ratios, which are close to a silicate end-member during
   the high-flow period and trend towards a carbonate end-member during the
   low-flow period. Moreover, geological heterogeneities in the Oubangui
   basin may play a role in the variation of concentrations observed at the
   basin outlet. The previously indicated presence of a subsurface
   carbonate sequence in the lower part of the basin is confirmed. Cd, V,
   Mn and Co show peak concentrations during decreasing stage. We suggest
   that biological processes such as release from phytoplanktonic material
   and dissolution of oxides or carbonate phases may explain this maximum.}},

Abstract = {{In the first part of this paper, the impact of forestry, agriculture and
   urban activities on the quality of surface water is analysed. Daily data
   from 15 forest and agricultural experimental catchments of the Institute
   of Hydrology, Slovak Academy of Sciences are used. It is shown, that the
   nitrate concentrations in surface water have decreased in Slovakia since
   1989 as a result of decreased use of inorganic nitrogen fertilisers
   (lower intensity of agricultural production in Slovakia owing to recent
   economic changes). The annual nitrate specific load varies from 5.90 to
   110 kg ha(-1) year(-1), the annual sulphate load varied from 29.16 to
   509.60 kg ha(-1) year(-1) and the annual phosphate load varied from
   0.0098 to 0.0224 kg ha(-1) year(-1) during 1990-1992.
   In the second part, a two-step method of three-component hydrograph
   separation of rain-, soil- and groundwater is proposed. The method is
   used in the Manelo-Gribov microbasin (0.95 km(2)) in Eastern Slovakia.
   The annual contribution of surface runoff in total runoff volume was
   57.5\%, the contribution of interflow runoff was 21.1\%, and the
   contribution of groundwater was 21.4\%, during the period from 1 August
   to 31 July 1992. A deterministic regression model for predicting daily
   nitrate concentrations from values of-stream daily discharge and flow
   component data was developed. A set of 1421 modelled NO3- data was
   compared with the set of measured data.}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with continuous-state reservoirs in discrete time, in
   terms of the (continuous) Moran transform U-t = Z(t) + X(t) of the
   (discontinuous) storage levels Z(t). In the non-seasonal case, if the
   inflows X,have a first-order Markov structure, the modified storage
   levels U, have a second-order Markov structure. It is shown that, for
   each value of u, the limit p(u,v) as t --> infinity of the joint density
   p(t+1) (u,v) of U-t+1 at u and U-t at v satisfies a certain non-standard
   first-order linear integral equation of the form
   p(u, v) = (0) integral(infinity) a(u, v, w)p(v, z)dz
   or, equivalently, a standard second-order equation of the form
   p(u, v) = (0) integral(0)(infinity) integral(infinity) a(u, v, z)a(v, z
   w)p(z, w)dzdw
   In the seasonal case, with two seasons, the corresponding bivariate
   density p(u, v) for consecutive seasons satisfies a second-order
   integral equation of the form
   p(u, v) = (0) integral(0)(infinity) integral(infinity) A(u, v, w, z)p(z,

Abstract = {{Land-surface processes are part of the lower boundary conditions for the

   represent this forcing are relatively simple but they play an important
   role in the simulation of climate. This paper compares three different

   atmospheric conditions in order to analyse the differences in the
   hydrological cycle. The intercomparison showed that simulated
   evaporation, runoff and soil moisture were different in all three cases,
   In order to get a better understanding of the mechanisms at work in the
   models, features from two of the schemes were included in the other
   scheme, With these modifications we were able to reduce the wide range
   between model results. We showed that the surface resistance and field
   capacity were essential parameters in determining the annual cycle of
   evaporation and that a representation of subgrid-scale variability of
   soil moisture had an important impact on runoff.}},

Abstract = {{We present a general lumped parameter mathematical model for hydrologic
   tracer data interpretation and mean transit time calculation in
   hydrologic systems. The model takes the form of the three-parameter
   gamma distribution and accounts for different mixing types: perfect
   mixing; no mixing (piston flow); partial mixing (dispersive mixing, or
   the type between perfect mixing and no mixing); and various combinations
   of the above types. In these combinations, the different mixing types
   simulated by the model conceptually represent reservoirs in series. We
   introduce the mixing efficiency to characterize the extent or degree of
   natural mixing in hydrologic systems. This parameter equals zero for
   piston flow (no mixing), unity for perfect mixing, and a value in
   between these two extremes for partial mixing. The general model
   simulates the combination of perfect mixing, partial mixing, and piston
   flow. Six other models that simulate one or two of these mixing types
   can be obtained as special cases from the general model. Therefore,
   seven models are introduced in this effort. Of these, four (including
   the general model) are new, and three are currently existing in the held
   of tracer hydrology. The three existing models are the perfect mixing
   model, piston flow model, and the perfect-piston flow model which
   simulates the combination of perfect mixing and piston flow. The new
   models are the perfect-partial-piston flow model (the general model),
   perfect-partial mixing model, partial-piston flow model, and partial
   mixing model.
   Modeled mean transit times for three case studies agree with previous
   estimates: 21 and 2.4 years for two springs (sites 2 and 45,
   respectively) on Cheju Island, Republic of Korea; and 3.0 years for the
   Ottawa River basin, Canada.}},

Abstract = {{Two procedures to estimate the area-averaged snowmelt and meltwater
   outflow from a snowpack were compared for a river basin in the south

   rate at the surface of the snowpack, the degree-day method and the
   Kuzmin method. For averaging, the spatial change in the meteorological
   inputs and the statistical distribution of the premelting snow water
   equivalent before melt are taken into account. The calculated
   basin-averaged meltwater outflow is checked against the snowmelt input
   obtained from the measured runoff hydrograph by solving the inverse
   problem for a runoff generation model. It also gives opportunities to
   calibrate the basin-averaged degree-day factor, coefficients of the heat
   component dependences, or dependences for parameters of spatial
   statistical distribution of snow characteristics. The procedure based on

Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Open ditch drainage has been observed to have a significant effect on
   catchment runoff regimes, yet the processes generating the changes are
   not well understood. An approach of physically based modelling is used,
   with a fine grid resolution, on a very simple hill-slope model to
   analyse how ditches affect runoff. Results from the simulations show
   that the most important process is the change in behaviour of the
   sub-surface, under near-saturated conditions, when there is a much
   higher and more variable sub-surface exchange flow into the stream
   network. The speed of the surface runoff response is also affected. From
   the results of the analysis a method using effective parameterisation
   has been developed to recreate the effects of the drainage in a coarser
   resolution catchment model. The method involves calculating effective
   saturated hydraulic conductivities for the sub-surface flows and
   effective Strickler coefficients for the surface flows. The application
   of the method is demonstrated for a sub-catchment of the River South
   Tyne at Alston. Results from these simulations show that predictions of
   flow for the catchment can be improved by using the effective
   parameterisation to create a pseudo drainage representation of the
   sub-grid-scale channels within the model. Simulations of more intensive
   drainage scenarios show that the effects of open ditch drainage on
   hydrology are significant and that the direction of change is not
   intuitive.}},

Abstract = {{A complete sequence of daily rainfall (bulk precipitation) samples
   collected between January 1980 and April 1981 at Wallingford, in central
   Southern England, together with a few month's samples from other sites
   in west Wales, northern England and southern Scotland, have been
   analysed for iodate and total iodine concentration. The wet deposition
   of iodine depended mainly upon the amount of rainfall, and the average
   monthly total iodine concentration was not found to vary seasonally as
   had been anticipated. This behaviour contrasted markedly with that of
   chloride and sodium ions, whose average monthly concentration decreased
   during summertime. On average, iodate composed one-half of the total
   iodine. The iodine chemistry of the rainfall is discussed in terms of
   the equilibrium between HOI and I-2, and between iodine and other redox
   systems, e.g. peroxide and ozone.}},

Abstract = {{The underground water flows in volcanic rocks of a continental seismic
   area (Armenia) are analysed using three approaches: (1) the structure of
   the basaltic reservoir; (2) the features of the hydrogeological domains
   involved and their structural limits; (3) the hydraulic behaviour of the
   system, deduced from spring outflows, measured every 3 days for 4 years.
   According to these data, and without piezometric data, it is possible to
   compute the circulations in the basaltic reservoirs according to the
   diffusivity equation, The results of this computing exercise are
   compared with the measured values. The good fit obtained between
   computed and measured values suggests that this model could be used in
   similar cases.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes the use of an integrated surface-subsurface
   modelling approach to estimate recharge to a semi-arid Karoo aquifer and
   a comparison of the results with a chloride mass balance on a sub-area
   scale. Parameters were not calibrated, to test the success with which
   the model can be applied in regions of scarce data. The chloride balance
   suggests a mean annual recharge of 4.5 mm year(-1) based on a mean
   annual rainfall of 460 mm. The model predicts 5.8 mm year(-1) from a
   mean annual rainfall of 483 mm during the simulation period. Recharge
   was found to be highly variable in space with a positively skewed
   distribution in time. Spatial variability was attributed to differences
   in the distribution of soil moisture content resulting from variations
   in slope, soil texture and depth. Both methods suggest that recharge is
   considerably less than the mean of 9.9 mm year(-1) estimated from the
   currently prescribed rainfall-recharge relationship for Karoo aquifers.}},

   models developed by hydrologists and land-surface parameterisation
   schemes developed for incorporation into atmospheric general circulation
   models (AGCMs) are explored. The simulations indicate that the key
   surface water and energy quantities estimated by a typical
   rainfall-runoff model (MODHYDROLOG) and a typical land-surface scheme
   (BEST) for a wet tropical catchment and a temperate ephemeral catchment
   are reasonably similar. The results suggest that the parameterisations
   used in land-surface schemes can simulate runoff satisfactorily for wet
   areas but are too simplified to model runoff adequately in ephemeral
   catchments. The simulations also suggest that the simple algorithms used
   in rainfall-runoff models can be adopted for climate change impact
   studies and for use with AGCMs.}},

Abstract = {{Two modifications of the approximate analysis of interface motion during
   two-fluid density-driven flows of De Josselin de Jong (Proc. Euromech.,
   143: 75-82, 1981) are applied to the slumping of finite two-dimensional
   and axisymmetric brine mounds. Both lead to simple similarity solutions.
   One modification gives upper bounds on the time-scales of the process
   and the other lower bounds. The bounds are close enough to allow
   estimation of true behaviour within order-of-magnitude accuracy.
   Application of the solutions to brine-fresh interactions is illustrated
   by a numerical example based on natural salinas. The analysis applies to
   any pollutant or pollution solution denser than the groundwater, and it
   carries over to the converse problem of the spreading over the
   groundwater of a lighter pollutant (such as petroleum).}},

Abstract = {{The present study involves transport experiments in a three-dimensional,
   heterogeneous porous medium, Latex particles and chloride are utilized
   as tracers in an artificially constructed porous medium consisting of a
   heterogeneous mixture of glass beads. Data collected include chloride
   breakthrough, particle breakthrough, and particle concentrations
   remaining within the medium (determined through destructive sampling at
   the end of the experiment). The chloride breakthrough curve showed
   substantial dispersion, an indication of mixing among a number of
   different flow lines (the mixing occurred in the outflow reservoir). The
   outflow counts of latex particles showed that particles were
   successfully transported across the length of the medium. The
   destructive samples showed a complex distribution of particles remaining
   within the medium which was correlated with the structure of the medium,
   particularly with the high-permeability pathways, Comparison of the
   results from this experiment with results from previously published
   results from two-dimensional media demonstrate that the successful
   transport of particles across the medium is a direct result of
   connectivity of high-permeability paths in the third dimension. This
   observation is consistent both with the distribution of trapped
   particles and with numerical analysis of the flow field.}},

Abstract = {{Predictions of two popular closed-form models for unsaturated hydraulic
   conductivity (K) are compared with in situ measurements made in a sandy
   loam field soil. Whereas the Van Genuchten model estimates were very
   close to field measured values, the Brooks-Corey model predictions were
   higher by about one order of magnitude in the wetter range. Estimation
   of parameters of the Van Genuchten soil moisture characteristic (SMC)
   equation, however, involves the use of non-linear regression techniques.
   The Brooks-Corey SMC equation has the advantage of being amenable to
   application of linear regression techniques for estimation of its
   parameters from retention data. A conversion technique, whereby known
   Brooks-Corey model parameters may be converted into Van Genuchten model
   parameters, is formulated. The proposed conversion algorithm may be used
   to obtain the parameters of the preferred Van Genuchten model from in
   situ retention data, without the use of non-linear regression
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The more than 1550 km(2) (600 mi(2)) Hat Creek Basin in northeastern
   California is host to several first magnitude cold springs that emanate
   from Quaternary basaltic rocks with individual discharge rates ranging
   from 1.7 to 8.5 m(3) s(-1) (60-300 ft(3) s(-1)). Stable isotope
   (delta(18)O, delta D, delta(13)C) and C-14 measurements of surface and
   groundwater samples were used to identify recharge areas, and to
   evaluate aquifer residence times and flow paths. Recharge locations were
   constrained from the regional decrement in meteoric water delta(18)O
   values as a function of elevation, determined to be -0.23 parts per
   thousand per 100 m for small springs and creek waters collected along
   the western Cascade slope of this region. In general, the large-volume
   springs are lower in delta(18)O than surrounding meteoric waters, and
   are inferred to originate in high-elevation, high-precipitation regions
   up to 50 km away from their discharge points. Large spring C-14
   abundances range from 99 to 41\% modern carbon (pmc), and most show
   evidence of interaction with three distinct carbon isotope reservoirs.
   These reservoirs are tentatively identified as (1) soil CO2 gas
   equilibrated under open system conditions with groundwater in the
   recharge zone {[}delta(13)C(DIC) approximate to -18 parts per thousand,
   C-14 greater than or equal to 100 pmc], (2) dissolved carbon
   equilibrated with atmospheric CO2 gas {[}delta(13)C(DIC) approximate to
   +1 parts per thousand, C-14 greater than or equal to 100 pmc], and (3)
   dissolved carbon derived from volcanic CO2 gas emissions
   {[}delta(13)C(DIC) approximate to 0 parts per thousand, C-14=0 pmc].
   Many regional waters show a decrease in C-14 abundance with increasing
   delta(13)C values, a pattern indicative of interaction with dead carbon
   originating from volcanic CO2 gas. Several lines of evidence suggest
   that actual groundwater residence times are too short (less than or
   equal to 200 years) to apply radiocarbon dating corrections. In
   particular, water temperatures measured at springs show that deep
   groundwater circulation does not occur, which implies an insufficient
   aquifer volume to account for both the high discharge rates and long
   residence times suggested by C-14 apparent ages. The large springs also
   exhibit rapid decreases in flow during periods of drought that suggests
   a high level of aquifer interconnectivity to the recharge area. The
   estimated amount of volcanic CO2 dissolved in surface and groundwater
   originating from the Lassen highlands is consistent with the conversion
   of approximately 10\% of the geothermal CO2 flux into dissolved
   inorganic carbon.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical solutions are obtained by the Fourier transform technique for
   the one-, two-, and three-dimensional transport of a conservative solute
   injected instantaneously in a uniform groundwater flow. These solutions
   account for dispersive non-linearity caused by the heterogeneity of the
   hydraulic properties of aquifer systems and can be used as building
   blocks to construct solutions by convolution (principle of
   superposition) for source conditions other than slug injection. The
   dispersivity is assumed to vary parabolically with time and is thus
   constant for the entire system at any given time, Two approaches for
   estimating time-dependent dispersion parameters are developed for
   two-dimensional plumes, They both require minimal field tracer test data
   and, therefore, represent useful tools for assessing real-world aquifer
   contamination sites. The first approach requires mapped plume-area
   measurements at two specific times after the tracer injection. The
   second approach requires concentration-versus-time data from two
   sampling wells through which the plume passes. Detailed examples and
   comparisons with other procedures show that the methods presented herein
   are sufficiently accurate and easier to use than other available
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Estimates are presented for the long-term water balance of a sparse vine
   crop growing under semiarid conditions. The annual water losses are
   estimated using a simple soil moisture accounting model combined with a
   two-component energy combination model representing the separate but
   coupled evaporation fluxes from plants and bare soil. The models we
   calibrated using data collected during the European Field Experiment in
   a Desertitication-threatened Area (EFEDA) field experiment in the summer
   of 1991 in southern Spain. The hourly averaged meteorological conditions
   required as input to the model were derived both from field observations
   and using a stochastic model. For the year of the field experiment, the
   simulations suggested that the plant water consumption was close to the
   long-term average but that the groundwater recharge was substantially
   below normal. The sensitivity of this balance was examined using the
   stochastic model both for current conditions and for various
   hypothetical changes in the average rainfall, plant spacing and plant
   species.}},

Number = {{1-4}},

Abstract = {{Short-term variation of nitrogen concentrations must be considered when
   assessing longterm changes in forest ecosystems, and calculating
   accurate estimates of nitrogen export. In this study, 10 years of
   monthly concentration and daily flow measurements from 20 small forested
   catchments in Sweden and Finland were used to link concentrations to
   flow dynamics and/or seasonal variations, and to relate the detected
   links to catchment characteristics. The methods used included regression
   analyses and the non-parametric Wilcoxon test. Significant correlations
   between different nitrogen fractions and flow volume were found for most
   of the catchments, but in general flow volume only explained 20\% of the
   variation in NO3-N and organic-N, and 10\% of the variation in NH4-N
   concentrations. Both positive and negative correlations between
   concentration and flow were detected for the inorganic-N fractions,
   whereas for organic-N only positive correlations were recorded.
   Increasing flow conditions were often found to be associated with
   twofold median inorganic-N concentrations, especially during the spring.
   However, the most extreme seasonal variation was associated with the
   influence of the growing season, showing up to 20 times lower
   inorganic-N concentrations. Regarding NO3-N concentrations, high
   atmospheric nitrogen deposition appeared to moderate this seasonal
   influence whereas it was highest for catchments including lakes.
   Intensively drained catchments showed the quantitatively largest
   difference between growing and dormant seasons for NH4-N concentrations.
   In general, links between nitrogen concentrations and flow/seasons could
   be related to annual mean temperature, annual mean concentrations and
   the water regime of the catchments. The geographical heterogeneity of
   detected links and the still rather low explanation level for the
   concentration variation, show the importance of a more dynamic approach
   to nitrogen leakage where also catchment characteristics are included.}},

Abstract = {{A Monte Carlo study has shown that assessment of detrimental effects
   from urban storm drainage is very uncertain, even when state-of-the-art
   modelling techniques are used. A method to assess the relative
   importance of the individual contributions to the overall uncertainty is
   proposed, based on an analysis of the Monte Carlo simulations. The
   method can assess the importance of both continuous and discrete
   variables. Based on an analysis of two small ungauged catchments, it was
   found that the uncertainty in the description of the rainfall was
   generally the most important contributor to the overall uncertainty,
   followed by the uncertainty in the description of the surface runoff. In
   the evaluation of the extreme discharges of chemical oxygen demand (GOD)
   from combined sewer overflows the uncertainty in the concentration of
   COD was found to be the dominant factor. If the sewer system is poorly
   maintained the uncertainty in the hydraulic resistance may become
   important.}},

Title = {{On the stochastic theory of solute transport by unsteady and steady

Abstract = {{In this study the exact and approximate deterministic partial
   differential equations of the time-space evolution of mean solute
   concentration, of solute concentration two-point moment and of solute
   concentration n-point moment for conservative solute transport by
   unsteady and steady groundwater flow in a heterogeneous aquifer were
   developed in the real time-space domain under second-order cumulant
   expansion. These derivations were performed by means of the cumulant
   expansion method, combined with the calculus for the time-ordered
   exponential and with the calculus for Lie operator. The mean solute
   transport equations which describe the time-space evolution of mean
   conservative solute concentration under transport by unsteady and steady
   groundwater flows in a heterogeneous aquifer have convective-dispersive
   forms whose convective and dispersive coefficients are defined precisely
   in terms of the mean and covariance functions of the pore flow velocity
   random field. However, owing to the spatial nonuniformity of groundwater
   flow in heterogeneous porous media a new convective coefficient, besides
   the standard mean velocity vector, appeared in the derived mean solute
   transport equations in the case of steady flows. In the case of
   transport by unsteady groundwater flow in a heterogeneous aquifer, the
   new convective coefficient (besides the standard mean velocity vector)
   is due to the non-zero divergence of the pore flow velocity. The
   fundamental reason for the convective-dispersive form of the mean
   transport equations is the second-order truncation of the formal
   cumulant expansion. In the derived mean solute transport equations the
   macroscopic dispersion coefficient emerges as the time integral of the
   covariance function of the pore flow velocity. However, both in the case
   of transport by unsteady groundwater flow and in the case of transport
   by steady spatially nonstationary-nonuniform groundwater flow the
   macroscopic dispersion coefficients and convective coefficients vary
   with spatial locations within the porous medium. Only in the case of
   transport by steady spatially stationary-nonuniform flow are both the
   macroscopic dispersion coefficient and the convective coefficient
   constant with respect to spatial location within the heterogenous
   aquifer. Therefore, only in the case of conservative solute transport by
   steady spatially stationary-nonuniform groundwater flow in a
   heterogeneous aquifer does the mean transport equation apply to all
   spatial locations within the aquifer with the same parameter values at
   each time instant.}},

   forecasting is explored and developed further as the nearest neighbour
   linear perturbation model (NNLPM), which combines the nearest neighbour

Abstract = {{In this paper a shallow lagoon exchanging water with the sea and
   thermally interacting with its bottom is considered. The tidal motion
   has been assumed to be sinusoidal and the sea water has been assumed to
   be at the constant temperature T{*}. Finally, assuming no horizontal
   thermal gradient (i.e. the water is always well mixed) and using simple
   assumptions about the fluxes at the interfaces, the analytical solution
   of the system of equations is found (i.e. the temperature T(t) of the
   water and the temperature T-s(z, t) of the sediment). The model
   reproduces the qualitative thermal behaviour of a shallow lagoon such as
   that of Venice, where many experimental readings are available. In
   particular, it explains the main effect of the tide during winter, and
   the minor and perturbative effect (series of double peaks in the
   temperature trend) of the tide in the summer time.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a technique for the determination of a dynamic
   hillslope instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH) in concert with a variable
   saturation excess runoff production model using a grid-based digital
   elevation model (DEM). The total channel network responsible for routing
   the runoff produced on the catchment is divided into two parts: the main
   channel network and the hillslope channel network. The hillslope IUH,
   which routes water from the hillslopes to the main channel network, is
   essentially the solution of the linear advection-dispersion routing
   model weighted by the hillslope travel distance distribution of
   saturated pixels to the main channel network. The shape of the hillslope
   travel distance is found to consist of an initial spike, representing
   saturated pixels on the main channel network, and an exponential decay
   function for those pixels on the hillslope. However, the proportion of
   saturated pixels on the main channel network varies with total saturated
   pixels, causing an inverse change of scale of the spike and the
   exponential decay part. As the number of saturated pixels changes during
   a storm event, the hillslope IUH is dynamic. The main channel network
   IUH is also modelled by the linear advection-dispersion model weighted
   by the normalized width function of the main channel network.
   Convolution of the hillslope and main channel network IUHs gives the
   catchment IUH, which is also dynamically changing with the degree of
   saturation. It is demonstrated that the direct runoff hydrograph is
   sensitive to the variation of the degree of saturation within and
   between storm events.}},

Abstract = {{Floodwaves may be approximated as an advection-diffusion process when
   the typical Froude number is much smaller than one. The study refers to
   the effect of cross-sectional shape on the propagation of a
   single-peaked hood in a simple river having constant width, slope and
   roughness. The results are interesting in terms of how exact a shape
   geometry should be evaluated before proceeding to a detailed numerical
   computation of river floodwaves. The problem is generally solved by
   introducing a number of simplifying assumptions that do not detract from
   the essence of floodwave diffusion. The main parameters retained are the
   diffusion coefficient and the shape factor. The formulation of the
   problem is closed with appropriate boundary and initial conditions. The
   results of the numerical study are discussed in detail and expressions
   are presented for the main features of the floodwave, including the
   arrival of the wave front and the wave peak, as well as the peak
   discharge in terms of diffusion and cross-sectional shape. Using a
   different set of parameters, it can be demonstrated that the last two
   effects may be dropped for preliminary computations. Accordingly, the
   prediction of floodwave propagation can easily be accomplished.}},

Abstract = {{In this work a functional relationship between capillary pressure and
   wetting phase saturation has been developed. Both the imbibition and
   drainage of a wetting phase liquid into a porous medium consisting of
   clean unconsolidated silica particles have been considered. In all, two
   bead packings, with average particle diameters of 120 mu m and 360 mu m,
   and three liquids-water, ethanol, and refrigerant-113-were studied. It
   was found that the Leverett function worked very well in describing the
   relation between capillary pressure and saturation for each liquid using
   both packings; however, it did not provide adequate correlation for all
   three liquids. The functional relationship presented here considers the
   dependence of capillary pressure upon the contact angle of the
   fluid-solid interface, and also conveys how this dependence varies with
   saturation. The inclusion of the contact angle dependence provides
   extension of the correlation to any wetting phase liquid of uniform
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{In general, the dry and wet spells during a rainy season tend to persist
   and can be modelled using a Markov (order 1) process. The stochastic
   behaviour of the longest dry and wet spells can be predicted using the
   theory of runs, Poisson probability density function of the occurrence
   of spells, geometric distribution of the length of spells and the
   Weibull distribution of total rain over a wet spell (designated as
   rain-sum). The entire analysis can be carried out using only five
   parameters, namely, the probability of any day being a dry day (q), the
   probability of a dry day followed by the previous dry day (qq), the
   probability of a wet day followed by the previous wet day (pp), the mean
   (mu) and variance (sigma(2)) of the daily rainfall,sequences during a
   rainy season. The aforesaid modelling technique adequately simulated the
   length of the longest dry and wet spells, and the largest rain-sums for
   Kabete (semihumid) and Kibwezi (semiarid) in Kenya, East Africa.
   Rainfall in Kenya is generally characterized by a bimodal distribution
   with the short rains during November-December and long rains in
   March-May. A major application of the longest dry spell analysis is to
   predict extended drought durations during the growing season which forms
   a basis for planning the crop production strategies. The largest
   rain-sum analysis forms one criterion of designing rainwater catchment
   systems. The graphical comparison of cumulative distribution function of
   the simulated longest dry and wet spells with observed ones provides a
   powerful way of affirming the Markov persistence as against a customary
   chi-square test involving transitional probability matrices.}},

Abstract = {{Solutions of the Richards equation for wafer flow in variably saturated
   porous media are increasingly being used in water resources evaluation
   and environmental management. Besides the accuracy of solution, also of
   concern is the required computational effort, especially when highly
   nonlinear soil hydraulic properties and dry initial conditions are
   involved. In this paper we evaluate the performance of different
   convergence criteria when the modified Picard iteration method is used
   for solving the mixed-form Richards equation. Results are compared in
   terms of computer processing (CPU) time and number of iterations. A new
   nonlinear convergence criterion derived using a Taylor series expansion
   of the water content was implemented in the mixed-form numerical
   algorithm. The computational efficiency of the new criterion was
   evaluated against two widely used convergence criteria for different
   soil types, boundary conditions, initial conditions, and layered soils.
   Whereas all three criteria produced nearly identical results in terms of
   calculated water content, pressure head, and water flux distributions,
   all with negligible mass balance errors, the required CPU times were
   significantly different. In general, the new nonlinear convergence
   criterion was found to be computationally much more efficient than the
   other two criteria. The new criterion was also more robust (i.e. the
   solution remained convergent) fdr highly nonlinear flow problems for
   which the other two convergence criteria failed. Results of this study
   indicate that the new convergence criterion, when implemented in the
   modified Picard solution of the mixed-form Richards equation, produces a
   very efficient and accurate method for simulating variably saturated
   water flow in soils.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of cementation on the diffusivity of gas was determined in
   column experiments using four sandy sediments. Cementation of the
   sediments simulated various natural types of cementation. Naturally
   cemented marine carbonate sediment was also studied and compared with
   the laboratory-produced materials. The size, shape, and arrangement of
   the cemented material was determined using a scanning electron
   microscope (SEM).
   Based on the results of diffusion coefficient measurements in the
   laboratory, it is evident that the overall rate of gas diffusion through
   cemented layers can be controlled by the mass and geometry of the
   cemented material. General equations describing the diffusion
   coefficient- as a function of air-filled porosity for non-cemented
   porous media are not adequate for cemented materials because not all of
   the air-filled pore volume is available for gas diffusion. However, by
   evaluating the air space geometry and connectivity the general equations
   can be modified and shown to be appropriate for evaluating diffusion
   coefficients in cemented materials as well.}},

Title = {{Salinization owing to evaporation from bare-soil surfaces and its

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{178}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{109-136}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the relationship between evaporation and salinization,
   the surfaces of three columns of uniform porous materials, desert dune
   sand, silica sand and glass beads, respectively, were exposed to a
   temperature-, humidity- and/or wind-speed-controlled ambient atmosphere.
   For the dune sand, chemicals such as Na+, Ca2+, Cl- and SO42-, dissolved
   mainly from CaSO4, Na2SO4, CaCo3 and NaCl in the sand particles, caused
   marked salinization near the top surface, Slow dissolution of Na2SO4 and
   CaSO4 influenced the development of concentration profiles for SO42- and
   Na+ markedly for months after the beginning of the experiment, while the
   profile of Cl- was not affected directly, because dissolution of NaCl
   was rapid. Concentration profiles of Cl- for the glass beads and for the
   silica sand columns filled with a high concentration of NaCl solution of
   (10(4) mg l(-1) for Cl-), were analysed similarly.
   Experimental results suggested that the vapour flux in a dry soil became
   larger because of the increase in the gradient of the vapour density
   caused by greater chemical enrichment near the top surface compared with
   that at the evaporation surface. The vapour flux also became smaller as
   the gradient of the vapour density decreased, owing to the markedly
   enriched evaporation surface.
   In the experiment with glass beads, filled with the NaCl solution,
   solute crystallization (4-10 mm thick) was observed. For the dune sand,
   only when a turbulent airflow was applied did a crust (a few millimetres
   in thickness) form entirely on the top surface. Such deposition led to a
   reduction in the flux of water vapour as the permeable cross-sectional
   area decreased. The resistance to transfer increased three to ten times
   for the glass beads but only by 30\% for the dune sand. The lower
   increase for the dune sand may be due to penetration of the applied
   airflow into cracks in the crust.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the change in chemical composition of stream water
   was investigated for a small Atlantic salmon stream (Catamaran Brook) of
   the Miramichi River system in New Brunswick, Canada. Chemical
   composition of runoff and groundwater flow was established, as were
   relations between concentration of dissolved materials and discharge.
   Specific storm events were analysed to determine changes in chemistry
   and to carry out a hydrograph separation using specific chemical
   parameters. The hydrograph separation was used to identify the relative
   contribution of groundwater flow to total streamflow. By selective
   sampling of stream water during high flow (runoff) and low flow
   (groundwater) periods it was possible to observe the range in chemical
   composition of many parameters in Catamaran Brook. Most relationships
   between concentration of chemical parameters and discharge were
   significant at P < 0.0001, with sodium having the highest coefficient of
   determination (r(2) = 0.849). Concentration returned to pre-storm levels
   in approximately 10 days following an event. As observed in previous
   studies, the peak groundwater flow plays an important role during the
   storm hydrograph and can account for as much as 91\% of the total peak
   how for small events. For higher flow events in Catamaran Brook, the
   groundwater flow contribution was markedly lower (55\% of total
   streamflow). The composite hydrograph separation revealed that
   conductivity, as a single parameter, provided the best results in
   representing the composite separation.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous methods exist to express a region's flood regime, but because
   of the various controls on flooding, no salient method emerges. We have
   used directional (also known as orientation) statistics to express some
   of the hydroclimatological and geomorphic controls on flooding in New
   England and mapped these statistics for 36 gages to reveal the regional
   groupings of similarly responding basins. Directional statistics express
   the temporal variance of flood timings and characterize the seasonality
   of floods, and thus begin to demonstrate some of the climatic controls
   on flood timing and their spatial effects. Contour maps of the vector
   mean timing of floods indicate the strong control of coastal influences
   on the hydrologic regime, and multiple regression analyses indicate that
   both the surrogate variables for climate, latitude and distance to the
   coast, strongly explain the timing of the vector mean, although both the
   geomorphic variables, basin size and altitude, are also significant
   explanatory variables. An autumnal hood season exists along coastal
   locations but disappears moving both inland and northward through the
   region. For many of these coastal locations (especially in the south),
   the autumn mode reflects the occurrence of hurricane-induced floods
   which for many basins represent the largest hood in the annual series.
   The strength of the seasonality, as expressed by the mean resultant
   magnitude, is controlled primarily by basin size with distance to the
   coast and altitude also important. Finally, these results suggest that
   directional statistics are an appropriate method for depicting regional
   hydrologic regimes and in describing some of the hydroclimatological
   controls on flood occurrence.}},

Abstract = {{Arsenic and selenium concentrations along with the major solutes were
   measured in groundwaters sampled from springs in Pahranagat Valley and
   Ash Meadows, Nevada, Death Valley, California, and from wells from the
   Nevada Test Site and Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The multivariate
   statistical technique correspondence analysis was applied to the data to
   determine relationships between the groundwaters from these areas, the
   aquifer materials and the As and Se concentrations, and to examine the
   relationships between As and Se and the other chemical parameters
   included in the statistical analysis.
   The correspondence analysis indicates that a strong relationship exists
   between chloride and Se in the groundwaters and that As is not
   associated with chloride. The strong association between chloride and Se
   suggests that Se behaves more conservatively than As in these
   oxygenated, circumneutral pH groundwaters. No strong association was
   observed between the As and/or Se concentrations of the groundwaters and
   the aquifer material with which these waters interact (i.e. regional
   Paleozoic carbonate aquifer, Tertiary tuffaceous volcanic rocks, and/or
   basin-fill deposits). However, it is likely that sampling of
   groundwaters from the various aquifers was insufficient to determine
   relationships between the aquifer materials and groundwater chemistry.
   Associations were observed between the groundwaters of the Nevada Test
   Site and Yucca Mountain regions and the groundwaters of the regional
   carbonate aquifer that discharge at Ash Meadows and Death Valley,
   suggesting mixing of these waters. Groundwater from the regional
   carbonate aquifer in Pahranagat Valley, which is upgradient from the
   Nevada Test Site, Yucca Mountain, Ash Meadows, and Death Valley,
   exhibited no association with groundwaters from these regions.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater isotope data across the Sacramento Valley, California
   establish two types of groundwater mining: (1) overdraft of ancient
   groundwater with limited recharge by surface waters, producing cones of
   depression; (2) ancient groundwater withdrawal followed by rapid
   recharge of irrigation water, reducing groundwater quality. The first
   type occurs in the Sacramento metropolitan area, where meteoric runoff
   is unnaturally high and 40 years of pumping have depressed water levels
   to 25 m below sea-level; inducing recharge from losing reaches of the
   Sacramento and American rivers. Lateral migration rates are quantified
   by the binary mixing between river water (delta(18)O = -10.8) and
   natural groundwater (delta(18)O = -7.0). The second type of mining
   occurs in agricultural regions to the west, where C-14 ages indicate
   that irrigation waters constitute more than 80\% of modern recharge.
   This recharge has several characteristics of evaporated irrigation
   water, including: (1) high delta(18)O values (to > -6.0) that define
   closed contour patterns; (2) elevated NO3 concentrations (to 100 ppm);
   (3) low C-14 ages of less than 500 years.
   Stable isotope contours, augmented by C-14 data, provide dynamic
   recharge patterns in this profoundly disturbed, giant alluvial aquifer.
   On a large scale (> 100 km(2)), the lateral permeabilities of alluvial
   aquifers are essentially isotropic, whereas on a smaller scale (< 25
   km(2)), anisotropy is evident and isotope values can be geographically
   complex and seasonally transient. Groundwater flow patterns implied by
   the isotope data can differ substantially from steady-state models based
   on head measurements.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 11 vertical cores spaced 1 m apart along a single transect
   were extracted from the Borden aquifer at a location 60 m
   north-northeast from the site studied by Sudicky previously. Examination
   of these cores shows the upper 1.5-2.0 m of the aquifer to be comprised
   of relatively unstructured, fine to medium sands, underlain by a 0.1-0.8
   m thick peaty layer and a 0.1 m thick organic-rich horizon. Between
   depths of 3.05 and 6.10 m the aquifer is comprised of clean,
   horizontally bedded fine to medium sands similar to those examined by
   Sudicky previously. Statistical analysis of 642 subsamples of 5 cm
   length from this interval suggests that the permeability data may follow
   a log-normal distribution, with a mean In-transformed permeability
   (m(2)) of -25.67 and a variance of 0.585. No consistent trend with depth
   was detected for ln-k, or for the mean and variance of ln-k on a core by
   core basis. Exponential, spherical, and Gaussian models all provided
   excellent fits to the vertical experimental variogram calculated using
   the classical estimator without the removal of outliers. These fits
   produced correlation scales ranging from 0.16 to 0.23 m. Of the three
   theoretical models, only the Gaussian model produced a reasonable fit to
   the horizontal experimental variogram with a correlation scale of 4.8 m.
   A linear model was also found to fit the experimental variogram data
   well. In comparison with earlier results of Sudicky, and Woodbury and
   Sudicky, it can be concluded that similar deposits were examined in this
   study, particularly with respect to correlation structure. On the basis
   of statistical tests, however, it cannot be concluded that the mean and
   variance of ln-k are stationary over the 60 m distance between the cores
   examined in this study and those of Sudicky. The results of this study
   indicate that the Borden hydraulic conductivity held is relatively
   uniform over the scale examined, but that it cannot be characterized by
   a single, spatially invariant statistical distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Under certain conditions several ratios of fluxes in the surface energy
   budget are known to remain relatively constant during the daytime hours.
   This `self-preservation' has allowed the use of midday values of the
   evaporative fraction, EF, multiplied by the daytime total of net
   radiation minus the ground heat flux, to provide a good estimate of
   total daytime evaporation. A similar method is discussed, in which the
   daytime total sensible heat flux is divided by the noon Bowen ratio
   (beta = (1/EF)-1). Data from the First International Satellite Land
   Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) indicate
   that the two methods give rather different results. It is shown by
   propagating uncertainties that the uncertainty in the daytime total
   evaporation is likely to be smaller with the constant-EF method than
   with the constant-beta method for beta greater than about -1/2.}},

Abstract = {{A regional approach which was developed for managing environmental
   resources, known as an `ecoregional concept', was found useful for
   describing spatial water-quality patterns. Ecoregions, when defined
   within the framework of a river basin concept, provided a satisfactory
   explanation of water-quality variations occurring in the Tamiraparani
   basin, South India. The methodology consists of principal component
   analysis (PCA) of 23 features of the geological, geomorphological, basin
   morphometry and land-use aspects of the Tamiraparani basin defined in
   terms of 63 micro-basins. The PCA scores calculated on five components
   were used to cluster the micro-basins into groups based on a similarity
   measure. The groups identified in the analysis were traced on the
   drainage map to delineate nine ecoregions. A water-quality survey of the
   identified ecoregions was carried out: The PH, EC, DO, TDS, major ions
   and nutrients were estimated in 278 water samples. A PCA of the
   water-quality data revealed that three processes appear to be
   particularly important for water quality in this basin: the geological
   origin of ionic richness variables, nutrient leaching from agricultural
   operations, and the carbonate system. The spatial ability of ecoregions
   to account for regional variations in water quality was compared using
   two existing classification methods (hydrological and limnological).
   Water samples were grouped in terms of ecoregional, hydrological and
   limnological classifications, based on their location in the basin.
   visual examination of the box plots of water-quality variables showed
   that ecoregions have less within-region variation with statistically
   significant differences between the group means than either hydrological
   or limnological classification. Discriminant analysis displayed the
   relatively better ability of ecoregions to account for spatial
   water-quality variations than the other groups in the space defined by
   the first two discriminant functions representing the ionic richness and
   nutrient variability of the water samples.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastically generated hydrologic data have been used in the past by
   water authorities world-wide for long-term planning of water resources
   development projects. These data are also currently being used in short-
   and medium-term planning and operation of water resource systems. For
   valid and realistic results, it is necessary that the generated data
   sequences preserve all statistical properties of historical data. This
   paper presents an improved disaggregation method for generation of
   alternative sequences of monthly hydrologic data. The method is designed
   explicitly to preserve the over-year monthly serial and cross
   correlations, in addition to other monthly and annual parameters of the
   historic sequence. The method is applied to both single-site and
   multi-site cases, and compared with two other disaggregation models that
   are used in Australia. The comparison of results shows that the
   developed method satisfactorily preserves both monthly and annual
   statistical parameters of the historic data sequences including the
   over-year monthly correlations.}},

Abstract = {{The exploitation of land and water resources to sustain an
   ever-increasing population inevitably involves the utilisation for both
   urban and agricultural development of rural areas and the natural
   landscape. This process can result in profound changes to the how regime
   of river basins that are so affected, the scope and magnitude of which
   have been investigated by means of experimental catchment studies. The
   extensive data base that has resulted from such activities has provided
   a basis for developing a series of generalised relationships which can
   be used by water resources planners to anticipate the changes in water
   yield that can result from alterations to the predominant vegetative
   cover of a catchment. The application of fuzzy linear regression
   analysis to data from 145 experiments has shown that, for a 10\%
   reduction in cover, the yield from conifer-type forest increased by some
   20-25 mm, whereas that for eucalyptus-type forest increased by only 6
   mm. Both values were somewhat lower than those previously published, as
   was the 5 mm decrease in yield associated with a 10\% afforestation of
   scrub. A 10\% reduction in the cover of deciduous hardwood gave a 17-19
   mm increase in yield, broadly in line with earlier estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Analyses of water-quality variables for the Yarra River in South-Eastern
   Australia have shown that the relationship between species
   concentrations in the river and the river discharge is time dependent
   and non-linear. A simple dynamic model relating the time evolution of
   the total mass of chemical element in the catchment area to chemical
   loading in the river provides high-accuracy predictions of absolute and
   time-integrated values of the latter. Because the chemical loads in the
   river are controlled by the total mass of chemical element in the
   catchment area, the relationship between chemical concentration in
   stream water and river discharge reveals a hysteresis. A balance between

Abstract = {{A general analytical solution to the equation describing purely
   convective vertical transport of a conservative solute under transient
   water flow conditions is presented. Richards equation does not yield
   analytical solutions for the flow field, except under restrictive
   choices of hydraulic properties relating water content, hydraulic
   conductivity and the soil matric potential. The utility of the
   Green-Ampt model for homogeneous unsaturated soils is investigated as an
   alternative to Richards equation. This model, though approximate,
   provides analytical solutions to the flow field. It is found that the
   flow quantities required for the analytical solution of convective
   transport (specifically the soil water storage) are predicted accurately
   by the Green-Ampt model. Comparisons of numerical and analytical
   solutions of solute concentration profiles suggest that the Green-Ampt
   water flow model is adequate for convective solute transport
   predictions, and that the how held need not be computed by the more
   numerically expensive Richards equation for this problem.}},

Abstract = {{Hairsine and Rose developed a soil erosion model which described the
   erosion transport of the multiparticle sizes in sediment for
   rain-impacted flows in the absence of entrainment in overland flow. In
   this paper we extend their steady-state solutions to account for the
   time variation of suspended sediment concentration during an erosion
   event. A very simple approximate analytical solution is found which
   agrees extremely well with experimental data obtained from nine
   experiments. We are able to reproduce the rapid initial increase to a
   peak in the total sediment concentration, which occurs about 3-5 min
   after the commencement of rainfall, as well as the subsequent declining
   exponential tail towards steady-state conditions. We are also able to
   show that the fraction of shielding of the original soil bed resulting
   from depositing sediment reaches its equilibrium value on about the same
   time-scale as the total peak suspended sediment concentration.
   Interestingly, we find that the masses of the individual particles which
   form this deposited layer are far from equilibrium, and that there is a
   great deal of continuous reworking and sorting of this material during
   the erosion event. Finally, our solution shows that the initial peak in
   the total sediment concentration is due to the enrichment of this
   sediment by the finer size classes and that as the event continues their
   percentage contribution diminishes.}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{The variation of the infiltration capacity at a given location during
   steady rainfall having an intensity smaller than the initial
   infiltration capacity of the soil is investigated. Two distinct time
   periods are considered: one prior to pending, when the rainfall
   intensity is smaller than the infiltration capacity, and the second,
   which begins at the initiation of pending, when the infiltration
   capacity becomes smaller than the intensity of the steady rainfall. The
   duration of the first period depends on the intensity of the steady
   rainfall, as well as on the initial value of the infiltration capacity.
   If the initial infiltration capacity is at its highest value, the
   duration is defined as the steady rainfall pending time or, in short,
   the `ponding time' for the specified conditions. Estimates of the
   pending time and the variation in the infiltration capacity depend also
   on the model adopted to describe the infiltration process. The model
   used in this case is a simple two-element and three-parameter model
   described recently by Diskin and Nazimov (J. Hydrol., 172: 313-330,
   1995). Results obtained with this model are compared with literature
   values of pending time for a number of soil types. The agreement is
   reasonably good, leading to the conclusion that the proposed simple
   model is valid for describing the infiltration process.}},

   the database and allow, for example, the consequences of economic
   policies on agricultural production to be estimated in terms of
   predicted impact on water resources and ecological diversity within a
   basin. The two hydrological modelling systems employed in the NELUP DSS,
   namely SHETRAN and NUARNO, are described. The utility of the
   hydrological component is illustrated, making use of an application

Abstract = {{Extensive use of computers in water-resources planning makes the more
   efficient use of available information increasingly possible. It also
   promotes an iterative planning process by making analysis and evaluation
   more convenient. The concept of collaborative planning is an idea that
   has had limited use because of the complexities that prevent people with
   different backgrounds from communicating. A collaborative
   planning-support system (CPSS) integrates available computer
   technologies with modelling and analysis tools in a user-friendly
   environment, thereby enhancing communication between the proponent for
   resource development and affected or interested parties. CPSS does not
   provide solutions but empowers participants by identifying areas of
   common understanding, encouraging them to explore solutions and reach a
   consensus. Using the concept of `grounded theory' from social sciences,
   the CPSS module described in this paper is a tool for developing
   evaluation criteria. Use of the concept is illustrated by an example
   from northern Manitoba which focuses on fish habitat issues relating to
   a hydropower development project.}},

Abstract = {{The thesis of this paper is that it is necessary to look beyond the
   usual role of decision-support systems (DSS) as analytical tools for
   assisting operational management of water-resources systems. In
   particular, there is a need to include components capable of supporting
   the political, organizational and social dimensions of the
   decision-making process. With the help of a case study in
   water-resources allocation for the Colorado River, it is shown that
   decision-making is not as ill-structured as first appears and this
   should be exploited in the design of the DSS. In the case of the
   Colorado River, the overall approach has been decomposed into six
   aspects or `layers', each of which requires its own set of
   information-management tools. Classical decision-making perspectives are
   then used to explain the role of these layers and their significance for
   the development of a water-resources DSS.}},

   originally designed for the planning stage of decision-making associated
   with complex river basins. Subsequently, it was expanded to incorporate
   modules relating to the operational stage of decision-making.
   Computer-assisted design modules allow any complex water-resource system
   to be represented in graphical form, giving access to geographically
   referenced databases and knowledge bases. The modelling capability
   includes basin simulation and optimization modules, an aquifer dow
   modelling module and two modules for risk assessment. The Segura and
   Tagus river basins have been used as case studies in the development and
   validation phases. The value of this DSS is demonstrated by the fact
   that both River Basin Agencies currently use a version for the efficient
   management of their water resources.}},

Abstract = {{A realistic model of surface-atmosphere exchanges was created by
   coupling the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS) with an
   advanced, two-dimensional model of the atmospheric boundary layer. This
   was initiated and tested using data obtained from the First
   International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project Field
   Experiment (FIFE). This model was used to investigate the acceptability
   of simple rules for defining the aggregate value of the parameters
   required to specify surface interactions, as applied to heterogeneous
   mixes of vegetation types allowed in BATS but appropriate to the FIFE
   site, namely short and long grass, mixed crops, and irrigated crops.
   Under the range of meteorological and surface conditions relevant to
   FIFE and as used in this study, these rules are shown to estimate
   aggregate parameters which give surface fluxes similar to those
   calculated with an explicit representation of separate vegetation
   patches, except in the particular case of artificially wetted
   (irrigated) patches set in an otherwise dry landscape.}},

   the wells was monitored for 9 days after the subterranean application.
   (2) The mean concentration of Li+ in the young cladodes of the shrubs
   increased from a natural background of 1.8 +/- 0.8 mu g Li+ g(-1) dry
   mass to 91 +/- 18 mu g g(-1) within 24 h of application.
   (3) The mean concentration of Li+ was significantly higher in shrubs
   around the shallower well where a maximum of 184 +/- 52 mu g g(-1) was
   measured 5 days after application.
   (4) At the deeper well, mean concentration of Li+ averaged over the 9

Abstract = {{Rapid response tensiometers or TDR (time domain reflectometry) probes in
   soil profiles, or early arrival of solutes in groundwater or drainwater
   after a rain event, provide direct evidence of preferential flow in
   soils, However, little information about the amount and magnitude of
   preferential flow paths is obtained by such measurement methods. Here,
   two intensively sampled vertical trenches illustrate the effect of
   sample spacing and the effect of sample size on the detection of
   preferential flow paths. In a water-repellent sandy soil, a sample
   spacing of up to 22 cm over a distance of several metres is just
   sufficient to collect information about preferential flow paths. Using
   larger sample spacings, the water content distributions apparently
   became more horizontally stratified. Increasing the sample size by
   pooling pairs of adjacent 100 cm(3) soil samples over a distance of
   several metres, still allowed the detection of preferential flow paths.
   Preferential flow paths were no longer observed for larger sample sizes.
   Enlarging the sample size reduces the calculated standard deviation and
   coefficient of variation. As preferential flow paths may vary in space
   and time, so the optimal number of samples to detect these paths in
   vertical trenches may vary, indicating that sampling strategies need to
   be flexible in design.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of a polymeric and/or colloidal Al pool was demonstrated
   on an experimental basis in various natural acid soil solutions and
   stream waters, even in the pH range 3.3-4. A number of these waters were
   found to be undersaturated with respect to various relevant mineral
   phases (amorphous AI(OH)(3) and AlPO4, gibbsite, boehmite, variscite,
   imogolite, kaolinite, halloysite, jurbanite, basaluminite and alunite).
   Non-monomeric Al species should not occur in undersaturated aqueous
   systems in equilibrium; therefore the polymeric/colloidal Al pool
   observed in these undersaturated waters cannot be in equilibrium with
   monomeric Al. As a consequence, the traditional determination of
   saturation indices (SI) by model equilibrium calculation using total
   concentrations of every element is considered to be unreliable, and any
   valid procedure should involve the determination of monomeric species
   (or a part of them) by analytical speciation.}},

Abstract = {{Two new exact solutions are presented for uniform unconfined groundwater
   flow over a stepped base; one for a step down in the direction of flow,
   the other for a step up in the direction of flow. These are
   two-dimensional solutions of Laplace's equation in the vertical plane,
   and are derived using the hodograph method and conformal mappings on
   Riemann surfaces. The exact solutions are compared with approximate
   one-dimensional solutions which neglect the resistance to vertical flow.
   For small horizontal hydraulic gradients typical of regional groundwater
   flow, little error is introduced by neglecting the vertical resistance
   to flow. This conclusion may be extended to two-dimensional analytical
   models in the horizontal plane, which neglect the vertical resistance to
   flow and treat the aquifer base as a series of flat steps.}},

Abstract = {{MAGIC, a hydrochemical model of catchment acidification has been linked
   to a model, PROFILE, which estimates catchment weathering rates, in an
   application to a small forested catchment in the Montseny mountains of
   Catalonia (northeast Spain), to assess the effects of climate change on
   streamwater chemistry for a montane-Mediterranean region. Two scenarios
   of climate change are considered: a 4 degrees C temperature increase
   combined with 10\% precipitation increase and a 4 degrees C temperature
   increase combined with 10\% precipitation decrease. The modelled effect
   of a 10\% precipitation increase on the water partition between runoff
   and evapotranspiration is a slight dilution of the streamwater
   chemistry, Correspondingly, the modelled effect of a 10\% precipitation
   decrease is a sharp concentration increase in streamwater chemistry.
   Weathering rates increase with increased temperature and increased
   precipitation but are almost unaffected by increased temperature and
   decreased precipitation. Therefore, changes in streamwater
   concentrations, linked to the effect of weathering changes, appear only
   in the scenario with a warmer and wetter climate. The approach has also
   been used to assess the effects of changing air mass patterns caused by
   climate change as an increase in alkaline-rich rains associated with
   Sahelo-Saharan dust may well result. This study indicates that the main
   chemical changes following climate change will be associated with
   weathering rate changes rather than with changes in the atmospheric
   supply of base cations and alkalinity, The case for considering the
   effects of temperature and moisture availability in climate change
   models of soil and streamwater quality is shown to be overwhelming as
   rates of weathering are strongly influenced by these factors.}},

Abstract = {{The two-parameter generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) has been
   recommended for the frequency analysis of environmental extreme events,
   In the present paper, we concentrate on one form of the GPD (which Re
   will call GPD(B)) which can be useful in the Frequency analysis of two
   types of hydrological variables: (1) when the shape parameter ct is
   positive, the distribution (denoted by GPD(B)-2) can be used to study
   phenomena such as flood flows, which are bounded from below but have a
   long right tail; (2) when alpha is negative, the resulting distribution
   (GPD(B)-3) could be used to study variables such as low flows which are
   bounded from both sides but with a left tail. Six versions of the
   generalized method of moments (GMM) for fitting GPD(B) are investigated.
   The flexibility of the GMM provides the user with the possibility of
   choosing a version of the method (i.e. the moment pair that is used in
   fitting the distribution) which assigns larger weight to the larger
   elements of the sample. or ana ther version which gives more weight to
   the smaller elements, depending on the problem at hand. A general
   formula for the asymptotic variance of the T-year event X(T) Obtained by
   combining any two moments of GPD(B) is presented and applied, It is
   shown that the adequate choice of the order of these two moments to fit
   the distribution can lead, in some cases, to a considerable reduction in
   the variance of the estimator of X(T), in comparison with estimation by
   the traditional method of moments (which uses moments of order one and
   two). The performance indices that are used to compare the different
   versions of the GMM are based on root mean square error, bias, and
   variance - both asymptotic and observed (based on simulation) - of
   GPD(B) quantiles and parameters. It is shown that moments of order (0,
   -1) and (2, -1) lead to the best results when the shape parameter alpha
   is positive (GPD(B) - 2), and the traditional method of moments can be
   considered as most efficient for negative values of alpha (GPD(B) - 3).
   The GMM with moments of order 0 and one is shown to be rather consistent
   and moderately satisfactory for both GPD(B)-2 and GPD(B)-3.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the recharge process and its relationship with rainfall is
   of critical importance to the management of groundwater systems and
   enormous effort has been made to estimate the amount and process of
   recharge by infiltration using precipitation data. In the present
   research, in-situ lysimeter experiments and numerical simulations were
   used to study the relationships between rainfall and recharge by
   infiltration at different groundwater depths. Four lysimeters, 1.5, 3,
   4.5, and 5 m deep, were installed in the field to measure the
   infiltration recharge rates under conditions of fixed water tables at
   the bottoms of the soil columns. Annual infiltration recharges at
   different groundwater depths were obtained through the lysimeter
   measurements. The effect of rainfall pattern and annual rainfall
   distribution on infiltration recharge was simulated at various
   groundwater depths using a numerical model based on soil-water dynamics,
   and comparisons of the simulated and observed recharges showed very good
   agreement. Relationships between rainfall and infiltration recharge at
   different groundwater depths were investigated using the lysimeter

   classified into three categories, i.e. shallow water table, intermediate
   water table, and deep water table, based on the relationship between
   rainfall and infiltration recharge at different groundwater depths.}},

   calculates a pending time for the event and finds effective rainfall
   intensity and duration. The entire model was calibrated using a few
   events in three catchments in Saudi Arabia. The most important
   parameters are hydraulic conductivity and effective soil capillary
   drive. The model was found to predict peak discharges reasonably well,

Abstract = {{In this paper an analysis of stability and accuracy for numerical
   solution of the inverse problem for the Saint Venant equations is
   presented. For inverse flow routing a four-point implicit difference
   scheme with two weighting parameters theta and psi is used. This is the
   same scheme which with psi = 1/2 and theta greater than or equal to 1/2
   is used as the Preissmann scheme for the conventional solution of the
   Saint Venant equations. The numerical experiments presented by
   Szymkiewicz (J. Hydrol., 147: 105-120, 1993) showed that the numerical
   stability of an inverse flow routing requires different values of
   parameters psi and theta than for a conventional solution. This problem
   can be explained by Fourier analysis carried out for a linear hyperbolic
   system. From this analysis it is found that the four-point implicit
   scheme applied to inverse flow routing. is unconditionally stable if psi
   greater than or equal to 1/2 and theta less than or equal to 1/2. These
   conditions of stability are the inverse of the conventional solution.}},

Abstract = {{Widespread decline in the groundwater level and growth of salinization
   are the critical factors controlling future groundwater quality and
   availability in the Delhi area. delta(18)O and salinity data have been
   integrated for studying recharge conditions of phreatic aquifers and
   tracing the flowpaths of groundwater mixing. Wide range (-2.8 parts per
   thousand to -8.6 parts per thousand) and spatial inhomogeneity of
   delta(18)O in groundwater indicate that the aquifer is characterized by
   a slow process of natural mixing of groundwater in its lateral extent.
   There is infiltration of river water to the groundwater, in addition to
   the recharge from rainfall. Groundwater recharge in the area also occurs
   through stagnant water pools in low elevation areas where water surface
   run-off collects. Chloride concentration in groundwater has a wide range
   from 15 ppm to 5070 ppm with a log-normal frequency distribution
   indicating that the salt deposits in the area are not homogeneously
   distributed. The delta(18)O-Cl relationship clearly suggests mixing of
   multiple sources of high salinity groundwater with low salinity
   groundwater or river water along specific pathways. The data also
   indicates leaching of salts present in the soil during vertical recharge
   from rainfall and irrigation. Large lateral variation in chloride
   concentration indicates changes in evapotranspiration rate during
   recharge. Detailed investigations on identifying the potential
   recharging zones, flow-paths of mixing and recharge conditions will be
   useful to protect the groundwater resources from depletion and
   salinization.}},

Year = {{1996}},

Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{37-55}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{The quasi-linear form of Richards' Equation is used to analyze steady
   flow from a disc source with uniform flux density in a homogeneous soil
   with a shallow groundwater table. Additionally, a solution and examples
   are given for a cylindrical flow region, i.e. of a finite radial extent.
   Still more general solutions are presented for cylindrical sources,
   including the limiting cases of point and ring sources, both buried and
   on the surface. Results for point sources are of particular interest for
   developing solutions for a wide variety of source geometries. Before the
   main examples are presented, the solution for the disc source in a
   semi-infinite domain is compared with that from a disc source with
   uniform pressure head with the same total flow rate. The results verify
   that the effect of the source boundary condition is limited to a very
   small region adjacent to the source and lend credibility to using the
   solutions interchangeably. For a finite how depth, a shallow groundwater
   table is shown to dominate the pressure head held. Only near the source
   do the pressure heads compare to those of a very deep water table. The
   effect of a limiting finite radius is to make the flow appear more like
   the one-dimensional case except at the surface itself and close to the
   disc source. Future applications of the results include modeling
   preferential flow paths and checking purely numerical solutions of
   Richards' Equation.}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{It is important to simulate the major components of the hydrologic
   budget to determine the impacts of proposed land management, vegetative
   changes, groundwater withdrawals, and reservoir management on water
   supply and water quality. As acquisition of field data is costly and
   time consuming, models have been created to test various land use
   practices and their concomitant effects on the hydrologic budget of
   watersheds. To simulate such management scenarios realistically, a model
   should be able to simulate the individual components of the hydrologic
   budget. However, most field studies at the watershed scale attempt to
   measure only one component (e.g. total streamflow, evapotranspiration
   (ET), etc.) and are not suitable for validating individual components of
   a comprehensive model. A field study was completed in the 1950s to
   estimate several major hydrologic components including surface runoff,
   groundwater flow, groundwater ET, ET in the soil profile, groundwater
   recharge, and groundwater heights from measured data from three
   watersheds in Illinois. These data were used to validate a
   multicomponent water budget model called SWAT. Comparison of measured
   and predicted values demonstrated that each component of the model gave
   reasonable output and that the interaction among components was
   realistic. This fact should allow more realistic appraisal of various
   land use management practices on a basin-wide scale.}},

Abstract = {{Paired catchment studies have been used as a method to assess the
   effects of vegetation removal (timber harvesting) on streamflow
   responses including lowflows and peakflows, but particularly annual
   water yield. Paired catchment studies in the United States reporting on
   the effects of timber harvesting on annual water yields were compiled.
   In general, changes in annual water yield from forest cover reduction
   (or catchment area harvested) of less than 20\% could not be determined
   by hydrometric or streamflow measurement methods. The catchment studies
   were discriminated by hydrologic region, defined by temperature and
   precipitation regimes. This regionalization suggested that as little as
   15\% of the catchment area (or basal area) could be harvested for a
   measurable increase in annual water yield at the catchment level in the
   Rocky Mountain region as compared with 50\% in the Central Plains,
   although system responses are variable.
   Given changing world-wide objectives for forest land management,
   hydrologists will be asked to develop monitoring programs to assess the
   effects of multiple and temporally and spatially distributed land use
   activities on water resources. Less catchment area will be disturbed,
   thus monitoring programs must be carefully designed to obtain useful
   information. The concept of hydrologic recovery, i.e. return to
   pretreatment condition tends to be based on annual water yield, but also
   needs the evaluation of streamflow generation and routing mechanisms
   including lowflows and peakflows when compared with the pretreatment
   condition.}},

Abstract = {{Based on UK radar data, the distribution of coverage of an area by
   rainfall fields is analysed including the influence of spatial and
   temporal resolution of the data, size of the area, and topographic and
   climatic variations. The aim is to derive a method allowing the choice
   of a value of the coverage, for example within an atmospheric general
   circulation model. Two cases are distinguished: that of a coverage which
   is stationary with respect to the size of the area and that of a varying
   coverage for areas smaller than a critical size which is generally
   between 60 km x 60 km and 70 km x 70 km. For the stationary coverage, a
   proposed method consists of the selection, based on topography, of an
   average coverage <(epsilon)over bar>, for the given period, and the
   choice of a value of the coverage epsilon from a distribution of mean
   <(epsilon)over bar>, presenting some dependence on the season and the
   topography. The self-similarity of the coverage process for a wide range
   of area sizes leads to the determination of estimates of the fractal
   dimension and the examination of the temporal variation of this
   dimension. For the non-stationary coverage (within the mesoscale-gamma
   and lower mesoscale-beta ranges), parabolic curves allow a good
   approximation to the decrease of coverage with area size.}},

Abstract = {{From an analysis of British radar data, it is concluded that the series
   of consecutive rainfall coverages for a given area (e.g. a general
   circulation model grid-square) is strongly correlated. Consequently, in
   application of a rainfall disaggregation procedure, the choice of
   rainfall coverage at each time-step should not be independent of
   previous coverage. The series of areal rainfall depths may be used to
   represent part of this correlation by a simple regression based model.
   Improvements upon this representation based upon linear time-series
   models are examined here, but they are of limited use. A second model
   uses the strong correlation between logarithmic transforms of the
   coverage and of the mean areal depth. It provides a good reproduction of
   the autocorrelation structure of the observed time-series. The
   reproduction of the marginal distribution can be improved upon by adding
   a linear time-series component. Another model which uses correlations
   between the series of ratios of consecutive coverages and those of
   consecutive areal rainfall depths is more successful in reproducing the
   autocorrelations of the coverages while preserving the features of the
   marginal distribution of the coverage. It provides a method for the
   generation of successive coverages conditional-upon the knowledge of the
   areal rainfall depths.}},

Abstract = {{Our interest in understanding some of the mechanisms involved in the
   mineralization of the Great Bend Prairie aquifer of Kansas by salt water
   originating from Permian bedrock formations, which are fractured
   sandstones, has prompted this basic study. The fractured permeable
   formation is represented by a simplified conceptual model incorporating
   two sets of oblique and parallel fractures embedded in permeable blocks.
   The domain is initially divided into a completely freshwater zone
   overlying a completely saline water zone. However, the sharp interface
   originally existing between the saline and fresh water is subject to
   dispersion because of mixing in fracture intersections and between the
   fracture flow and the permeable block flow. Simulations based on the use
   of an appropriate numerical model developed in the present study have
   helped us to characterize dispersion of the sharp interface and creation
   of the transition zone. Relationships of transverse and longitudinal
   dispersion in the domain are also determined.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns the migration of a tracer slug injected into a
   fractured permeable formation. Basic transport processes are formulated.
   Dimensionless parameters governing transport phenomena in the domain are
   identified, and their effects are determined. A simplified conceptual
   model is employed for the quantitative evaluation of the physical
   phenomena associated with tracer migration in the domain. The analytical
   approach applied in this study provides some basic characteristics
   concerning the build-up and decay of tracer breakthrough curves.
   Characteristics of fracture networks incorporating a large number of
   fracture sectors are evaluated using a numerical finite difference
   scheme.
   It is shown that various time and length scales characterize the
   phenomena involved in tracer slug migration in a fractured permeable
   formation.
   It is found that, in cross-sections located at a small distance from the
   tracer injection point, two maximum values of tracer concentration are
   expected in the breakthrough curves. In cross-sections located at
   comparatively large distances from the tracer injection point, the
   breakthrough curves are similar to those characterizing an ideal porous
   media.}},

Abstract = {{Tomales Bay and its adjacent watershed are the location of integrated
   research on the C-NP-Si biogeochemical coupling between the land and
   coastal ocean and cycling of these materials within the bay. In the
   present paper, budgets have been constructed to describe the rainfall
   delivery of dissolved nutrients to the watershed and export of dissolved
   and particulate nutrients from the watershed, mostly in runoff. The
   quantity of dissolved materials, especially dissolved organic materials,
   delivered to the watershed by rainfall is about the same as the export.
   Suspended load transport represents the major net removal of C, N, and P
   from the watershed, and this flux shows large interannual variation.
   Runoff-adjusted particle flux from the watershed is small at present in
   comparison with estimates based on sedimentation rate in the bay over
   the past 130 years. This difference apparently cannot be explained by
   natural or managed interannual variation in runoff or by other obvious
   aspects of water management. We believe that changes in agricultural
   land use have led to recent decreases in erosion and removal of
   particulate materials from the watershed. Even though the watershed has
   been disturbed by agricultural practices over the past 130 years, the
   system as a whole appears largely to have recovered to steady-state
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Moisture recycling by evapotranspiration from vegetation is probably the
   most important mechanism sustaining rainfall on continental catchments,
   particularly in semiarid areas. A very simple and very useful parameter
   to evaluate moisture recycling is the annual runoff coefficient C-R. On
   continents, the proportion of rainfall recycled equals 1 - C-R, whereas
   the average number of times that a moisture particle returns as rainfall
   equals 1/C-R. Since the runoff coefficient is widely mapped, it is a
   very handy indicator to evaluate the importance of landuse practices in
   rainfall recycling. It is further stated that the idea of some water
   resources engineers that a high runoff coefficient is an asset for water
   resources development is a misconception. For the water resources
   management of continental areas, the most efficient use of water is made
   by minimizing runoff.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this study is to compare the application
   possibilities of different rainfall-runoff models and how to choose that
   which best corresponds to certain hydrological conditions. The system
   chosen for analysis lies in the Bolivian highlands. The region is
   drained by the River Desaguadero, which flows out of Lake Titicaca
   (altitude 3810 m), and into Lake Poopo (altitude 3686 m). Following an
   analysis of hydrological models in general, the conclusions are applied
   to the particular characteristics of the Bolivian highlands. A
   simulation procedure, based on the decomposition of the basin into
   elements, was used. Detailed provisions to represent the losses along
   one of the channel reaches led to significant improvements in the
   simulation. It is concluded that channel losses are due to the
   characteristic geographic position and the specific characteristics of
   the system. The results of the study suggest that modelling of the
   surface water runoff may be applied with success in the Bolivian
   highlands but that the present, commonly used, methods are inadequate
   and adjustments are necessary.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the development and application of a technique
   which permits the analysis and improvement of hydrological models for
   the management of water resources of complex systems. Considering that
   such models are intended for practical application, the model was
   applied to the conditions of the Bolivian highlands. The model consisted
   of a deterministic part (HEC-1 model) linked to a stochastic component.
   The experience acquired indicated the possibility of adapting a more
   general procedure to compensate for the lack of rigour in the
   homoscedastic and independence hypothesis of the residuals. Use of this
   concept improved the estimation accuracy of the parameters and provided
   independent residuals with constant variance. A Box-Cox transformation
   was used to stabilize error variance and an autoregressive model was
   used to remove autocorrelation in the residuals.}},

Abstract = {{The sensitivity of the output to the parameter values of a hybrid model
   (HEC-1 model) with one stochastic component added is considered in the
   context of the Bolivian highlands. First-order and Monte Carlo analysis
   techniques were used to establish the influence of each parameter in the
   model. The greatest contribution to uncertainty in the model estimation
   corresponds to the initial loss (IL) and the uniform loss (CL)
   parameters. However, it is important to recognize that large variation
   in output may also be caused by differences in the spatial distribution
   of precipitation (a low-density network). Other parameters of the model
   structure (TC and (S-R)) and the parameters defining the concentration
   of flow had less effect. If it were possible to estimate the net
   rainfall with greater precision the concentration parameters could
   easily be adjusted to meet the requirements of accurate representation
   of peak flows.}},

Abstract = {{A Neyman-Scott clustered point process model for rainfall is developed
   for use in storm sewer rehabilitation studies in the UK, where
   predictions are needed of the frequency of system overloading for
   existing and upgraded conditions. In the first part of this two-part
   paper, a flexible model fitting procedure is presented which involves
   matching approximately a chosen set of historical rainfall statistics,
   which exceeds in number the set of parameters. In fitting the model to
   hourly data, it is found that wet and dry spell transition probabilities
   should be included in the chosen set of statistics rather than lag 1
   autocorrelations, as they improve the model's fit to the historical dry
   spell sequences. In fitting the model to daily data, estimates of the
   variances of sub-daily rainfall totals derided from regional regression
   relationships are used to ensure that sub-daily totals generated by the
   fitted model exhibit the desired statistical behaviour. A number of
   validation checks are carried out on simulated time series, which
   include visual comparisons with historical series, and comparisons of
   crossing properties and of the distributions of daily annual maximum
   rainfalls. Overall, the results support the use of the model for its
   intended application.}},

Abstract = {{The Neyman-Scott Rectangular Pulses rainfall model is fitted to daily
   and hourly data taken from 112 sites scattered throughout the UK. The
   model is regionalised by regressing estimates of the model parameters on
   harmonic and site variables, This allows the model to be applied to
   catchments where data do not exist or are limited. Percentage errors
   between the second-order properties at the 112 sites and those predicted
   by the regionalised model were found to be less than the sampling error
   (expressed as a percentage of the mean) typically found in a 20 year
   record of historical rainfall data, which suggests that the regionalised
   model can be used with reasonable confidence. A method of disaggregating
   the hourly rainfall time series to 5 min rainfall time series is further
   developed and tested. Thus, the regionalised model can be used to
   generate data with a resolution of 5 min if required. Some validation
   tests carried out with storm sewer system models indicate that the
   performance of the model is satisfactory for its intended application.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Volume = {{175}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between the spatial variability of rainfall and
   catchment response is investigated by conducting experiments with a
   stochastic rainfall field model and a physically based distributed
   modelling system, the Systeme Hydrologique Europeen (SHE), both of which
   are calibrated for a small upland catchment. The development and
   calibration of the rainfall field model is described in Part 1 of this
   paper, and the experiments with simulated rainfall fields and the SHE
   catchment model are described in Part 2. The rainfall field model is
   based on the use of the Turning Bands Method (TBM) incorporating a
   fractionally differenced line process to generate Gaussian random fields
   with a specified space-time correlation structure which can be isotropic
   or anisotropic. A transformation is then applied to the Gaussian field
   to reproduce the non-stationary temporal structure and skewed marginal
   distribution of observed rainfall. The transformed field is then
   propagated in space with the required velocity. The model is calibrated
   using hourly data for ten storms observed at three sites in the upper
   Wye catchment (area 10.55 km(2)) at Plynlimon, Wales. As rainfall over
   the catchment exhibits significant variation with altitude (and other
   factors), an altitude correction factor is applied to the simulated
   rainfall fields. Comparisons of the means, variances, skewnesses, cross-
   and autocorrelation functions of observed and simulated storms at the
   sampling points show good agreement, and realistic spatial patterns are
   observed in the simulated fields. A procedure is developed and applied
   for generating conditional simulations whereby the historical storm
   rainfall at the sampling points can be reproduced exactly in simulated
   fields, thus allowing several realizations of the unobserved spatial
   variability of rainfall at all other points in the catchment to be
   generated for any historical storm.}},

Abstract = {{A new stochastic model of space-time rainfall, the Modified Turning
   Bands (MTB) model, is proposed which reproduces, in particular, the
   movements and developments of rainbands, duster potential regions and
   raincells, as well as their respective interactions. The ensemble
   correlation structure is unsuitable for practical estimation of the
   model parameters because the model is not ergodic in this statistic, and
   hence it cannot easily be measured from a single real storm. Thus, some
   general theory on the internal covariance structure of a class of
   stochastic models is presented, of which the MTB model is an example. It
   is noted that, for the MTB model, the internal covariance structure may
   be measured from a single storm, and can thus be used for model
   identification.}},

Abstract = {{The Modified Turning Bands (MTB) model is used to produce synthetic data

   accuracy to which the raincell parameters of the MTB model (raincell
   velocity, diameter, lifetime, peak intensity and average spatial
   density) can be estimated. Two different techniques are used for the
   estimation problems: full correlation analysis for the velocity,
   diameter and lifetime, and the internal covariance analysis developed
   theoretically in Part I of this paper for the estimation of maximum
   rainfall intensity and average density. Having determined the accuracy
   that can be obtained using synthetic, error-free radar data, thus giving
   an upper bound on the accuracy which can be achieved in practice, the
   methods are applied to real data to gain insight into the ranges and

Abstract = {{Methods are developed which project two-dimensional radar rainfall data
   into one dimension such that the overall storm profile can be measured.
   As a result, it is found that the storm width and velocity can be

   velocity remains elusive. Thus it is concluded that more work has to be
   done involving many real storms so that the problems of estimating these
   parameters may be understood more fully, leading, it is hoped, to
   suggestions for new approaches. As regards longer-term work, the various
   roles which the Modified Turning Bands (MTB) model may play in the
   estimation and forecasting of rainfall are discussed, and the potential
   for the model in the investigation of the rainfall-runoff
   characteristics of catchments is outlined.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Number = {{1-4}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The first test of the snowmelt component of the Systeme Hydrologique
   Europeen (SHE) hydrological modelling system is reported, in which the
   SHE is used to simulate a 12 1/2 day period of snowmelt runoff for a 40
   ha subbasin of the Reynolds Creek rangeland research basin in Idaho. The
   results show the SHE to be capable of successfully simulating hydrograph
   responses caused by snowmelt generated by heat inputs, especially net
   radiation and sensible heat transfer. The results also show how, in the
   absence of previous field studies of basin response, the SHE can be used
   to investigate different hypotheses of basin behaviour. In this case,
   four hypotheses of basin response are examined, based on different
   representations of the soil permeability and subsurface flow pathways:
   (1) impermeable (frozen) ground surface; (2) fully permeable soil
   profile throughout the basin; (3) reduced soil permeability away from
   the channel; (4) rapid, near-channel subsurface response. Comparison of
   the measured and simulated hydrographs supports Hypothesis 4, with a
   possible cause of the response being the rapid conversion. of a
   near-surface, tension-saturated capillary fringe into a
   pressure-saturated zone by the infiltrating meltwater. In the absence of
   direct measurements of net radiation and wind gradient, indirectly
   derived values are used as input to the snowmelt component. The
   implications which the uncertainty attached to these values holds for
   the simulation results is investigated in sensitivity tests which show
   that, with sensible heat transfer forming the major heat flux to the
   snowpack, greater uncertainty is introduced into the simulation results
   by the uncertainty in the wind gradient than by the uncertainty in the
   net radiation. The snowmelt simulations are based on an energy-budget
   option: a test of a temperature-based (degree-day) option shows
   comparable accuracy but only through empirical fitting. Overall the
   study shows that a greater hydrological expertise is required in
   operating SHE-type models compared with simpler models.}},

Abstract = {{SHESED is introduced as a physically based, spatially distributed
   erosion and sediment yield component for the existing SHE hydrological
   modelling system, for use at the catchment scale. For hillslopes
   (represented spatially by the SHE grid square network) SHESED simulates
   soil erosion by raindrop impact, leaf drip and sheet overland flow
   (without rilling), and the transport of the eroded material by overland
   flow. For channels the component simulates the erosion of bed material
   and the downstream transport of this material together with that
   supplied by overland flow, In the channel sediment routing procedure it
   is assumed that the flow can carry any available load of fine sediments
   (less than 0.062 mm in diameter) but for coarser sediments the load is;
   limited by the calculated capacity transport rate of the how. The
   channel component also allows for bed armouring. Application of SHESED
   to rainfall-induced sediment yield events at two agricultural catchments
   (areas 5.1 and 6.4 ha) in Iowa shows generally good reproduction of the
   observed temporal variations in sediment yield. Application to a 3.3 km
   reach of the East Fork River, Wyoming, for a 37 day period shows good
   reproduction of observed sediment discharge magnitudes but some
   discrepancy in the timing of the simulated sediment discharge peak.}},

Abstract = {{It has been recognised that a flood propagation routine that operates
   within the framework of a real-time flood forecasting service should use
   hydraulic numerical models-simplified for steep reaches but based on the
   complete de Saint Venant equations when the free surface slope is small.
   Using as state variable the steady-state discharge, instead of the water
   level corresponding to it, the authors identify a `homogeneous set' of
   five flood routing models, going from complete to kinematic. To choose
   the most accurate and economic model, the suggested criterion, based on
   the analysis of sinusoidal solutions of the linearised wave propagation,
   is the ratio between the desired time resolution and a channel response
   time, which is correlated with the slope. Congruence of spatial steps
   with the temporal ones is discussed; some numerical examples,
   illustrating accuracy and economy of the proposed numerical models, are
   presented.}},

Title = {{A conservative finite elements approach to overland flow: The control
   volume finite element formulation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Volume = {{175}},

Pages = {{267-291}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes the control volume finite element (CVFE) method, a
   locally conservative formulation of the better known finite elements
   (FE) approach, to deal more effectively with overland flow. The
   two-dimensional overland flow problem is introduced and several
   approaches available in the literature are briefly reported. The partial
   differential equations describing overland and channel processes are
   then presented and a consistent two-dimensional formulation for the head
   losses is introduced. The derivation of the CVFE discrete formulation is
   preceded by a discussion on the classical integrated finite difference
   (IFD) and FE approaches, together with their advantages and
   disadvantages. The CVFE formulation is shown to improve on both
   approaches, resulting in a better representation of the gradients than
   that of the IFD approach and, in contrast to the FE, allows for the
   conservation of mass at local scale. The preliminary results obtained
   with a CVFE computer code are presented and compared with analytical
   solutions. Finally, several computational aspects are discussed, such as
   the formulation of the time integration, the representation of the water
   volumes pertaining to each node of the space discretization mesh and the
   explicit imposition of the local mass balance.}},

Abstract = {{The TOPMODEL is a variable contributing area conceptual model in which
   the predominant factors determining the formation of runoff are
   represented by the topography of the basin and a negative exponential
   law linking the transmissivity of the soil with the distance to the
   saturated zone below the ground level. Although conceptual, this model
   is frequently described as a `physically based model' in the sense that
   its parameters can be measured directly in situ. In line with the
   analysis of various conceptual rainfall-runoff models conducted by
   Franchini and Pacciani (J. Hydrol., 122: 161-219, 1991), a detailed
   analysis of the TOPMODEL is performed to arrive at a closer
   understanding of the correspondence of the assumptions underpinning the
   model with the physical reality and, in particular, the role that
   topographic information (expressed by the topographic index curve) and
   the nature of the soil (expressed by saturated hydraulic conductivity
   and its decay with soil depth), have within the model itself. Also
   investigated is the extent to which the model parameters actually
   reflect the physical properties to which they refer and how far their
   values offset the inevitable schematisation of the model. The various
   applications to real situations include the Sieve basin (river Arno
   tributary), which was used for the comparison of conceptual
   rainfall-runoff models described in the above-mentioned study by
   Franchini and Pacciani. This allows that analysis to be extended to the
   TOPMODEL.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes in detail a semi-distributed conceptual
   rainfall-runoff model known as the ARNO model, which is now in
   widespread use both in land-surface-atmosphere process research and as
   an operational flood forecasting tool on several catchments in different
   parts of the world. The model, which derives its name from its first
   application to the Arno River, incorporates the concepts of a spatial
   probability distribution of soil moisture capacity and of dynamically
   varying saturated contributing areas.
   The ARNO model is characterized by two main components: the first and
   most important component represents the soil moisture balance, and the
   second describes the transfer of runoff to the outlet of the basin. The
   relevance of the soil component emerges from the highly nonlinear
   mechanism with which the soil moisture content and its distribution
   controls the dynamically varying size of the saturated areas mainly
   responsible for a direct conversion of rainfall into runoff. The second
   component describes the way in which runoff is routed and transferred
   along the hillslopes to the drainage channels and along the channel
   network to the outlet of the basin. Additional components, such as the
   evapotranspiration, snowmelt and groundwater modules, are also
   described. A discussion on the advantages of the model, calibration
   requirements and techniques is also presented, together with the
   physical interpretation of model parameters.
   Finally, after describing the original calibration of the ARNO model on
   the Arno basin, and a comparison with several conceptual models, recent
   applications of the ARNO model, as part of a real-time flood forecasting
   system, as a tool for investigating land use changes and as an
   interesting approach to the evaluation of land-surface-atmosphere
   interactions at general circulation model (GCM) scale, are illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to illustrate the contribution that
   geostatistical techniques can make to risk assessment for buried waste
   repositories. For a hypothetical repository site in Bedfordshire, UK,
   multiple realisations of the hydraulic properties of the principal
   aquifers are constructed. For each realisation a numerical model
   describing the groundwater flow regime at the site is used to predict a
   possible pattern of migration based on the available hydrogeological
   data, A statistical analysis of the results is carried out to provide
   quantitative measures of the uncertainty in the patterns of migration
   deriving from a lack of knowledge of the media properties.
   In the first part of this two-part paper, the formulation of the
   conceptual and numerical models describing the regional groundwater flow
   regime is presented, A detailed assessment of the site has been
   undertaken to determine the principal hydrogeological formations within
   which contaminant migration would occur and the principal controls
   governing regional groundwater flow and contaminant transport. From the
   resulting conceptual model a quasi-three-dimensional groundwater flow
   and transport model has been developed. Part 2 of the paper describes
   the simulation experiments carried out using this model and the analysis
   of the results.}},

Abstract = {{A geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH) consists of two
   components, one relevant to the geomorphology and the other to the
   hydraulic aspect describing the movement of a drop of water along a
   stream. Different formulations of the geomorphologic IUH are reviewed,
   and a contrast is drawn between the geomorphologic and hydraulic
   components of the geomorphologic IUH (GIUH) proposed by Rodriguez-Iturbe
   and Valdes (Water Resour. Res., 15(6); 1409-1420, 1979) and those of a
   width function based IUH (WFIUH). In this paper a comparison has been
   carried out of the original GIUH and a WFIUH which allows the effects of
   different geomorphologic and hydraulic components to be identified. The
   comparison, which is based on four sub-basins of the River Tyne, UK,
   clearly shows that the GIUH velocity parameter lacks physical
   interpretation, in contrast to the hydraulic parameters of the WFIUH,
   which are seen to be physically consistent. For practical application of
   the GIUH, an equation is then proposed to estimate the velocity
   parameter through the basin concentration time, the Horton length ratio
   and the length of the stream of the highest order of the channel
   network.}},

Abstract = {{An extension to the integrated finite difference method, applied to
   two-dimensional problems, has been developed that permits a more
   accurate approximation of the governing equations for groundwater flow
   and mass transport in heterogeneous anisotropic media. The method adopts
   a linear two-dimensional interpolation over triangular elements for the
   numerical evaluation of gradients at any point of the spatial domain.
   Applications of the method are presented for various test cases. A
   comparison is also made between the results obtained by applying both
   the extended method and the finite element method to the same test
   problems. This comparison illustrates the utility of the extended
   integrated finite difference method for simulating flow in anisotropic
   media. The application of an automatic calibration procedure, based on
   Kalman filtering, to several test problems and the validation of the
   resulting models further confirms the advantages of the new formulation.
   The sources of error introduced by ignoring anisotropy in the integrated
   finite difference method are found to be significant in the cases
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model is formulated and used to investigate chloride
   migration in the chalk aquifer beneath effluent lagoons to the north of
   Royston, Hertfordshire, UK. The aquifer is characterised as a
   dual-porosity medium in which lateral advection and hydrodynamic
   dispersion are dominant in the fissure system whereas molecular
   diffusion is dominant in the chalk matrix. The Galerkin finite element
   method is used to solve the equations of flow and transport in the
   fissure system. A recurrence relationship is found which permits the
   coupling to the fissure model of a truncated series approximation to the
   analytical solution for one-dimensional diffusion in the surrounding
   porous matrix. The combined model has been calibrated using data
   collected between 1975 and 1979, and predictive simulations have been
   performed for the period from 1979 to 1986. The results are compared
   with data collected in 1986, The model is found to produce acceptable
   estimates of the spread of the chloride plume. The value of the model

Abstract = {{The stochastic storm transposition (SST) technique has been developed
   and evaluated in previous studies for the estimation of exceedance
   probabilities of extreme precipitation depths. In this study it is
   extended to the estimation of exceedance probabilities of extreme design
   floods, The link between storms and flood peaks is provided by a
   rainfall-runoff transformation and stochastic descriptions of antecedent
   moisture conditions and storm depth temporal distributions. Cumulative
   average catchment depths produced by the SST approach have been
   converted to a range of possible flood peak values using a
   rainfall-runoff model (the ARNO model) and a probabilistic
   disaggregation scheme of cumulative storm depths to hourly data. The
   analysis has been repeated for a range of fixed antecedent moisture
   conditions. The probabilities of exceedance of the produced flood peaks
   have been estimated and compared to highlight the effect of antecendent
   moisture conditions on the magnitude and frequency of produced floods as
   compared with the magnitude and frequency of the corresponding average
   catchment depths.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an integrated hydrological and hydraulic modelling
   approach for the risk assessment of a flood-prone area and its
   application to analysing the effects of extreme flood events on the
   Montalto di Castro thermoelectric power plant. The approach is based on
   four major steps, The first step entails a detailed analysis of
   available critical events as well the collection of hydro-meteorological
   and cartographic data to perform a statistical evaluation of extreme
   rainfall events and an estimation of the probable maximum precipitation
   (PMP). The second step involves the calibration of a rainfall-runoff
   model for the upper catchment area based on the data observed during a
   recent flood event. The third step involves the calibration of a
   two-dimensional hydraulic model for simulating the flood plain
   inundation using the previously reconstructed runoff and a comparison of
   the results with the maximum flood levels observed during the same
   event. The fourth and final step concerns the simulation by the
   two-dimensional hydraulic model of the flood wave obtained via the
   rainfall-runoff model using the extreme and PMP values of rain defined
   in the first step. The results of this approach appear to be extremely
   useful and easily transferable to other areas.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{175}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{555-566}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with a theoretical approach to assessing the effects of
   parameter estimation uncertainty on both Kriging estimates and their
   estimated error variance, by no longer considering the variogram
   parameter estimates as fixed values (as is conventionally done) but
   rather as realisations of random variables, the true values of which are
   unknown. By means of a second-order Taylor expansion, an approximate
   expression for the Kriging estimates is obtained as a function of the
   parameter estimates; subsequently, by taking expectations, an
   approximation both for the expected value of the Kriging estimates and
   for their variance is obtained. A maximum likelihood estimator for the
   parameters is also formulated, which allows for estimating the variance
   covariance matrix of the parameters as the inverse of the Fisher
   information matrix.
   Within the limits of the proposed approximation, the conventional
   Kriging estimates are shown to be biased for all variograms, the bias
   depending upon the Kriging interpolating weights' second-order
   derivatives with respect to the parameters times the variance-covariance
   matrix of the parameters (both functions of the variogram model
   adopted). Moreover, the conventional Kriging variance estimate is always
   underestimated by a factor which depends upon its second-order
   derivatives with respect to the parameters times the variance-covariance
   matrix of the parameters. This underestimation not only modifies the
   spatial distribution of the Kriging variance, but may also induce the
   adoption of the wrong model, given that the choice of a specific
   variogram is generally performed by comparing the Kriging variances
   generated by the different models.}},

Abstract = {{The paper introduces a new method for the solution of the inverse
   problem, that is, the estimation of parameters characterizing the
   hydrodynamic behaviour of aquifers given their geometrical description,
   the piezometric field, the net infiltration (infiltration minus
   abstractions) and the boundary conditions. The method, which falls in
   the class of Bayesian estimators, is based upon a Kalman filtering
   formulation which optimally combines a priori parameter values with the
   information contained in the observations to obtain the a posteriori
   parameter estimates. In that respect it can also be viewed as an
   extension of the subjective weighting method proposed by Neuman and
   Yakowitz (Water Resour. Res., 15(4), 1979). An example of the
   application of the proposed method to two Libyan aquifers is presented,
   showing the statistical adequacy of the resulting permeability estimates
   when compared with the permeabilities obtained at a number of points by
   means of pump tests.}},

Abstract = {{Validation methods commonly used to test catchment models are not
   capable of demonstrating a model's fitness for making predictions for
   catchments where the catchment response is not known (including
   hypothetical catchments, and future conditions of existing catchments
   which are subject to land-use or climate change). This paper describes
   the first use of a new method of validation (Ewen and Parkin, 1996. J.
   Hydrol., 175: 583-594) designed to address these types of application;
   the method involves making `blind' predictions of selected hydrological
   responses which are considered important for a particular application.
   SHETRAN (a physically based, distributed catchment modelling system) is
   tested on a small Mediterranean catchment, The test involves
   quantification of the uncertainty in four predicted features of the
   catchment response (continuous hydrograph, peak discharge rates, monthly
   runoff, and total runoff), and comparison of observations with the
   predicted ranges for these features. The results of this test are
   considered encouraging.}},

Abstract = {{Parametric studies were carried out to investigate the effect of uniform
   recharge on sea water intrusion into coastal aquifers using a
   one-dimensional finite element model. For this purpose, uniform recharge
   over the entire length of intrusion for a wide range of practical
   aquifers is considered. Useful relationships have been established
   between the interface motion and the intensity and duration of uniform
   recharge. These relationships can be used to estimate the repulsion of
   sea water intrusion owing to rainfall. This repulsion under favourable
   conditions is estimated to reach a maximum of about 5\%. The effect of
   uneven distribution of rainfall is demonstrated through an example,
   Movement of the interface is also tracked after the cessation of
   recharge.}},

Abstract = {{A physical-mathematical model is proposed to describe hourly dynamics of
   water and heat transfers in a forested watershed which is conceptually
   divided into seven sub-compartments. Hourly, daily and annual water
   yield, evapotranspiration loss and canopy-soil temperatures are
   simulated. Inter-connecting energy budget and water balance processes
   are integrated by simultaneously solving related equations with a
   specific feedback-iteration method. Emphasis is placed on interaction of
   transpiration and soil water status, on nonlinear and nonuniform
   overland flow, and on the controlling function of each storage on water
   fluxes. The model is calibrated by using the SIMPLEX optimization, at
   the Shirakawatani catchment in Western Japan, with hydrometeorology data
   for 2 years. Simulated annual water yield deviated from the observations
   by only 1.65\%, hourly, or daily runoff was statistically correlated to
   observed runoff at a level of 0.916 or 0.976, and flood process, leaf
   and soil temperature patterns were fitted well.}},

Abstract = {{An extensive set (n approximate to 100) of environmental tritium (H-3)
   data was acquired from the forested 187 km(2) Falling Creek watershed in
   the southeastern Piedmont Province of Georgia (USA). Time-series
   analyses of major ion concentrations and delta(18)O ratios were utilized
   in conjunction with the H-3 results to interpret probable source area
   contributions to streamflow and the timing of water storage in the
   shallow subsurface. delta(18)O values within baseflow varied seasonally
   (-5.8 parts per thousand < delta(18)O < approximate to 3.5 parts per
   thousand), consistent with well-established major-ion geochemical
   trends. Seasonal H-3 variation in streamflow and ground water was not
   systematic. The average H-3 concentrations in baseflow (18.4 TU (Tritium
   Units)) and storm runoff (16.9 TU) were significantly less than ground
   water sampled from an upslope site (approximately 30 TU). The relatively
   high degree of isotopic variation and the prominent difference between
   H-3 concentrations in baseflow and ground water indicate that much of
   the annual discharge is generated from the transient saturation and slow
   release of ground water from a source in the near-stream zone. Results
   of a statistical model based upon decay-corrected H-3 input
   concentrations indicate that the mean age of the ground water is between
   20 and 40 years and that most of the ground water released as baseflow
   has been stored for at least one or two decades. Another mixing model,
   based upon the comparison of observed and computed coefficients of
   variation for H-3 and delta(18)O, indicated that `event' water
   (precipitation from a given storm) probably makes up less than 10\% of
   the shallow subsurface storm runoff from seeps that emerge from the
   vadose zone following storms.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions of the energy and moisture transfer processes at the land
   surface are investigated using factorial experimentation on a simple
   non-vegetated model. The model is constructed from energy and moisture
   balance equations at the land surface. Parameterizations from general
   circulation models are used to describe the model components. The
   factorial analysis is performed on two differently parameterized
   versions of the model in both steady-state and dynamic models. Results
   indicate that the runoff parameterization plays a critical role in
   determining soil moisture. Also, the inclusion of a second soil layer
   appears to have an attenuating effect on the model's temperature and
   soil moisture response times, whereas the choice of top layer depth
   substantially affects the diurnal surface temperature variation. It is
   also found that the temperature response time is correlated with and a
   strong function of the moisture response time. These results are useful
   in understanding the variation in regional climate predictions
   documented in recent general circulation model studies. In addition,
   factorial designs are shown to be an effective tool for analyzing
   individual parameter sensitivity and parameter interaction in models
   with a large number of factors.}},

Abstract = {{The NELUP Nitrogen Modelling System (NMS) has been developed to model
   the transport of nitrates within large catchments. It is one component
   of a suite of hydrological models that have been integrated with
   ecological and agroeconomic models in a Decision Support System. The NMS
   has been designed to be applied in four stages: determination of
   nitrogen input categories; simulation of plant uptake and decay using
   the farm management model EPIC; simulation of initial nitrate profiles
   in the unsaturated zone with the one-dimensional transport model (MP);
   and finally a simulation of nitrate transport using the SHETRAN-UK
   catchment flow and transport modelling system.
   The NMS has been applied to model the transport of nitrate within the
   3000 km(2) Tyne basin for the period 1985-1989. Predicted in-stream
   nitrate concentrations throughout the catchment display a low base
   concentration with peaks corresponding to overland flow events following
   fertiliser application. Model results compare favourably with the
   available monthly NRA nitrate observation data at a number of different
   locations within the catchment. A short field study has been undertaken
   within the Tyne which demonstrates the occurrence of the transport of
   nitrate within overland flow events, a hitherto undocumented process.}},

Abstract = {{CHUM (CHemistry of the Uplands Model) simulates soil-water chemical
   interactions and water flows in upland catchments with acid soils. The
   chemical interactions are described with the equilibrium speciation code
   WHAM, which emphasises the interactions of inorganic chemical species
   with solid-phase and dissolved organic matter, and also considers
   inorganic solution speciation and sorption reactions of fulvic acid. Of
   special significance is the treatment of aluminium chemistry; control of
   dissolved aluminium concentrations is assumed to be due primarily to
   complexation reactions with solid phase organic matter, whereas previous
   models have postulated equilibrium with mineral phases or simple
   ion-exchange. In addition, CHUM takes nitrogen transformations and
   weathering (dissolution) reactions into account. The catchment is
   conceptualised as a series of columns consisting of two soil horizons
   and an underlying permeable or fractured bedrock zone. Water flows are
   described with a hydrological submodel that distinguishes immobile water
   present in soil micropores (which is in chemical equilibrium with the
   soil solids) from mobile drainage water. The mobile water can move
   vertically from one horizon to another, from one column to the column
   immediately downslope, or as outflow from a column adjacent to a stream
   or lake. Solutes exchange between the mobile and immobile compartments.
   The model runs on a daily time-step. The fundamentals of the model are
   given, together with a description of its application to a site in the
   English Lake District.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrograph analysis techniques have been well developed for hydrographs
   obtained from streams and springs, where data are cast in terms of total
   discharge. The data obtained from well hydrographs provide water level
   versus time; hence, a method of hydrograph analysis is required for
   situations in which only water level data are available. It is assumed
   here that three segments on a recession curve from wells in a karst
   aquifer represent drainage from three types of storage: conduit (C),
   fracture (F) and matrix (M).
   Hydrographs from several wells in a karst aquifer are used to estimate
   the specific yields (S-y) associated with each portion of the aquifer
   (C, F, M), as well as continuum transmissivities (T). Data from three
   short injection tests at one well indicate continuum rat this well bore
   is approximately 5 m(2) day(-1), and tests at numerous other wells in
   the aquifer yield results between 1 and 7 m(2) day(-1). The T estimated
   with well hydrographs from two storms indicates a T of 9.8 m(2) day(-1).
   Well-developed conduit systems in which water levels in wells show a
   flashy response typically show S(y)s of 1 x 10(-4), 1 x 10(-3), and 3 x
   10(-3) for C, F, and M, respectively. Less well-developed conduit areas
   show more nearly equal S(y)s (8.6 x 10(-4), 1.3 x 10(-3), 3 x 10(-3)).
   Areas with no evidence for the presence of conduits have only one, or in
   some cases two, slopes on the recession curve. In these cases,
   water-level responses are slow. Recession curves with a single slope
   represent drainage from only the lower T matrix. Those with two slopes
   have an additional, more rapid response segment on the recession curve
   which represents drainage from the higher T, lower S-y, fractures in the
   system.}},

   non-monsoon estimates. The data used by the model were the geometry of
   the aquifer system, the aquifer parameters, and historical water table
   elevations. The methodology is unique in that it gives information on
   temporal and areal recharge variations, and requires fewer data than the
   traditional water-balance method. The maximum average net recharge to
   the aquifer was calculated as 0.6 mm day(-1) during monsoon 1986; the
   corresponding monsoon rainfall had a return period of some 2.8 years.}},

Title = {{The effects of pulsed pumping on land subsidence in the Santa Clara

Pages = {{375-396}},

Abstract = {{Land subsidence caused by pulsed and constant pumping schemes was
   calculated, and the results were compared to determine the possible
   advantages of pulsed pumping in reducing land subsidence. Pulsed pumping
   refers to pumping strategies involving alternation between periods of
   pumping and recovery in a well. Subsidence was calculated using a
   numerical model based on the Santa Clara Valley, CA. The model accounts
   for delay in the release of water from storage in compressible interbeds
   as well as flow within aquifers. For these tests, the ratio of pumping
   period length to recovery period length was either 1/1 or 1/3. Pulsing
   interval length (length of one pumping period plus one recovery period)
   ranged from 4 to 90 days. Pumping rates were adjusted so that pulsed
   pumping and constant pumping removed the same volume of water over the
   period under consideration.
   Pulsed pumping has the potential to `concentrate' subsidence around the
   pumping well. For all simulations, pulsed pumping caused greater
   subsidence near the test well than constant pumping. Under some
   conditions a transition point was reached, beyond which pulsed pumping
   caused less subsidence than steady pumping. The distance from the test
   well to the transition point decreases for (a) decreasing aquifer
   transmissivity, (b) decreasing ratio of pumping period to recovery
   period, and (c) increasing pulsing interval length. The concentration of
   subsidence was reduced considerably when delay in release of water from
   storage in compressible aquitards was neglected, indicating the
   importance of including delay effects in subsidence studies. All pulsed
   pumping strategies caused a greater total volume of subsidence than
   steady pumping.}},

Abstract = {{The main processes that govern the behaviour of the industrial compounds

   The water quality model WASP is applied to simulate the present spatial
   distribution of 12 selected PCB isomers. The simulations are performed
   under average hydrodynamic and suspended sediment transport regimes.
   Calculated evolution profiles of the dissolved and sorbed concentrations
   in the water column indicate a high accumulation of the PCB in the zone
   of the turbidity maximum. The simulated distributions of the sorbed PCB,
   suspended sediment and salinity in the water column agree with the
   observations, but more measurements are needed in order to verify the

Abstract = {{This paper reports the evaluation of three geostatistical interpolation
   methods (ordinary kriging, cokriging and modified residual kriging) to
   interpolate long-term mean total annual reference evapotranspiration
   (AETO) and long-term mean total annual precipitation (APRE) in a
   mountainous region, where the stationarity hypothesis probably do not
   hold for the whole region, but do hold locally. AETO and APRE estimates
   and estimation errors were evaluated at validation stations. Estimates
   and computed estimation error variances (used as indicators of
   estimation uncertainty) were also obtained at 1913 5 km grid points. In
   general, estimates at validation stations were in good agreement with
   observed values for all interpolation methods, although modified
   residual kriging estimates of APRE were slightly worse than those
   obtained by the other two methods. Based on mean absolute error (MAE)
   and mean squared error (MSE) at validation stations, no method ranked
   clearly above other for interpolation of AETO. At grid points, AETO
   estimation uncertainty was improved by cokriging by about 11.5\% and
   8.4\% compared with ordinary kriging and modified residual kriging,
   respectively. Likewise, cokriging was superior for interpolation of APRE
   in terms of MAE and MSE obtained at validation stations, At grid points,
   cokriging reduced estimation uncertainty by 18.7\% and 24.3\% compared
   with ordinary kriging and modified residual kriging, respectively,
   whereas modified residual kriging in general did not improve ordinary
   kriging results. Computed estimation error variance values indicated
   that modified residual kriging would reduce estimation uncertainty in
   areas where very few weather stations are available for interpolation.}},

Abstract = {{The storm precipitation in a mountainous watershed in the southwestern
   British Columbia has been studied. The 175 storms analyzed have been
   classified into winter rainfalls, snowstorms, summer rainfalls, and
   storms that produce a mixture of rain and snow. Analysis of the spatial
   distribution of the storm features showed that the precipitation always
   increases up to the mid-distance of the watershed, and may then decrease
   and/or level off or increase with elevation again, depending on the type
   of event. This storm distribution is similar to the distribution that
   has been found for the long-term precipitation in the study watershed.
   Examination of the time distribution of the storms indicates that the
   precipitation distribution in time is not affected by the elevation,
   type of storm, storm duration, or storm precipitation depth.
   Furthermore, the transferability of the storm time distribution has been
   examined by comparing the time distribution of storms observed in the
   study watershed to the storm time distribution at three other coastal
   British Columbia stations. Finally, three severe storms that caused
   floods in the study area have been analyzed and it has been shown that
   their spatial and temporal distribution is similar to the results found
   from the analysis of the 175 storms. These results, along with the
   finding of the study that the antecedent precipitation is usually large,
   can result in better estimation of the runoff from the mountains of the
   area.}},

Abstract = {{A generalized three-dimensional analytical solute transport model with a
   unidirectional flow held from time- and space-dependent rectangular
   sources in a bounded homogeneous medium is presented using the
   first-type (or Dirichlet) source condition at the inlet location of the
   medium. The partial differential equation for solute transport
   incorporates terms accounting for advection (or convection), mechanical
   dispersion, molecular diffusion, linear equilibrium sorption, and
   first-order decay. Fairly general solutions are presented under
   unsteady-state and steady-state solute transport conditions for
   arbitrary source input conditions with the help of Fourier analysis and
   Laplace transform techniques. Special solutions are given for a single
   source and two rectangular sources with constant source concentrations.
   It is shown that some one- and two-dimensional analytical solute
   transport models published in the literature are exact special cases of
   the general three-dimensional analytical model. The numerical results of
   the one rectangular source model are also compared with the results of
   the model of Huyakorn et al. (1987), with good agreement. The solutions
   may be used for predicting solute concentrations from partially
   penetrated solute sources located at any place along a vertical plane
   perpendicular to the flow direction of groundwater, rivers, and canals.
   The solutions may also be used for verification of more comprehensive
   numerical models, and laboratory and field determination of solute
   transport parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Starting with a review of the basic processes that govern greenhouse
   warming, we have demonstrated that the hydrologic cycle plays a key role
   in the heat balance of the Earth's surface-atmosphere system. Through
   the water and other climatic feedbacks, the hydrologic cycle is shown to
   be a key factor in the climate's evolution as greenhouse gases continue
   to build up in the atmosphere. This paper examines the current
   predictive capability of general circulation models linked with
   macroscale and landscape-scale hydrologic models that simulate regional
   and local hydrologic regimes under global warming scenarios, Issues
   concerning hydrologic model calibration and validation in the context of
   climate change are addressed herein, It is shown that the natural
   uncertainty in hydrologic regimes in the present climate introduces a
   signal-to-noise interpretation problem for discerning greenhouse-induced
   variations in regional hydrologic regimes. Simulations of river basins
   by means of macroscale hydrologic models nested within general
   circulation models have been implemented in a few selected cases. From
   the perspective of water resources management, such simulations, carried
   out in detail under greenhouse-warming scenarios in midlatitudinal
   basins of the United States, predict shorter winter seasons, larger
   winter floods, drier and more frequent summer weather, and overall
   enhanced and protracted hydrologic variability.
   All these predictions point to potentially worsening conditions for
   flood control, water storage, and water supply in areas of semiarid
   midlatitudinal climates currently dependent of spring snowmelt. Little
   information of this type is currently available for other areas of the
   world. Practice of sound water resources engineering principles ought to
   be adequate to cope with additional hydrologic uncertainty that might
   arise from global warming.}},

Abstract = {{New measurements of field saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil
   moisture, rain intensity, surface runoff and erosion are presented with
   earlier published data on soil physical properties, stream water quality
   and runoff and dissolved nutrient losses from a paired catchment
   experiment in Sabah, Malaysia.
   The catchment experiment compared crawler tractor extraction and burning
   (normal practice, catchment W5) versus manual extraction and no burning
   (W4). Another catchment where secondary vegetation after forest fire was
   cleared and burned before planting was also studied (W1 + 2), Two
   separate control catchments were also included; one was for rainforest
   (W6) and the other comprised secondary vegetation (W3).
   Although hydraulic conductivity was reduced in clay soils at 20 and 40
   cm depths under tractor tracks, the decrease was less drastic than for
   steady-state infiltrability on both clay and sand topsoils, since
   control topsoils (0-20 cm) were well aggregated in contrast to more
   compact subsoils with higher clay content. Topsoils were close to
   saturation at all times, also after treatments, but control forest
   surface runoff in slopes (excluding valley bottom) comprised only 2.9\%
   of rainfall in a wet year. Except for just after burning, clear-felling
   did not increase slope surface runoff on undisturbed clay topsoils, and
   surface erosion was not increased, except for the erosion of ash after
   burning. On tractor tracks, extensive surface runoff caused surface and
   gully erosion. Elevated concentrations of suspended sediment in
   stormflow in W5 were back to pretreatment levels within 2 years. Under
   manual extraction suspended particulate loss was approximately half,
   most of which emanated from sediments activated by increasing stream
   runoff.
   Dissolved nutrient losses from catchment W5 in kilograms per hectare
   were 39.9 (N), 1.3 (P), 189 (K), 27 (Ca) and 16 (Mg) in the 33 months
   during and after treatments; these amounts were equivalent to between 10
   and 185\% of the removal in the harvest. For the `minimum disturbance'
   of W4, the increased nutrient loss was halved, except for Ca. Burning of
   residues in W1 + 2 and W5 increased dissolved losses dramatically over a
   short period.}},

Abstract = {{The estimation of well catchments in uniform background flow is usually
   made by means of models that rely on the assumption of homogeneous and
   isotropic conductivity fields. Properties of natural systems may vary
   significantly and in a very complex manner in space. One
   conceptualisation that takes into account this variability in hydraulic
   conductivity is based on the theory of random space functions. The
   effect of this randomness is that the influence of a discharge well
   cannot be delineated without some degree of uncertainty. This
   uncertainty needs to be considered when areas of contribution to wells
   under field conditions are to be defined. In this work, the problem is
   tackled by dimensional analysis and the solution is numerically treated
   within a stochastic approach. A steady 2-D non-uniform groundwater flow
   is considered in a statistically isotropic field of hydraulic
   conductivity K(x), with a single production well and a uniform base
   gradient. The analysis is performed via a Monte Carlo procedure that
   involves the generation of a great number of realisations of a given Y'
   = In(K/K-G) field, normally distributed, with zero mean, sigma(Y)(2)
   variance and simple exponential correlation. Various degrees of domain
   heterogeneity, i.e. sigma(Y)(2), are considered. The probability P-1
   that an ideal solute pulse released in a given location in the aquifer
   reaches the well is, identified, and conceptually consistent equations
   of practical use for engineering purposes are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrosalinity evolution is examined in the Karaikal and Tanjavur coastal
   aquifers situated about 300 km south of Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.
   Ancient and modern sources of solutes in groundwaters have been
   differentiated using hydro-geochemical data, environmental radioisotope
   dates and organic biomarkers. Results from different techniques show
   consistently that the Pliocene aquifer possesses characteristic
   palmitoleic and oleic acid biomarkers, C-14 ages of more than 20 000
   years and high I/Cl ratio; the modern marine-estuarine apparent intruded
   groundwaters in the alluvial aquifer display relatively younger apparent
   C-14 ages (modern to 3000 years), enriched potassium ion, low I/Cl ratio
   and contain vaccenic and hopanoic acid biomarkers, and they also tend to
   display transient changes in chemical characteristics. These results
   have practical importance with regard to identifying and controlling
   seawater intrusion in coastal areas.}},

Title = {{TOWARDS A CONTINUOUS OPERATIONAL SYSTEM TO ESTIMATE THE ROOT-ZONE

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{173}},

Abstract = {{A study has been carried out to develop and evaluate a system to
   estimate soil moisture content in the root-zone using active microwaves
   from the European Remote Sensing Satellite, ERS-1, to measure moisture
   content in the top 10 cm of the soil profile. Two permanent grass sites
   in the UK with contrasting soil types, clayey and sandy, were selected
   for this study. The system consists of an initialization phase, which
   provides surface and root-zone moisture contents as initial values for
   the dynamic phase of a soil water balance model. The initial value of
   surface moisture can be either a remotely sensed or a measured value.
   The surface moisture value for a given day is in turn used to derive the
   initial value of the root-zone moisture for the same day. This can be
   obtained either from an empirical relationship for drying or wetting
   conditions, or during drying conditions alone. Both types of
   relationship have been established for each of the sites, with strong
   coefficient of determination, R(2). The two-layer soil dynamic model
   requires as input daily rainfall, evapotranspiration and three soil
   physical parameters-soil moisture at held capacity, wilting point and a
   pseudo-diffusivity coefficient. The first layer represents the remotely
   sensed layer, taken as 0-10 cm, and the second represents the root-zone,
   taken as 0-50 cm, for both sites. The model has been run for 1992 and
   1993. The model was not initialized by remote sensing data owing to an
   insufficient number of microwave backscatter-surface moisture data pairs
   to produce a relationship with good R(2). It is hoped that the
   continuing collection of data will improve the relationships. Initial
   soil moisture contents of both layers were considered to be at field
   capacity, which is usually the case during winter time. The dynamic
   model, which offers a good balance between accurate description of the
   processes and minimum input of data, proved capable of simulating both
   surface and root-zone moisture content. Despite the fact that the two
   phases of the system have been tested using ground-truth measurements,
   it has the potential to produce continuous surface and root-zone
   moisture contents using intermittent remotely sensed surface moisture to
   initialize or update the model. Therefore, further tests with remote
   sensing data and entirely independent soil moisture data sets (under
   collection) are still required. At present, the system has been tested
   on two soil types and one vegetation cover, namely permanent grass. For
   a wider use of the system at a regional scale, further developments are
   planned to account for more soil types and land covers.}},

Abstract = {{A conceptual model of a catchment's annual water balance is developed.
   The model is based on the sequential separation of annual precipitation
   into surface runoff and wetting, and wetting into baseflow and
   vaporization. The separation is based on a proportional relation linking
   the three variables involved at each step. The generic form of the
   proportional relation is (X - lambda Z(p) - Y)/{[}(1 - lambda)Z(p)] =
   Y/(X - lambda Z(p)), in which X is an independent variable, Y is a
   dependent variable, X is the initial abstraction coefficient, and Z(p)
   is the potential value of the difference Z = X - Y. Given a set of model
   parameters, the method can be used to separate annual precipitation into
   its three major components: surface runoff, baseflow, and vaporization.
   Initial application of the method to literature catchment data provided
   encouraging results. The method can be used for estimates of the annual
   water yield throughout the climatic spectrum. The model parameters can
   be estimated from past experience or calibrated using measured data.}},

Abstract = {{A conceptual model of catchment water balance developed in the companion
   paper (Ponce and Shetty, J. Hydrol., 173: 27-40, 1995) is used to
   simulate changes in runoff and baseflow with annual precipitation. The
   model is based on the sequential separation of annual precipitation into
   surface runoff and wetting, and wetting into baseflow and vaporization.
   Runoff is the sum of surface runoff and baseflow. Runoff gain is defined
   as the derivative of runoff coefficient with respect to precipitation.
   Baseflow gain is defined as the derivative of baseflow coefficient with
   respect to precipitation. Catchment data show that runoff and baseflow
   gains are always positive. Runoff gain reaches a peak value at a
   threshold precipitation P-rt; baseflow gain reaches a peak value at a
   threshold precipitation P-ut. Analysis of the runoff and baseflow
   functions sheds additional light on the nature of the competition
   between runoff and vaporization, and baseflow and vaporization.}},

Abstract = {{Methane is one of the major carbon pools in the groundwater of the
   confined Alliston Aquifer. Geochemical, geological and hydrological
   tools were used to evaluate the origin and distribution of this

   thermocatalytic methane from bedrock units and in situ production by
   bacteria-mediated reactions. The distribution of methane in the aquifer
   excludes the possibility that methane occurrences were controlled by the
   nature of the underlying bedrock (limestone vs. shale). C-13 and H-2
   data in CH4 from aquifer and bedrock wells indicate that these gases are
   microbial in origin and they are formed in situ, mainly by CO2
   reduction. Chemical and C-14 data in CH4 and DOC support the hypothesis
   of the existence of carbon sources for in situ microbial production of

Abstract = {{Determination of homogeneous flood frequency regions is a necessary step
   in non-Bayesian flood regionalization procedures. A homogeneous region
   is defined as a group of drainage basins whose standardized hood
   frequency curves are similar, to within a certain margin of sampling
   error. An alternative to using homogeneous regions is to define a
   hydrological neighborhood, or region of influence, for each of the
   drainage basins. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying the
   hydrological neighborhood of a drainage basin based on canonical
   correlation analysis. Under the normality assumption, the proposed
   technique leads to the identification of a neighborhood having an
   ellipsoidal contour in a space of canonical variables. A data set
   consisting of 55 catchments from the Province of Quebec (Canada) and the
   jack-knife sampling procedure are used to assess the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Daily rainfall from two sites in central and southern England was
   stratified according to the presence or absence of weather fronts and
   then cross-tabulated with the prevailing Lamb Weather Type (LWT). A
   semi-Markov chain model was developed for simulating daily sequences of
   LWTs from matrices of transition probabilities between weather types for
   the British Isles 1970-1990. Daily and annual rainfall distributions
   were then simulated from-the prevailing LWTs using historic conditional
   probabilities for precipitation occurrence and frontal frequencies. When
   compared with a conventional rainfall generator the frontal model
   produced improved estimates of the, overall size distribution of daily
   rainfall amounts and in particular the incidence of low-frequency
   high-magnitude totals. Further research is required to establish the
   contribution of individual frontal sub-classes to daily rainfall totals
   and of long-term fluctuations in frontal frequencies to conditional

Abstract = {{A regional frequency analysis of annual maximum streaflow drought was
   presented as a method for investigating the spatial and temporal
   variability of droughts. Three geographical regions in New Zealand with
   different climate and physical properties were used in the study. The
   annual maximum droughts in terms of severity (total deficit) were
   identified for 44 sites with at least 20 years of daily flow data using
   two truncation levels: the mean and 75\% of the mean. For both
   approaches the mean of the standardised annual maximum severity was
   found to vary with physical and climatic catchment characteristics
   except for one region, where the severity was almost constant because of
   very high annual rainfall. The best regional estimates of mean severity
   were found for the lower truncation level. The severities and the
   durations of the annual maximum droughts at each site were almost
   linearly related. L moment statistics showed that two of the three
   regions were homogeneous, and that the three-parameter log-normal
   distribution gave the best fit to both severities and durations. A
   baseflow index integrating the influence of various physical and
   climatic catchment characteristics on hydrographs was found to be useful
   in regionalising the mean annual maximum severity and the log-normal
   distribution, allowing estimation of extreme droughts and droughts in
   ungauged catchments.}},

Abstract = {{To obtain remotely sensed synoptic measurements of surface water
   temperatures, use has been made of a Heimann Radiometer (Model KT79).
   This instrument, sensitive to thermal infrared radiation in the 8-14 mu
   m wavelength range of the electromagnetic spectrum is fitted with a
   telephoto lens and gives a restricted held of view at the water surface,
   enabling temperature estimation to +/-0.2 degrees C. For example, over a
   period of 1 h it was possible, from suitably selected vantage points, to
   record 475 point measurements of temperature over the entire surface of
   a reservoir some 1 km(2) in area (Embalse de Rioseco, northern Spain).
   Repeated sets of observations permitted the recognition of upwelling and
   sinking water masses. The technique enabled the detection of influx of
   cold water from springs along a geological fault zone in the Embalse de
   Tanes. Additionally, the inception and the temporal and spatial
   evolution of an influent plunging plume was monitored using this
   equipment. Although thermal radiometry is restricted to the measurement
   of surface water temperatures, its speed of data acquisition over a wide
   area should enhance appreciation of the thermal behaviour of lakes and
   provide an important complement to existing techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrological and chemical fluxes were examined for East and West Glacier
   Lakes and their adjacent high-elevation (3200-3700 m) catchments in the
   Snowy Range of southern Wyoming. Both lakes are approximately 3 ha, but
   the East Glacier catchment (29 ha) is about half the size of West
   Glacier. Bedrock is primarily quartzite that has been heavily fractured
   and crossed with mafic intrusions.
   Precipitation pH averages about 5.4-5.5, and weighted mean acid
   neutralizing capacities (ANC) of the discharge are about 50 mu equiv.
   l(-1) for East Glacier lake and 39 mu equiv.l(-1) for West Glacier,
   while the respective annual base cation removals are about 36 mequiv.
   m(-2) and 73 mequiv.m(-2). Two West Glacier tributary streams average
   less than 10 mu equiv.l(-1) ANC, but solute concentrations during the
   early snow melt are more than five times those found in midsummer. It is
   inferred that these early high concentrations primarily are due to early
   elution of solutes from the snowpack rather than the displacement of
   high-concentration groundwater, but the cations may be substantially
   affected by exchange reactions. Preliminary evaluation suggests that the
   mean ANC of both lakes would fall below zero if precipitation pH were to
   fall to 4.2-4.3. Episodic acidity during snowmelt and acidification of
   tributary streams would likely occur at a somewhat higher precipitation
   pH.}},

Abstract = {{In 1992-1993, temperature logs were used to study the movement of
   sewage-polluted surface water infiltrating into the fractured limestone
   of an experimental site located in the southeastern part of the Let
   Basin (Southern France). The wells investigated were located on either
   side of a sewage-polluted stream and intersected water-bearing fractures
   characterised by large contrasts in hydraulic conductivity. From the
   results of temperature-depth profiles measured in four closely spaced
   wells of 60 m depth (W7, W8, W10 and W16) during the period February
   1992-June 1993 and the findings of a previous and more extensive
   geothermal survey, we examined the spatial distribution and the temporal
   variability of ground-water temperature during periods influenced or not
   influenced by percolating sewage-polluted water. Results of this thermal
   survey, which were in good agreement with those of a physico-chemical
   and bacteriological survey simultaneously carried out at the site,
   provided a substantial amount of information on the distribution of
   contaminant how pathways. Well W8, which showed high fluctuating ground-
   water temperature anomalies, intersected a solution-enlarged part of a
   bedding joint which seemed to carry much of the sewage-polluted
   infiltrating water. Ground water in this conductive opening also had a
   low physico-chemical and bacteriological `stability' and the highest
   average contaminant concentrations. In contrast, Wells W10, W16 and, to
   a lesser extent, Well W7 displayed only low ground-water temperature
   anomalies during periods influenced by percolating sewage-polluted
   water. Ground water circulating through the thin and rather closed
   fissures intersected by these wells was less sensitive to pollution, as
   it had a greater thermal, physico-chemical and bacteriological
   `stability' and the lowest average contaminant concentrations. Thus, we
   suggest that in advance of more focused monitoring programmes,
   temperature-depth profiles in wells could effectively be used to
   describe the effect of the structural features of fractured limestone
   aquifers on the movement of infiltrating contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{Artesian systems, 1000-2000 m deep, occurring in the one and half
   million km(2) Great Artesian Basin (GAB), are described by most
   researchers as through-how aquifers that are recharged at eastern
   outcrops in the Great Dividing Range. A simplified mathematical model,
   assuming basin-wide through-how in two aquifers - of Jurassic and
   Cretaceous rocks, has been applied by previous researchers to calculate
   hydraulic travel limes. The latter were described as agreeing with
   groundwater ages of 10(5) to 10(6) years, computed from Cl-36 data
   (assuming part of the observed Cl-36 was atmospheric) and He-4 ages
   (assuming the bulk of observed He-4 diffused from the crust).
   An alternative conceptual model is discussed in this paper, suggesting
   that artesian wells, drilled into the deep Jurassic rocks of the GAB,
   are tapping stagnant aquifers that are hydraulically isolated from each
   other. The stagnant aquifers are envisaged as mega fluid inclusions,
   formed during the subsidence of the basin. The age of the water in the
   stagnant aquifers is expected to be high - between the age of the host
   rocks (connate water) and the age of the subsidence stage at which the
   aquifer was sealed off by covering sediments and burial to beneath the
   active base of drainage. Isotopic ages were calculated to be in this
   range of very old groundwaters: the chlorine-36 data were interpreted as
   being beyond the dating limit of this method (i.e. over one million
   years, suggesting that the bulk of the observed Cl-36 was produced in
   situ), and the He-4 ages were computed to be 5-10 million years or more
   (suggesting that all the He was produced in the aquifer rocks alone).
   The groundwater in the artesian systems is concealed and hence the
   through-flow and stagnant aquifer models are both based on
   interpretation of indirect observations. Mathematical modeling is not
   feasible either, as too many parameters pertaining to the number of
   distinct aquifers, their rock properties, and other components of the
   groundwater cycle are unknown. Hence, a phenomenological approach is
   adapted, and the through-flow and stagnant aquifer models are weighed up
   in the light of first principles of physics, geology, hydraulics,
   chemistry and isotopic compositions.}},

Abstract = {{The literature of groundwater hydrology deals almost exclusively with
   through-flow aquifers, i.e. bodies of permeable rocks that contain water
   in all their voids, and have active recharge, appreciable through-flow
   and adequate discharge. The present paper augments this picture by
   addressing groundwater systems with the likely occurrence of stagnant
   aquifers, i.e. bodies of permeable rocks that contain water in all their
   voids, but are sealed off from recharge and discharge, and thus have no
   water through-flow. A phenomenological approach, based on first
   principles of physics, geology, hydrology and chemistry, is applied in
   the present account because groundwater is a concealed fluid that can
   not be traced directly.
   Hydraulically isolated pressurized (artesian) aquifers are identified in
   continental rocks of the Hazeva Formation, Miocene, in the Hazeva area,
   within the Rift Valley. The different aquifers are defined by the
   properties of waters ascending in artesian wells, e.g. concentration of
   major ions, C-14-based water ages, isotopic composition, and hydraulic
   heads.
   The different pressurized aquifers are interpreted as hydraulically
   isolated stagnant aquifers because: (1) the continental host rocks
   reveal a high degree of facies changes, and permeable rocks occur in
   lenses of limited extension, alternating with impermeable rocks, (2) the
   present climate is extremely arid and no effective recharge is observed,
   (3) the groundwaters analyzed in the region contain no measurable
   tritium, and C-14 ages range from 1000 to more than 25 000 years, and
   (4) the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes indicate recharge occurred under
   different paleo-climates.
   According to the conceptual model suggested, the currently stagnant
   aquifers are fossil through-flow aquifers that have each been cut off
   from recharge by overlying impermeable sediments and their discharge
   stopped by burial beneath the active base of drainage. The artesian
   pressure is attributed to compaction by overlying rocks.
   The Hazeva trapped pressurized groundwater systems are of special
   interest as they are (1) young, i.e. 1000 to more than 25 000 years old,
   (2) shallow, i.e. 50-250 m deep, and (3) small - the aerial extension of
   individual groundwater traps being in the range of 10 to 10(2) km(2).
   The identification of stagnant pressurized groundwater systems warrants
   special attention because establishment of their existence opens new
   economic applications, possibly surpassing the importance of the
   traditional exploitation of self-flowing groundwater. The potential
   value stems from the basic properties of entrapment: (1) the isolation
   from any recharge and contact with the surface makes such systems immune
   to contamination, thus providing ideal water reservoirs for emergencies
   caused by pollution accidents, including nuclear disasters, and (2) the
   lack of discharge makes depressurized (exploited) stagnant groundwater
   systems potential repository sites for toxic and nuclear wastes, freed
   from the danger of uncontrollable hydrofracturing.}},

Abstract = {{Observation wells in the arid Ramon National Geological Park were
   monitored at three sites (C, T, and E), each with wells spaced tens of
   meters apart, the distances between the sites being 860-1060 m. The
   following characteristics were observed: (1) water level differences of
   up to a few meters occur between wells that are 20-60 m apart at each
   site, and level differences of over 10 m occur between wells at the
   three sites, (2) the water levels were steady over 2 years of
   monitoring, (3) Cl concentrations in the wells vary over three orders of
   magnitude: 0.4-1.8 g l(-1) in site C, 1.8-3.7 g l(-1) in site T, and
   2.5-13 g l(-1) in site E, (4) the relative abundance patterns of the
   dissolved ions vary remarkably along with the concentration variations,
   from water dominated by Ca and SO4 to water dominated by Na and Cl, (5)
   the chemical composition is steady in each well, as indicated by
   chemical analyses repeated over 6 years, and conductivity monitoring
   over 2 years. The observed significant and steady compositional
   differences are interpreted as indicating the existence of small-scale
   isolated aquifers, with no lateral flow between them in spite of the
   pronounced water level differences. Flow in fractures is ruled out
   because of the steady water levels and very slow water level recovery in
   pumped wells.
   Dating strongly confirmed the lack of flow in the investigated shallow
   system. A well situated in the flood plain of Nahal Ramon revealed a
   tritium concentration of 8 TU and C-14 concentration of 69 p.m.c. -
   indicating post-1954 water, but two wells outside the river bed
   contained no measurable tritium and C-14 values of 14 and 22 p.m.c. -
   indicating water ages in the order of 10 000 years. In 15 additional
   wells no measurable tritium was determined. Thus, a case of ancient
   groundwater trapped in shallow aquifers, and bounded by efficient
   hydraulic barriers, is demonstrated.
   The geological set up seemed rather homogeneous, with no clue to
   small-scale efficient hydrological barriers. Yet, a detailed geological
   study, conveyed in the light of the hydrochemical findings, revealed the
   existence of dykes and small-scale structural and lithological controls,
   coinciding with some of the hydraulic discontinuities defined by the
   water properties.}},

Abstract = {{For large-scale catchment hydrology, the crucial importance of a good
   estimate of spatial rainfall variability is generally admitted. However,
   the assumption of uniform rainfall is still applied for small areas,
   whether they are studied as individual catchments or represent an
   elementary area in a distributed model. To investigate the validity of
   this assumption, an experiment was conducted in a small catchment (4.4
   ha) in the semiarid USDA-ARS Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed.
   Measurements were made with recording and non-recording raingages as
   well as vectopluviometers for a range of events during the 1990 monsoon
   season (July-September). Geostatistical analysis of the data indicated
   the presence of first-order drift with corresponding rainfall gradients
   ranging from 0.28 to 2.48 mm per 100 m with an average of 1.2 mm per 100
   m. These gradients represent a 4-14\% variation of the mean rainfall
   depth over a 100 m distance. Giver: these observations, the assumption
   of spatial rainfall uniformity in this and similar convective
   environments at the small watershed scale of 5 ha appears to be invalid.}},

Abstract = {{Rainfall and wind data obtained from a dense raingage network on a 4.4
   ha semiarid catchment were used as input to a distributed
   rainfall-runoff model. It was shown that the wind direction and velocity
   have a relatively small impact on peak rate and runoff volume for this
   low relief watershed. However, even at this small scale, spatial
   variability of precipitation can translate into large variations in
   modeled runoff. When five model runs were conducted using input from one
   of five recording raingages, one at a time, the coefficient of variation
   for peak rate and runoff volume ranged from 9 to 76\%, and from 2 to
   65\%, respectively, over eight observed storm events. By using four well
   distributed gages the variations in modeled runoff volume approach the
   sampling resolution of the raingages as well as the estimated accuracy
   of runoff volume and peak rate observations. The results of this study
   indicate that if distributed catchment modeling is to be conducted at
   the 5 ha scale in an environment dominated by convective air-mass
   thunderstorm rainfall, knowledge of the spatial rainfall variability on
   the same scale is required. A single raingage with the standard uniform
   rainfall assumption can lead to large uncertainties in runoff
   estimation.}},

Abstract = {{A non-dimensional analysis is undertaken to study the
   rainfall-runoff-esosion process over steep slopes. This analysis leads
   to a reduction in the number of parameters required for modeling erosion
   by overland flow. Two important parameters are identified: the
   dimensionless erodibility sigma{*} denoting the average erodibility over
   the whole slope, and G which partitions the sediment transport dynamics
   into detachment, deposition and equilibrium regimes. Analytical
   solutions are presented for the non-dimensional equations. It is
   observed that G remains practically time-invariant but has a marked
   spatial variation along the slope. The dimensionless sediment discharge
   along the slope shows strong dependence on both sigma{*} and G. Some
   asymptotic results are also discussed along with practical applications
   of this work.}},

Abstract = {{Two mole and pipe drained fields (labelled A and B) of Tokomaru silt
   loam soil in New Zealand, each 1250 m(2) in area, were used in the
   experiment. For field A, sodium bromide was applied (200 kg Br ha(-1)),
   and nitrate was taken to be the indigenous solute. For field B, urea
   (120 kg N ha(-1)) was the applied solute, and chloride was the
   indigenous solute. Drainage from the mole and pipe systems was measured
   and sampled using V-notch weirs, with continuous flow recorders and
   proportional samplers. Measurements were made over one drainage season
   (June to August) and the drainage analysed for these solutes.
   The results showed that early in the drainage season the concentration
   of applied solute increased with increasing flow rate, while the
   indigenous solute concentration decreased with increasing flow rate,
   apparently due to preferential flow. However, over time, applied and
   indigenous solutes were depleted to such an extent that the chemographs
   of both solutes showed a similar form. The longer the time interval
   between the application of a solute (Br or urea) and a drainage event,
   the less clear was the distinction between an applied (introduced)
   solute and a resident (indigenous) solute.}},

Abstract = {{Ground water flow systems in the rugged central Wasatch Range, Utah,
   were investigated by solute and isotopic methods. Six types of ground
   water systems were identified on the basis of rock type and structure.
   The systems are broadly grouped into four categories: (1) granitic
   systems; (2) non-granitic systems: (a) unconsolidated alluvial systems,
   (b) consolidated sedimentary rock systems, and (c) fault controlled
   systems; (3) thermal systems; (4) mine drainage systems, These ground
   water systems have distinctive solute and isotopic chemistries, Based on
   an analysis of H-3 and C-14 data, all of the ground waters have a
   component of post-1952 recharge water, and most of the ground waters are
   composed almost entirely of post-1952 recharge water. A few of the
   ground water systems contain some water which is hundreds to perhaps
   thousands of years old. The delta(18)O and delta(2)H data plot on a
   local meteoric water line, and none of the data exhibit a positive
   delta(18)O shift. The absence of a positive delta(18)O shift suggests
   maximum aquifer temperatures are approximately 100 degrees C.
   Granitic terrains are dominated by fracture controlled, local ground
   water flow systems which respond rapidly to recharge events. The
   granitic ground water systems have estimated maximum circulation depths
   of about 160 m below land surface. All the alluvial, most of the
   consolidated sedimentary bedrock, and some of the fault controlled
   ground water systems are shallow circulating, local flow systems with
   short travel times. Ground water circulation of most of the local flow
   systems is within 200 m of land surface and is bedding plane controlled.
   Some of the consolidated bedrock and many of the fault controlled ground
   water systems are of the intermediate type and have circulation depths
   to 500 m. Four thermal ground water systems have been identified. The
   thermal systems are heated by the geothermal gradient and have not
   circulated deeper than 2-2.5 km. The thermal systems are of the
   intermediate and regional type.}},

Abstract = {{An inverse numerical model was developed for the interpretation of
   simple or multiple pumping tests in layered groundwater reservoirs. This
   model was obtained by the combination of a numerical model and a
   nonlinear regression analysis. The numerical model is an axisymmetric
   hybrid finite-difference finite-element model, In the nonlinear
   regression analysis the residuals are defined as the differences between
   the logarithms of the calculated and observed drawdowns, and the
   hydraulic parameters are estimated within log space. The inverse
   numerical model is validated using a hypothetical example. From the
   study of the factors which influence the hydraulic parameter estimates
   and their joint confidence region, the following conclusions can be
   drawn, Use of a simplified representation of the flow system in the
   inverse model can cause erroneous estimates. The closer the simulated
   flow approximates the actual how, the closer are the estimates.
   Hydraulic parameter estimates obtained by fitting data from a single
   observation well to type curves can result in very different values for
   the parameters if the actual flow is different from the model from which
   the type curves are derived, These different values are not due to the
   heterogeneity of the formation as is often concluded in many pumping
   test analyses. The number of parameters that can be reliably estimated
   decreases and the joint confidence region of the estimates enlarges when
   the relative error of the observed drawdowns increases, Increasing the
   duration of observations reduces the joint confidence region and
   increases the number of parameters that can be reliably estimated.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-layer, transient conductivity Green-Ampt infiltration model was
   evaluated and parameterised for a layered soil, using rainfall simulator
   data, The model simulates transient surface sealing and subsoil
   restrictions on infiltration under rainfall. Rainfall simulator plots (1
   m(2)) were run on four soil conditions/layers of a cultivated clay soil
   and infiltration parameters were derived for each layer: (a) surface
   (freshly tilled), (b) surface seal (pre-crusted), (c) tilled layer and
   (d) subsoil. For this soil, runoff was generated by restricted
   infiltration into the subsoil when surface sealing was prevented and by
   surface sealing alone when there was a crust created by prior rain (even
   though this crust was dried and cracked). For freshly tilled bare soil,
   surface sealing controlled initiation of surface pending and subsequent
   infiltration, but at longer times infiltration was controlled by the
   subsoil. For freshly tilled soil, a single, consistent set of parameters
   were obtained for the layered soil system. These parameters gave good
   predictions of infiltration curves for all plots, including calibration
   and independent test plots, for a range of tillage depth, antecedent
   moisture and rainfall intensity, Surface seals reformed rapidly on the
   pre-crusted plots; infiltration curves were predicted well using a
   constant low or rapidly declining conductivity. Further research is
   needed on crusts formed by prior rain and their effect on infiltration
   parameters, as such crusts are common on bare clay soils except
   immediately after tillage. A large number of rainfall simulator studies
   are conducted for a range of purposes. These data should not be ignored
   as a source of parameters for hydrologic modelling.}},

Abstract = {{The ANSWERS model, modified to include Green and Ampt infiltration, was
   tested using measured runoff from several tilled, black earth catchments
   on the eastern Darling Downs, Queensland. Rainfall and runoff data from
   rainfall simulator plots (1 m(2) and 88 m(2)), and three small
   catchments (0.07 ha, 0.2 ha and 3.2 ha) were used to test predictions of
   runoff. Important infiltration parameter values were determined from a
   separate set of 1 m(2) rainfall simulator plots. Other parameter values
   were measured directly or estimated from published sources. Measured
   runoff from the simulator plots and catchments was accurately predicted
   by the modified ANSWERS; a linear regression explained 93\% and 81\% of
   the variation between predicted and measured peak runoff rate and runoff
   volume, respectively. Runoff was accurately predicted with the modified
   ANSWERS, as processes controlling runoff from the catchments, including
   infiltration and routing of runoff, were realistically characterised.
   This allowed parameter values to be derived independently of runoff, and
   transported to different size catchments without distortion or
   optimisation.}},

Abstract = {{The relative cumulative frequency distribution of residence times F(T)
   is calculated for an entire groundwatershed under steady-state
   conditions and assuming Dupuit-Forchheimer flow. It appears that F(T) is
   always the same: F(T) = 1 - exp(-T/(\$) over bar T), provided that the
   aquifer recharge rate and (\$) over bar T are constant over the
   groundwatershed. (\$) over bar T is the weighted mean residence time for
   the groundwatershed and is defined at (\$) over bar T = nH/N, where n is
   the aquifer porosity, H is the saturated aquifer thickness, and N the
   areal recharge rate owing to precipitation. In such an idealized
   groundwatershed the function F(T) appears independent of the
   groundwatershed size, shape, and nature of the stream network. It is
   also independent of regional variations in the hydraulic conductivity,
   provided the aquifer is locally homogeneous. Under unconfined flow
   conditions, where H varies, the relative frequency distribution of the
   residence time does depend on all of these parameters, but may be
   approximated by F(T), as demonstrated for the case of a one-dimensional
   groundwatershed. The frequency distribution of the residence times,
   dF/dT, is the response curve for an instantaneous unit pulse of a
   conservative tracer, applied over the entire groundwatershed. The
   findings are of significance for studying the effects of non-point
   source pollution on the scale of one or more watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{A field-scale, natural gradient solute transport experiment conducted at
   a Newfoundland blanket bog resulted in an asymmetrical plume owing to
   solute retardation in the dual-porosity matrix, An order of magnitude
   decrease in hydraulic conductivity 10-20 m downslope of the spill caused
   the transport rate to decrease and lateral dispersion to increase. Most
   transport occurred near the watertable and the transport rate increased
   as the watertable rose. Hydraulic conductivity between a depth of 0 and
   0.2 m was 1.6 x 10(-2) m s(-1), whereas at a depth of 0.5 m it was 5-6
   orders of magnitude lower owing to greater compaction and humification
   of the peat with depth. At a depth of 0.4-0.45 m diffusion may have
   become the dominant transport mechanism. In spite of the retardation
   process, the solute front's rate of movement was relatively high, about
   2.3 m day(-1), owing to a combination of the high watertable during the
   study and a relatively steep hydraulic gradient of 0.055. Rain caused
   dilution and mixing of solute near the watertable, Evaporation did not
   have an appreciable effect on solute concentration, which is
   attributable to the high transport rate.}},

Abstract = {{The isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen have been used extensively as
   indicators of groundwater age (H-3) and paleotemperature of groundwater
   recharge (O-18/O-16, H-2/H-1); however, comparisons of values in
   groundwater with those in recent precipitation are few. This study
   describes and interprets the isotopic composition of precipitation in
   central Iowa for the year 1992. An unusually mild winter driven by
   south-westerly flow of the jet stream was followed by an unusually cool
   and predominantly dry summer that was caused by a persistent
   northwesterly flow in the upper atmosphere. Temperature was below normal
   (9.0 degrees C); precipitation was above normal (868.4 mm) and was
   mostly derived from a Gulf of Mexico moisture source. Fifty-one
   precipitation samples were collected from 37 events and analyzed for
   hydrogen and oxygen isotopes. Tritium activities ranged from 0 to 44
   tritium units (TU) and the weighted mean H-3 activity was 11.02 TU, a
   value consistent with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) data.
   Anomalously high H-3 activities suggested input of technogenic H-3.
   Weighted mean values of delta(18)O and delta(2)H were -8.02 parts per
   thousand and -53.62 parts per thousand, respectively, and the equation
   of the local Meteoric Water Line was delta(2)H = 7.266(18)O + 4.65.
   Weighted mean delta(18)O and delta(2)H values from the Gull-Pacific
   moisture source (-10.80 parts per thousand, -74.82 parts per thousand)
   were more depleted than those ascribed solely to a Gulf of Mexico
   moisture source (-7.24 parts per thousand, -47.39 parts per thousand).
   Seasonal differences in temperature primarily controlled these
   differences in isotopic composition.}},

Abstract = {{Water and snow samples were collected in May of 1990 and 1992 in
   headwater basins and along a longitudinal transect of the Urumqi River,
   located in northwestern China. Surface waters were dominated by Ca2+ and
   HCO3- at all sites. Maximum measured SO42- concentrations in surface
   waters were 550 mu eq L(-1), and were balanced by Ca2+ and HCO3-; pH was
   slightly alkaline at all locations, Several independent analyses each
   concluded that the solute composition of surface waters was dominated by
   dissolution of rocks with rapid weathering kinetics, such as calcite and
   dolomite, Preliminary analysis of stable sulfur ratios in headwater
   basins shows delta(34)S values of +6.8 for snow and +3.3 for surface
   waters. Changes in the delta(34)S value of surface waters with
   increasing basin area were variable, suggesting changes in the stable
   sulfur ratios of source materials. The large amounts of HCO3- and base
   cations at all sites indicates that the Urumqi River is not sensitive to
   acidification from atmospheric deposition.}},

Abstract = {{An algorithm for calculating the time to equilibrium of complex
   watersheds is developed for spatially varied watershed characteristics
   and excess rainfall intensity. The wave travel time through the flow
   path originating from the hydraulically most remote point in the basin
   essentially determines the equilibrium time of the system. The wave
   travel time is computed for two distinct phases: overland flow and
   channel flow. The hydraulically most remote point is stationary for all
   spatially uniform rainstorms but may vary for spatially distributed
   storms. The time to equilibrium varies inversely with rainfall intensity
   raised to the power 0.4. Using a raster-based approach, algorithms were
   developed to determine the distance-drainage area relationship and to
   perform the numerical integration of the time to equilibrium. Although
   approximate, the algorithm provides maps showing the isochromes of
   surface runoff and travel time to the outlet, along with time-area
   histograms for uniform or spatially distributed rainstorms. Isochrones
   determine the response time required for water, dilute suspensions and
   pollutants to reach the watershed outlet under complete equilibrium. The
   effects of infiltration in delaying the time to equilibrium are
   significant only when delta/K is large.}},

Abstract = {{Recently the National Weather Service has developed a geostatistical
   model to generate areal estimates of snow water equivalent (the water
   content of snowpack) in various river basins throughout the Western USA.
   The areal snow water equivalent estimates are used to update the
   hydrologic simulation models used to produce extended streamflow
   forecasts in the USA. Currently, when the snow water equivalent
   estimates are obtained, it is assumed that the ground-based and airborne
   data used in the spatial model are measured without error. In this
   research, we illustrate how to modify the spatial prediction model to
   account for measurement errors in the observed airborne and ground-based
   snow data, derive the expressions necessary to model the measurement
   errors, and illustrate the modeling techniques on data collected in the
   Upper Colorado River basin.}},

Abstract = {{Water contained in plant and soil samples dan be analysed for H-2 and
   O-18 content by direct equilibration while contained within the sample
   matrix. Methods for this are described and compared with the commonly
   used azeotropic distillation of samples before isotope analysis. For
   delta(18)O, direct equilibration with CO2 gives results in good
   agreement with azeotropic distillation, i.e. within 0.5 parts per
   thousand at natural abundance. Direct equilibration is a practical
   method for individual twig samples containing less than 0.5 ml of water,
   and offers significant operator time savings compared with azeotropic
   distillation. Batches of up to 100 samples can be prepared in less time
   than required for a single azeotropic distillation, and analysis by
   automated continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry after
   equilibration for 3 days again requires a minimum of operator time.
   Complete equilibration of plant water with H-2 for delta(2)H measurement
   occurs only after the plant material has been heated to 100 degrees C
   under vacuum. The method described here is barely precise enough for
   natural abundance measurements (delta(2)H +/- 15 parts per thousand) but
   is well suited to field tracer studies with deuterium oxide.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to show how accurate radar-estimated
   rainfall, with good temporal and spatial resolution, can be used for
   hydrological purposes. A recent methodological advance in rainfall
   measurement using conventional weather radars has made it possible to
   account for much of the variation between the precipitation radar echo
   intensity and rain intensity. A method known as the window probability
   matching method (WPMM) was applied to radar measurements over several
   catchment areas in central Israel. Comparison of daily raingauge
   measurements with radar rainfall estimates demonstrated good agreement.
   The standard error of radar-estimated rainfall was only 7\% for a storm
   with a total average accumulation of 328 mm. Several case studies are
   provided which demonstrate the advantage of having an accurate rain
   field for calculating excess rainfall for each of the area grid squares
   in the watershed. Storm excess rainfall for different time durations
   depends strongly not only on the area size, but also on the differences
   in the rainfall intensity sequences. Accurate radar rain fields can
   permit dynamic calculations to be made along the storm path.}},

Abstract = {{The Triassic Sherwood Sandstone Group is a major UK aquifer. In this
   study the groundwater geochemistry of a 60 km(2) area has been
   investigated to improve the understanding of the hydrogeology of the
   area and to determine the origin of groundwater. Archived analyses of
   groundwater samples were interpreted to determine the dominant
   geochemical processes and subsequently samples were taken from selected
   sites for stable and radio-isotope measurements.
   Near areas of direct recharge of the Sherwood Sandstone, groundwaters
   are unsaturated with respect to carbonate minerals. Sulphate and
   chloride are contributed to the groundwater in the Sherwood Sandstone
   from the overlying Quaternary glacial drift deposits and Mercia
   Mudstone. The groundwater chemistry and isotopes of sulphate indicate
   that the source of sulphate is gypsum in the Triassic sequence and the
   Triassic-derived glacial deposits. A significant proportion of the
   calcium in groundwater is shown to be exchanged for sodium in the
   aquifer matrix. However, in the more mineralised waters, carbonate
   minerals are precipitated because of contributions to the groundwater of
   calcium from dissolution of gypsum.
   Up piezometric gradient, groundwaters are modern and have relatively
   high C-14 and tritium contents. The oldest water which was sampled for
   C-14 is estimated to be about 4000 years older than the modern waters
   which were sampled from near recharge zones.
   The groundwater regime in the study area may be compared and contrasted
   with Triassic sandstone aquifers elsewhere in the UK. Incongruent
   carbonate dissolution occurs, as described in the Triassic of the East
   Midlands, the Lower Mersey Basin and southwest England. Exchange
   reactions are important in determining the groundwater chemistry as
   found elsewhere in the Triassic of northwest England, and in contrast to
   the East Midlands and southwest England.}},

Abstract = {{Infiltration is one of the processes of the hydrologic cycle that has
   been studied and reported very extensively. The various theories and
   models proposed for the description of this process are usually
   applicable to small plots, subjected to rainfall intensities that are
   higher than the infiltration capacity of the plots. The resulting
   equations are thus applicable only to infiltration at capacity rate. The
   model presented herein is not restricted to capacity infiltration only.
   It can be used for computing the variations in the infiltration capacity
   rate and the production of rainfall excess for any given rainfall
   hyetograph and a specified value of the initial moisture content of the
   upper soil layer. The model comprises two elements, a linear reservoir
   with a regulated inlet and a regulating element linked to the reservoir
   element by a feedback loop. The definition of the two elements requires
   three parameters. One is the minimum rate of infiltration capacity,
   f(e), obtained when the moisture contents of the upper soil layer is at
   its maximum value, S-m, which is the second parameter of the model. The
   third parameter is the initial infiltration capacity, f(o), when the
   soil moisture is completely depleted.}},

Abstract = {{A physically based model was developed for analyzing the movement of
   colloidal clay particles in laboratory soil columns. The physical
   mechanisms of detachment of particles from the soil matrix, their
   subsequent transportation in the pore water, and possible entrapment or
   clogging were included in the model. The performance of the model was
   evaluated by comparisons with laboratory experimental results, A
   sensitivity analysis was performed to reveal the relative importance of
   the parameters in prediction of colloidal particle concentrations and
   fluxes. Soils with greater initial porosity led to smaller effluent
   concentrations, but contributed to greater overall particle removal. An
   increase in soil detachability, a parameter which expresses the ease
   with which colloids are removed from parent soil matrix, caused greater
   removal to a point, Beyond a threshold value, the suspended load of
   colloids in pore suspension exceeds the carrying capacity of the flow
   causing deposition and concentration reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Active groundwater sampling techniques are methods where the aquifer is
   flushed by pumping. The methods developed and tested represent
   non-dedicated methods for use in existing water wells. This paper
   describes two different sampling techniques: the Separation Pumping
   Technique (SP) and the Packer Baffle System (PBS). The methodology and
   design of the two systems is presented and the operational application
   is demonstrated by examples from full-scale field experiments. The
   methods are validated and their sensitivity to the well construction and
   the hydrogeological environment is assessed based on numerical modelling
   and controlled laboratory experiments. Active groundwater sampling
   techniques can be used for remedial pumping optimization and in
   obtaining hydraulic data and represent a fast operational and reliable
   sampling tool, also under heterogeneous and low permeability conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A new concept of multiport sock samplers for open boreholes (uncased or
   screened) is developed and tested. The concept involves displacing the
   water column and sealing the borehole with a long, low-pressure packer,
   which can be of modular construction. Samples are brought to the surface
   by low-flow sampling pumps which can be located inside or outside the
   packer and are connected to individual ports situated at the borehole
   wall. Two different styles were designed, constructed and tested. The
   first was a partly disposable single packer system, the Multilevel
   Packer System (MLPS). The second, the Birmingham Modular Sampler (EMS)
   was designed to be reusable in alternative configurations. The two
   devices were developed through laboratory and field tests. A number of
   technical problems were experienced; these have led to revised designs,
   which are presented. The advantages and disadvantages of each system,
   and the concept of the multiport sock sampler are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Four novel sampling systems were tested for their ability to obtain
   level-representative groundwater samples from two gravel-packed
   boreholes in different hydrogeological settings at Skrydstrup (Denmark)
   and Torgau (Germany). Samples obtained with the novel devices were
   compared with those obtained from nearby permanent dedicated reference
   systems. Results obtained using the novel samplers vary from excellent
   agreement to no agreement. Numerical analysis was carried out in an
   attempt to understand the variation in the sampling results.
   Investigation showed that a single perfect sampler does not exist for
   these sites. Level-determined groundwater samples in gravel-packed wells
   can be obtained using active as well as multi-port sock samplers. The
   choice of the sampler depends mainly on the specific hydrogeological
   conditions, well completion, the type of pollution and the time
   available for sampling.}},

Abstract = {{Four novel sampling devices (two sock samplers and two active devices)
   were tested for their ability to obtain level-representative groundwater
   from a 90 m uncased borehole in a Permo-Triassic sandstone aquifier. The
   samples were compared with those taken from a nearby piezometer nest.
   The results from the open borehole were not consistent with those from
   the piezometers, particularly in the lower part of the aquifer. Field
   data and five-layer regional groundwater model were used in an attempt
   to understand the reasons for the variation between the results. A
   strong downward vertical head gradient caused how into the top of the
   borehole and out of the bottom, disturbing the natural chemical profile.
   This accounted for the difference in the results between the piezometer
   nest and the sampling devices in the lower part of the aquifer. Further
   modelling showed that unreasonably long periods of flushing would be
   required to flush the zone of mixed water and therefore obtain
   level-representative samples from the lower section of the borehole.
   Sock samplers, which rely on natural groundwater flow to flush the
   aquifer, would have to wait several years, and so could only be used as
   semi-permanent devices. A conventional double packer method would
   require about 2 weeks of continuous pumping, whereas separation pumping
   would require several months of purging, unless larger pumps were
   utilised.}},

Abstract = {{The estimation of hydraulic conductivity and concentration profiles is
   important for groundwater quality studies and for planning remediation
   action. A simple and economical way is to use existing wells, provided
   that appropriate sampling techniques are available. The reliability of
   some new techniques (Separation Pumping (SEP), Packer-Baffle Systems
   (PBS), Multi-Port Sock Sampler (MLPS or EMS)) is studied in this paper
   by using numerical models to simulate flow and mass transport to the
   sampling device. The results of testing the methods in different
   hydrogeological environments as well as in the laboratory were analysed
   in order to understand-from a hydraulic point of view-the reasons, why
   these techniques succeed or fail to give reliable results. Important
   factors influencing the flow and transport in the system are identified
   and discussed. The investigation showed that SEP which can be used to
   estimate hydraulic conductivity as well as concentration profiles, gives
   reliable results. In order to obtain reliable results by means of PBS
   the hydraulic conductivity must be known and the sampling rate must be
   adjusted to it. However, experience showed that further problems can
   arise in the field. Multi-Port Sock Samplers give reliable results if
   the concentration profile around the borehole is not disturbed owing to
   vertical how in the gravel pack or owing to the installation of the
   device.}},

Abstract = {{Level-determined samples of groundwater are increasingly important for
   hydrogeological studies. The techniques for collecting them range from
   the use of purpose drilled wells, sometimes with sophisticated dedicated
   multi-level samplers in them, to a variety of methods used in open
   wells. Open, often existing, wells are frequently used on cost grounds,
   but there are risks of obtaining poor and unrepresentative samples.
   Alternative approaches to level-determined sampling incorporate seven
   concepts: depth sampling; packer systems; individual wells; dedicated
   multi-level systems; separation pumping; baffle systems; multi-port sock
   samplers. These are outlined and evaluated in terms of the environment
   to be sampled, and the features and performance of the methods.
   Recommendations are offered to match methods to sampling problems.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolution of a solid phase in the unsaturated zone is usually assumed
   to be the main factor transforming the composition of atmospheric water
   to that of groundwater. However, the opposite mechanism, namely a
   precipitation of insoluble and slightly soluble salts from rain water
   penetrating the root zone, may predominate, especially in arid regions.
   Field study of pore fluids in the unsaturated zone was carried out in
   the southern Ukraine, where the climate is temperate continental. Pore
   fluid samples were taken from soils and loessial loams at different
   depths in boreholes of about 1 m diameter with insulated walls. The
   boreholes were drilled to groundwater levels situated in loess loams at
   depths of 10-24 m. The sampling was performed using vacuum lysimeters.
   In the upper 0.5-2.5 m well-washed layer the infiltrating water
   composition changed from a HCO3-SO4-Ca type water to a SO4-Na type, the
   latter corresponding to groundwater composition. The root zone acts as a
   geochemical barrier which retains the calcium predominating in rain and
   irrigation water, owing to calcite and gypsum precipitation. This
   precipitation is accompanied by HCO3 and SO4 removal from the pore
   fluids and by an increase in the total dissolved solids (TDS) as a
   result of evapotranspiration. The observed profiles of calcium
   concentration in pore fluids, the manifestations of alkalization and the
   calcite accumulation are explained by the precipitating action of the
   root zone,
   Similar patterns were found in loess-covered arid regions of southern
   Israel (the Negev) on the basis of reported data on the composition of
   rain water, saturated soil extracts and the phreatic groundwater in
   sediments of the Avedat Group.
   A simple steady-state model of the transformation of rainwater
   composition to groundwater composition was developed and applied. It is
   based on the exclusion of Ca-Mg carbonates and gypsum from rain water.
   Annual precipitation rates (6-13 g m(-2) year(-1)) and the composition
   of precipitated salts calculated for the Negev are in agreement with
   data reported in the literature.
   It is shown that carbonate and gypsum precipitation in the root zone may
   explain the change of the HCO3-Ca type of rain water to the SO4-Na or
   Cl-Na type of groundwater which is fed by it under different climatic
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The tipping bucket model, a computationally efficient scheme for
   simulating soil water transport which requires few input parameters,
   implicitly assumes that all water flow occurs through macropores. The
   model is limited in its elimination of both micropore flow and macropore
   flow with unsaturated micropores and its reliance on a fixed time step,
   normally taken to be daily. The reformulation of the tipping bucket
   model as a set of differential equations for macropore water and solute
   transport removes the above limitations. Previous work on simulation of
   water transport through oxisols using the Richards equation showed that
   an accurate fit to measured water contents could be obtained only by
   making the probably false assumption that the saturated water content is
   only 70\% of the total porosity. Combining the tipping bucket equation
   for macropore water transport with the Richards equation for micropore
   water transport produces an equally good fit to measured water contents
   under the more reasonable assumption that saturated water content is
   equal to total porosity. A critical assumption in the production of a
   good fit is that the saturated water content is scale-invariant, i.e.
   the macropore and micropore domains have the same saturated water
   content. The tipping bucket equations introduce two parameters that are
   difficult to estimate, the macropore drainage parameter and the mass
   transfer coefficient for drainage from macropores into micropores.
   However, for the particular data set studied in this paper, the above
   parameters are largely irrelevant as long as macropore water does not
   drain downwards through macropores faster than it drains into
   micropores, i.e. as long as the macropore and micropore domains are not
   decoupled.}},

Abstract = {{Land use change has a direct effect on hydrology through its link with
   the evapotranspiration regime. In a large river basin there may be
   considerable variation in both climate and land use across the region.
   The potential impact of these variations on the evapotranspiration
   regime is assessed for the Tyne Basin in NE England, using an approach
   of physically based modelling. Using a simple hill-slope model,
   predictions of evapotranspiration are made for various scenarios of land
   use and climate, representative of those found within the catchment. A
   catchment model is used to demonstrate how the variations in
   evapotranspiration might affect the hydrology of a region. Simulations
   are performed applying various land uses to one upland and one lowland
   sub-catchment of the Tyne Basin. Results from the simulations show that
   the same land use change may have a significant effect on the hydrology
   of the lowland subcatchment, but an insignificant effect on the
   hydrology of the upland sub-catchment. This highlights the importance of
   considering the physical attributes of a region in predicting the
   consequences of land use change.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental data on unsteady flows in a channel with flood plains
   obtained in a laboratory test facility are presented. Flood flow at the
   upstream end of the channel was produced by an electrically actuated
   butterfly valve in the supply pipe. Water level variations were recorded
   at nine stations along the channel using capacitance probes and a
   computerized data acquisition system. Tests were conducted for various
   initial conditions, and duration and peak of the flood wave. Complete
   data for two tests are presented which may be used to verify numerical
   models. A one-dimensional numerical model was developed to simulate
   flood flow. The model solves the St. Venant equations by using the
   Preissmann four-point implicit finite-difference scheme. The suitability
   of two procedures for approximating the channel cross-section is
   investigated: (1) the flow velocity over the flood plains is negligible,
   the flood plain acts as storage only and does not contribute to the
   momentum (the flood plains and the main channel are separated by a
   vertical line at their interface and the division line is not included
   in the wetted perimeter); (2) the entire channel section contributes to
   momentum flux, the entire channel section has uniform average flow
   velocity and the non-uniform velocity is taken into consideration by a
   momentum coefficient, Although comparisons between the computed and
   experimental results are satisfactory in both cases, Approximation (1)
   gives better results than Approximation (2).}},

Abstract = {{Relationships between runoff and water quality from the 1960s to the
   present time were studied in two adjacent, almost undisturbed forested
   catchments (Teeressuonoja, 0.69 km(2), and Yli-Knuutila, 0.07 km(2)) in
   southern Finland. The concentrations of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) in
   stream-water have clearly increased in both the catchments during the
   last 20-25 years. In Yli-Knuutila, the volume-weighted average
   concentration of NO3-N increased over twofold, from 580 mu g l(-1) in
   1969-1979 to 1350 mu g l(-1) in 1980-1990. In Teeressuonoja, the nitrate
   levels were lower but the increasing trend was comparable with that of
   Yli-Knuutila. The largest increase of concentrations of NO3-N occurred
   from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. The total nitrogen stream-water
   output of Yli-Knuutila increased almost threefold, from 1.1 kg N ha(-1)
   year(-1) in 1969-1979 to 2.9 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in 1980-1990. The
   average proportion of the NO3-N output of the total nitrogen output
   increased during the same period from 56\% to 68\%. The mean annual
   inorganic deposition of nitrogen increased from 6.2 kg ha(-1) year(-1)
   in 1971-1979 to 8.5 kg ha(-1) year(-1) in 1980-1990. Decreasing
   retention was reflected in the input-output budget of inorganic N at
   Yli-Knuutila; output divided by input increased from 12\% during the
   1970s to 24\% during the 1980s. Increased leaching in the Yli-Knuutila
   and Teeressuonoja catchment streams indicates the effects of increased
   nitrogen deposition. The increase in nitrate leaching in Yli-Knuutila,
   particularly during the summer months, provides evidence of nitrogen
   saturation and the inability of the biomass to utilize the N available,
   whereas increase during snowmelt and the autumn period indicates the
   impact of N deposition.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical profiles of H-2 O-18 and (HHO)-H-2 concentrations have yielded
   useful information on evaporation and infiltration processes in soils.
   However, in the field; quantitative interpretation of such profiles has
   been limited by the restrictions inherent in the quasi-steady-state and
   transient analytical models available to describe the physical
   processes. This study presents a flexible numerical model that simulates
   transient fluxes of heat, liquid water, water vapor, and isotopic
   species. The model can simulate both infiltration and evaporation under
   fluctuating meteorological conditions and thus should be useful in
   reproducing changes in field isotope profiles. A transition factor is
   introduced in the isotope transport equation. This factor combines
   hydrologic and isotopic parameters and changes slowly with depth in the
   soil profile but strongly in the evaporation zone, owing to the rapid
   change in the dominant phase of water from liquid to vapor. Using the
   transition factor in the isotope transport equation facilitates
   obtaining the typical shape of the isotope profile (bulge at the
   evaporation zone). This factor also facilitates producing broad isotope
   enrichment peaks that may be seen in very dry soils.}},

Abstract = {{A controlled field experiment was conducted to provide data for a
   one-dimensional numerical model for simulating transient water flow,
   isotope transport, and heat transfer in the unsaturated zone (ODWISH).
   The experiment consisted of allowing water to evaporate from
   homogeneously packed sand columns and periodically sampling to observe
   changes in the distributions of moisture, temperature, and oxygen-18
   enrichment. The peaks of the oxygen-18 distributions were used to
   determine the value of moisture content at liquid discontinuity, a
   parameter important for modeling water vapor flow. Modeling transient
   second-stage evaporation from soil necessitated implementing a retention
   relation Psi(theta) that is applicable for dry soils, above the
   evaporation front, where vapor flow is dominant. A retention model for
   dry soils was developed, connected to the Van Genuchten model and the
   resulting two-segment retention relation was implemented in the
   numerical model. The connection point for the retention relation is the
   moisture content at liquid discontinuity, which was also used in the
   numerical model to locate the evaporation front. Simulations showed that
   the ODWISH model reproduces reasonably well the experimental
   distributions of moisture content, isotopic enrichment, and temperature,
   and that the model accounts for the major processes involved in water
   movement in the shallow unsaturated zone and the associated isotope
   transport. The most significant discrepancies between the simulations
   and the experimental data can probably be attributed to inadequencies of
   the available two-segment Psi(theta) relationship over the wide range of
   pressure heads Psi encountered during the experiment. The ODWISH model
   was employed to test the sensitivity of the isotope profile development
   to diurnal variations in temperature and humidity. The results indicated
   that daily, or even weekly, averages are adequate for predicting isotope
   profile development.}},

Abstract = {{In order to understand the groundwater flow deep underground and its
   long term evolution in the future, it is necessary to develop a
   comprehensive hydrological evaluation system including in-situ
   investigation methodology, instrumentation for measurement and an
   assessment method such as numerical simulation. A hydrological
   evaluation system was developed and a project was planned to confirm the
   efficiency of the system. The project, named the Shaft Excavation Effect
   Project, in which a shaft 6 m in diameter and 150 m in depth was
   excavated and the system was applied to evaluate the shaft excavation
   effect on groundwater flow. The following results were obtained.
   1. The recharge rate from the unconsolidated formation into the rock
   mass underneath was calculated to be 0.57 mm day(-1).
   2. The hydrogeological model was classified into 12 groups according to
   the results from a geological survey, geophysical logging and in-situ
   hydraulic tests.
   3. The predictive simulation and the subsequent observation showed good
   agreement, namely:
   the area where pore water pressure was considerably influenced by the
   excavation was within a range of 100 m around the shaft;
   the inflow into the pre-existing shaft and the drift was not affected by
   the excavation of the new shaft.
   4. The efficiency of the hydrological evaluation system has been
   confirmed.}},

Abstract = {{Assessment of the quality of evapotranspiration data is essential if
   databases valid for modelling purposes are to be constructed. In this
   study a quality control technique was applied to test the validity of
   long-term evapotranspiration data. Approximately 53\% of daytime data
   proved to be reliable. Unreliable data are caused not only by weather
   conditions, such as unfavourable wind direction and rain events, but
   also by the condensation of water inside the air intake tubing and
   filters of the instruments. The Deardorff model was applied to calculate
   evapotranspiration. The appropriateness of the parametrization used to
   obtain the leaf area index and the stomatal resistance was evaluated for
   a barley field located in southern Finland. The equation of Noilhan and
   Planton to calculate r(s) proved to be the best. The discrepancies
   between the measurements and the modelled data were assessed by critical
   examination of the measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Surface water and groundwater are normally closely connected in areas
   with shallow aquifer systems. Stream systems can thus be considered as
   the outcrops of associated groundwater hows in areas with a shallow
   groundwater table and a previous subsurface. This situation prevails in
   sandy lowland areas where almost all rainfall percolates into the
   subsurface so that the surplus over evapotranspiration becomes part of a
   groundwater drainage system before it reappears at the surface in a
   stream. The stream network, being the interface with the groundwater
   system, must have the capacity to release the seasonally dependent
   precipitation surplus through the continuum of ground and surface
   waters. A river network therefore consists of a hierarchical system of
   different order and incision depth, of which the discharge-contributing
   component contracts and expands with the seasonal fluctuation in
   recharge and water table depth.
   Coupling the mathematical expressions for groundwater drainage and
   stream flow enables development of a conjunctive model which relates the
   properties of a seasonally contracting and expanding stream network and
   related groundwater level fluctuation to the seasonal rainfall character
   for given geological and geomorphological conditions. This model further
   allows for assessment of drainage network response to a changing
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Flow-stratified sampling is a new method for sampling water quality
   constituents such as suspended sediment to estimate loads. As with
   selection-at-list-time (SALT) and time-stratified sampling,
   flow-stratified sampling is a statistical method requiring random
   sampling, and yielding unbiased estimates of load and variance. It can
   be used to estimate event yields or to estimate mean concentrations in
   flow classes for detecting change over time or differences from water
   quality standards. Flow-stratified sampling is described and its
   variance compared with those of SALT and time-stratified sampling.
   Time-stratified sampling generally gives the smallest variance of the
   three methods for estimating storm yields. Flow-stratified sampling of
   individual storms may fail to produce estimates in some short-lived
   strata because they may have sample sizes of zero. SALT will tend to
   give small samples and relatively high variances for small storms. For
   longer and more complex hydrographs, having numerous peaks,
   flow-stratified sampling gives the lowest variance, and the SALT
   variance is lower than that of time-stratified sampling unless the
   sample size is very large. A desirable feature of flow-stratified
   sampling is that the variance can be reduced after sampling by splitting
   strata, particularly high flow strata that have been visited just once,
   and recalculating the total and variance. SALT has the potential to
   produce the lowest variance, but cannot be expected to do so with an
   auxiliary variable based on stage.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater chemical data from Birkenes, southern Norway, collected
   during the period October 1980 to November 1993, reveal intensifying
   acidification in the 1990s, as evidenced by decreases in pH,
   acid-neutralising capacity and alkalinity, and increases in
   hardness/alkalinity ratio, `acidification', nitrate, non-marine sulphate
   (SO4{*}), non-marine hardness (Ca{*} + Mg{*}) and dissolved aluminium.
   The whole monitoring period is characterised by slopes of four or more
   on a plot of (Ca{*} + Mg{*}) vs. alkalinity.
   Owing to its proximity to the sea, the Birkenes catchment receives
   seasalt-influenced precipitation, which results in episodic, natural
   acidification of the groundwater via cation exchange of marine Na+ with
   soil-bound H+ and/or Al3+. However, it is uncertain whether all of the
   recent groundwater acidification can be attributed to intensifying
   seasalt deposition alone: the steep slopes on the (Ca{*} + Mg{*}) vs.
   alkalinity plot and the increase in groundwater SO4{*} suggest that
   strong acids, of possible anthropogenic origin, may be involved.
   Additionally, seasalt deposition appears not to have increased during
   the 1990s: Cl- content in precipitation has not increased significantly
   and river water pH has not decreased significantly over the period
   1990-1993. The suggestion is made that the observed intensification in
   groundwater acidification at Birkenes partly results from the exhaustion
   or weakening of an acid buffering system caused by soil acidification,
   under persisting, even if abating, anthropogenic acid loading.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the depth of Lake Viljandi between 1940 and 1990 were
   simulated using a lake water and energy-balance model driven by standard
   monthly weather data. Catchment runoff was simulated using a
   one-dimensional hydrological model, with a two-layer soil, a
   single-layer snowpack, a simple representation of vegetation cover and
   similarly modest input requirements. Outflow was modelled as a function
   of lake level. The simulated record of lake level and outflow matched
   observations of lake-level variations (r = 0.78) and streamflow (r =
   0.87) well. The ability of the model to capture both intra- and
   inter-annual variations in the behaviour of a specific lake, despite the
   relatively simple input requirements, makes it extremely suitable for
   investigations of the impacts of climate change on lake water balance.}},

Abstract = {{Critical load calculations have suggested that groundwater at depth of
   2m in Sweden is very sensitive to acid load. As environmental isotope
   studies have shown that most of the runoff in streams has passed through
   the soil, there is a risk in the near future of accelerated
   acidification of surface waters.
   To assess the importance of the last soil horizon of contact before
   discharge, the upper 0-0.2m of soils in seven discharge zones were
   analysed for pools of base cations, acidity and base saturation. The
   sites were about 3-4m(2) in size and selected from two catchments
   exposed to different revels of acid deposition.
   The soils in the seven sites had high concentrations of exchangeable
   base cations and consequently high base saturation. The high correlation
   (r(2) = 0.74) between base saturation in the soils of the discharge
   zones and mean pH of the runoff waters suggested that the discharge zone
   is important for surface water acidification. The high pool of
   exchangeable base cations will buffer initially against the acid load.
   As the cation exchange capacity (meq dm(-3)) and base saturation were
   lower in the sites from the catchment receiving lower deposition, these
   streams may be more vulnerable to acidification in the near future. The
   high concentration of base cations in non-exchangeable fractions may
   also buffer against acidification as it is likely that some of these
   pools will become exchangeable with time.}},

Abstract = {{The results from two whole-catchment manipulation experiments in Norway
   are used to evaluate MAGIC (Model of Acidification of Groundwater In
   Catchments), a model of ecosystem biogeochemical response to acid
   deposition. MAGIC is an aggregated catchment-scale model of
   acidification that has been widely used in assessment activities in
   Europe and North America. The experiments involved artificial decrease
   (Reversing Acidification In Norway, RAIN) and increases (Humid Lake
   Acidification Experiment, HUMEX) in acidic deposition. Runoff from both
   sites is influenced by moderate levels of organic acids. At each site
   the model was calibrated to the control catchment and then applied to
   the manipulated catchments with only minor adjustments. The major
   responses in runoff chemistry to the manipulations were closely
   simulated by the model. Differences between simulated and observed
   volume-weighted annual average concentrations of all major ions were
   less than +/-6 mu equiv 1(-1) for the entire 4-8 year period of
   prediction. Trends in response to the manipulations were correctly
   simulated. Most of the residual error resulted from an inability of the
   model to reproduce the year-to-year variability (noise) around the
   trends. Although such model evaluations cannot `prove' the correctness
   of the model structure, good fits to experimental data increase
   confidence in model applications for assessment and management purposes.
   Evaluations of this sort can also identify aspects of the model that
   need further development. For MAGIC, these are primarily a need for
   improvement in the calibration of aluminium solubility and a better
   process basis for nitrogen dynamics.}},

   types-forest, agricultural land or water surface. Values of the model
   parameters for the forest and agricultural lands were obtained from
   experimental studies carried out in the dry zone of India. Estimates of
   average monthly potential evaporation, together with measurements of
   monthly rainfall, were used in the model to predict the monthly levels
   of Lake Malawi. These were compared with observed levels. From 1896 to
   1967 the major fluctuations in lake level, both seasonally and annually,
   are well described by this model (excepting the period from 1935 to
   1945, immediately following the time when there was no outflow from the
   lake) using a value of 64\% for the forest coverage of the catchment.
   The overall agreement between prediction and observation indicates that
   variations in rainfall alone, without changes in either evaporative
   demand or in the hydraulic regime of the lake, are sufficient to explain
   lake level changes. For the more recent period (1954-1994), model
   predictions of lake level which take into account a decrease in forest
   cover of 13\% over the period 1967-1990 (consistent with the actual
   decrease in forest cover for this period) agree well with observations
   both annually and seasonally. Without this decrease in forest cover, the
   model predicted that the lake level would have been about 1 m lower than
   that observed during the southern African drought of 1992. The model, in
   conjunction with real-time rainfall data obtained from land-based
   gauges, radar or satellite observations, can be used for real-time water
   resource management applications such as the operation of barrages
   regulating the flow from Lake Malawi or for the issuing of flood or
   drought warnings.}},

Abstract = {{Streamwater discharge and chemistry of two small catchments on Catoctin
   Mountain in north-central Maryland have been monitored since 1982.
   Repetitive seasonal cycles in streamwater chemistry have been observed
   each year, along with seasonal cycles in the volume of stream discharge
   and in groundwater levels. The hypothesis that the observed streamwater
   chemical cycles are related to seasonal changes in the hydrological flow
   paths that contribute to streamflow is examined using a combination of
   data on groundwater levels, shallow and deep groundwater chemistry,
   streamwater discharge, streamwater chemistry, soil-water. chemistry, and
   estimates of water residence times. The concentrations of constituents
   derived from rock weathering, particularly bicarbonate and silica,
   increase in streamwater during the summer when the water table is below
   the regolith-bedrock interface and stream discharge consists primarily
   of deep groundwater from the fractured-bedrock aquifer. Conversely, the
   concentrations in streamwater of atmospherically derived components,
   particularly sulfate, increase in winter when the water table is above
   the regolith-bedrock interface and stream discharge consists primarily
   of shallow groundwater from the regolith. Tritium and chlorofluorocarbon
   (CFC) measurements suggest that the groundwater in these systems is
   young, with a residence time of less than several years. The results of
   this study have implications for the design of large-scale water-quality
   monitoring programs.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrochemistry of stream water in an acidic afforested catchment in
   the Welsh uplands was monitored routinely between 1985 and 1990.
   Nineteen storm episodes were sampled intensively during this period.
   Although the general storm response of the stream can be characterised
   by increased concentrations of H+, Al and dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC), and a dilution of Ca and SiO2, the detailed hydrochemistry of
   individual acid episodes exhibited marked contrasts. The minimum pH
   reached during specific episodes ranged from 4.1 to 5.0, and peak
   dissolved Al concentrations varied from 9 to 44 mu mol 1(-1). The
   reasons for such differences in the hydrochemical response can be
   identified for each individual episode by examining the complex
   interactions between (1) the quantity and quality of event
   precipitation, (2) antecedent patterns of weather and atmospheric
   deposition and (3) the hydrological processes which dominate the storm
   runoff response. The dynamic nature of catchment hydrology was found to
   exert a particularly strong influence on the hydrochemistry of specific
   acid episodes.}},

   smaller than the correlation length of hydraulic head fluctuations

Abstract = {{An excellent tool for checking numerical models of unsaturated flow in
   groundwater is analytical solutions. However, because of the highly
   nonlinear nature of the governing partial differential equation, only a
   limited number of analytical solutions are available. This paper first
   gives some simple 1-D solutions. Next, by use of a transformation, the
   nonlinear partial differential equation is converted to a linear one for
   a specific form of the moisture content vs. pressure head and relative
   hydraulic conductivity vs. pressure head curves. This allows both 2-D
   and 3-D solutions to be derived, which is done in this paper. Finally,
   computations from a finite element computer program are compared with
   results from one of the analytical solutions to illustrate the use of
   the derived equations.}},

Abstract = {{The Penman-Monteith model is expressed in non-dimensional form. Scalings
   are selected such that the groups of dimensionless variables lie between
   minus one and plus one. The relative importance of each term in the
   equation is assessed from the size of the dimensionless parameters. In
   extreme cases where very large or very small values are found,
   asymptotic analysis allows equation simplification.
   Hourly field data from savannah vegetation and pine forest are applied
   to each model term in its new form. For pine forest, the equation
   describing evaporation rates can be reduced to a single term. Describing
   savannah evaporation, the aerodynamic conductance is modelled in two
   different ways and subsequent values of calibrated parameters within the
   bulk stomatal response function are found to be strongly dependent on
   this. The model dependence of such parameters is more easily understood
   with equations in normalised form.
   A sensitivity analysis of the Penman-Monteith model to all driving
   variables is performed for both savannah and pine forest data.}},

Abstract = {{Evaporation and infiltration were compared for tropical rainforest and
   pasture, near to Manaus, Brazil from October 1990 to February 1992 using
   measurements of soil water storage over a depth of 2 m. The soil is a
   clayey oxisol of low water available capacity. In both of the dry
   seasons studied, the maximum change in soil water storage in the forest
   was 154 mm and in the pasture it was 131 and 112 mm. Similar behaviour
   of the soil water reservoir below forest and pasture in the wet season
   implied that differences in evaporation and drainage were small. In the
   dry season, soil water storage behaviour in the upper metre of the soil
   was similar but there were marked differences in the second metre. The
   pasture took up little water from below 1.5 m but the forest appeared to
   utilise all of the available water in the 2 m profile in both seasons.
   The water balance of the 2 m profile showed that the pasture evaporation
   rate was equal to that of the forest until storage had decreased 80 mm
   from the maximum. There was then a decline in pasture evaporation rate
   to 1.2 mm day(-1) as the storage decreased by a further 50 mm. In
   contrast, the forest uptake rate remained above 3.5 mm day(-1) until
   storage had decreased 140 mm from the maximum (within 15 mm of the
   extraction limit), before declining abruptly to less than 1.5 mm
   day(-1). There was strong evidence that the forest was able to abstract
   water from depths greater than 3.6 m.
   Spatial variability of soil water storage was significantly greater
   beneath the pasture than beneath the forest, particularly following
   rainfall events in the dry season. This was largely the result of
   redistribution of rainfall as local surface runoff. There was no
   evidence of redistribution or runoff in the forest.}},

Abstract = {{In 1989, in a hydrological research programme within a deacidification
   project in the Gardsjon area in southwest Sweden, flow paths and
   residence times of soil water and groundwater in microcatchments were
   examined to support the interpretation of the hydrochemical changes.
   Saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention were analysed
   on more than 100 cylinder samples. The catchments have shallow
   sandy-silty till soil with a mean depth in the main catchment of 43 cm.
   Porosity of the mineral soil in the main catchment was high and ranged
   from 38 to 85\%. The samples from the B-horizon had generally higher
   porosity. Porosity and the content of organic matter were correlated.
   The soil water retention was relatively high at all tensions, likely
   owing to the high content of organic matter. Dissolved organic
   substances were most probably transported from the shallow soil on the
   steep sides of the catchment down to the valley where it precipitated.
   The high porosities could be a consequence of long-term weathering,
   provided that the organic substances present have increased the leaching
   of the weathering products. Measured values of saturated hydraulic
   conductivity were close to log-normally distributed with a mean for all
   samples of 3 x 10(-5) m s(-1). There was a significant increase in
   conductivity toward the ground surface with the mean conductivity of the
   samples in the uppermost 10 cm of the mineral soil of 4 x 10(-5) m
   s(-1), which was about 13 times higher than the conductivity of 3 x
   10(-6) m s(-1) at 1 m depth. From the relationship between runoff at the
   catchment outlet and groundwater levels, the conductivity was estimated
   to be 15-200 times higher in the upper soil layer than in the deeper
   ones. In one profile, 44-64\% of the yearly lateral flow was estimated
   to occur above 30 cm depth. The conductivity was correlated with the
   content of drainable water, which indicated the importance of the
   largest pores for the saturated hydraulic conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Among 24 monthly water balance models, one proved to be suitable for all
   75 Belgian basins studied. However, their respective parameter values
   proved to be significantly different. Each of these 75 basins in turn
   was considered ungauged and two techniques (kriging and the use of
   parameter values of a few neighbouring basins) were applied to compute
   their parameter values. Kriging gives good results in 72\% of the
   basins, whereas the second technique gives good results only in 44\%.
   Thus kriging is significantly better. Even if the requirements for
   `goodness' are relaxed, a limited number of basins are badly modelled
   even by kriging. This may be due to the intrinsic weakness of the
   technique, poor data quality, or lack of data.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix dynamically responds to
   changes in the surrounding environment. Therefore, infiltration
   parameters for the Green-Ampt equation should change for each storm
   event in continuous simulation models. This study focused on improving
   Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model estimates of runoff using
   over 220 plot-years of natural runoff plot data from 11 locations. By
   optimizing the effective Green-Ampt hydraulic conductivity, K-e, for
   each event within the simulation, a method of correlating hydraulic
   conductivity on any given day to many other parameters was established.
   Factors with significant correlation to optimized values of K-e fell
   into three distinct categories; (1) factors related to soil crusting and
   tillage; (2) factors related to event size; (3) factors related to
   antecedent moisture conditions. Equations were developed to represent
   the temporal variability of hydraulic conductivity for each group. The
   equation describing the decrease in hydraulic conductivity owing to
   crusting used an exponential decay function based primarily on
   cumulative rainfall kinetic energy since last tillage, a soil stability
   factor, and a crust factor. The relationship between hydraulic
   conductivity and event size was characterized using an exponential
   relationship with total rainfall kinetic energy. The final adjustment
   used the moisture content immediately below the infiltration zone to
   account for the influence of antecedent moisture conditions on optimized
   hydraulic conductivities. All three adjustments were incrementally
   incorporated into WEPP and each improved the average model efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{A series of experiments was conducted on two contrasting agricultural
   soils to observe the influence of soil texture, preferential flow, and
   plants on nitrate transport and denitrification under unsaturated
   conditions. Calcium nitrate fertilizer was applied to the surface of
   four large undisturbed soil cores (30 cm diameter by 40 cm height). Two
   of the cores were a structured clay obtained from central Missouri and
   two were an unstructured fine sand obtained from central Florida. The
   cores were irrigated daily and maintained at a matric potential of -20
   kPa, representative of soil tension in the rooting zone of irrigated
   agricultural fields. Volumetric water content (theta), concentration of
   nitrate-N in the soil solution, and nitrous oxide flux at the surface,
   10, 20, and 30 cm were monitored daily. Leaching loss of surface-applied
   NO3--N was significant in both the sand and the clay. In unplanted sand
   cores, almost all of the applied nitrate was leached below 30 cm within
   10 days. Gaseous N loss owing to denitrification was no greater than 2\%
   of the nitrate-N applied to the unplanted sand cores and, in general,
   was less than 1\%. Although leaching was somewhat retarded in the clay
   cores, about 60\% of the applied nitrate-N was leached from the
   unplanted clay soil in 5-6 weeks. Under unsaturated conditions, the clay
   had little to no tendency to denitrify despite the greater moisture
   content of the clay and retarded leaching of nitrate in the clay. The
   planted sand cores had surprisingly large gaseous N loss owing to
   denitrification, as much as 17\% of the nitrate-N. Results from both the
   clay and sand experiments show that the dynamics of nitrate transport
   and transformation in unsaturated soils are affected by small, localized
   variations in the soil moisture content profile, the gaseous diffusion
   coefficient of the soil, the rate at which the nitrate pulse passes
   through the soil, the solubility of N2O and N-2 and the diffusion of the
   gasses through the soil solution, and development of a water content
   profile in the soil. Limited denitrification in the clay soil was due to
   a limited volume of soil available for infiltration after internal
   catchment and the development of denitrifying conditions resulting from
   the presence of an extensive macropore system.}},

Abstract = {{Situated in the Campine region of Belgium, which is known for its thick
   sandy deposits and acid soils, the Buitengoor is a small headwater
   valley fen, containing many rich fen indicator species that are typical
   of neutral to alkaline soils. A hydrochemical survey of the surroundings
   of the fen pointed to an irrigation canal as a possible source of
   alkalinity for the fen. Just upstream of the fen, the alkaline canal
   water recharges the ground water. A piezometer transect from the canal
   to the fen illustrated the recharge pathway and the fate of alkalinity,
   cations and nutrients in the aquifer. Alkalinity and base cations are
   supplied to the fen while nutrients disappear out of solution. Although
   the normal hydroseral development of this fen would have been directed
   towards bog, the canal water caused an opposite development towards rich
   fen. This result illustrates the potential for groundwater flow systems
   to reverse peatland development in a short period of time (the canals
   were built in the last century). The potential for restoration of the
   rich fen habitat is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Simple and multiple linear regression models were used to estimate dry
   deposition and canopy leaching sources of constituents in throughfall
   and stemflow for adjacent deciduous and coniferous forests at the Panola
   Mountain Research Watershed (PMRW), Georgia. The models were evaluated
   for their comparability and statistical significance, and model fluxes
   were compared with fluxes derived from field collection and a dry
   deposition inferential model, i.e. field-inferred fluxes. The multiple
   regression model used antecedent dry period and event quantity as
   independent variables. Field-inferred fluxes indicated that dry
   deposition was a major source of SO42-, NO3- and H+ in throughfall, and
   canopy leaching was the major source of Ca2+ Mg2+, K+ and Cl- in both
   deciduous and coniferous forests. The canopy leaching flux predicted by
   the multiple linear regression model was: (1) within 30\% of the
   field-inferred fluxes for NH4+ in the deciduous and coniferous forest
   during the growing season; (2) within 40\% of field-inferred fluxes for
   Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ in the deciduous forest during the growing season and
   50\% in the dormant season; (3) within 67\% of field-inferred fluxes for
   H+ in the deciduous forest and Mg2+ and K+ in the coniferous forest.
   Similarly, dry deposition predicted by multiple linear regression model
   when compared with the field-inferred flux for the growing season was:
   (1) the same for Na+ in the deciduous forest; (2) 10\% more for Ca2+ in
   either forest; (3) about 20\% less for NH4+ in the deciduous forest; (4)
   70\% more for Mg2+ in the deciduous forest and K+ in the coniferous
   forest; (5) 50\% less for NH4+ in the coniferous forest; (6) 70\% less
   for SO42- in either forest. The multiple regression model, in general,
   was best applied to estimate dry deposition and canopy leaching of some
   constituents for the deciduous forest in the growing season, but it had
   limited applicability and cannot substitute for field collections for
   analysis of constituents with significant dry deposition at PMRW.}},

Abstract = {{Existing theories of flow and contaminant transport in aquifers are
   either based on Monte Carlo simulations or small perturbation solutions
   of the governing stochastic partial differential equations, which limit
   the applications to cases of small variances in the physical parameters,
   In this article scale-dependent models to predict mean contaminant
   concentration from point sources (well injection), and non-point sources
   (ground surface spills) in heterogeneous aquifers are developed and
   tested. A general analytic technique, the Neumann expansion, is used in
   the solution of the equations. This method does not require the
   assumptions of small perturbation, logarithmic transformations, or a
   specific probability law in the random quantities. In addition, aquifer
   parameters such as the mean pore velocity are functionally defined in
   terms of the underlying groundwater flow problem, and field-measurable
   aquifer hydrogeologic properties such as mean transmissivity, mean
   hydraulic gradient, mean porosity and aquifer thickness. Comparison with
   theoretical models, and verification with field tracer tests at the
   Borden aquifer indicated that the proposed models reproduced the
   enhanced longitudinal dispersion as a function of distance reported in
   the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrologic budget of a streamside urban peatland in south central
   Wisconsin, USA, was constructed, and the patterns of groundwater and
   surface water flow were described over a 2 year period. Precipitation
   and surface flow comprised over 95\% of the inputs to the wetland, while
   evapotranspiration was the major output. Evapotranspiration was
   significantly lower in cattail-dominated sections of the wetland. Low
   piezometric heads in and below the aquitard underneath the peatland
   created weak downward gradients from the wetland to the aquifer below.
   Within the peat itself, weak upward or discharge gradients were
   dominant. Three major patterns of horizontal shallow groundwater flow
   were seen, but shallow gradients and low hydraulic conductivities
   prevented large inputs or outputs of water through these pathways. The
   wetland has a large capacity for flood storage, but it did not make
   significant contributions to groundwater supplies or to streamflow
   during the time of this study. Error analysis revealed enormous
   uncertainties in many of the components of the budget.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted research to develop and test the accuracy of automated
   methods for producing long-term runoff contour maps of the eastern
   United States. Our goal was to determine if maps produced by these
   methods are as accurate as those now produced by manual methods. We
   examined nine procedures. One uses available runoff data only. Four use
   available runoff data and measured precipitation. The remaining four
   methods use runoff data and precipitation estimates from PRISM
   (Precipitation-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model).
   We evaluated the maps produced both qualitatively and quantitatively. We
   visually compared the automated procedure maps with a manual map
   produced by the U.S. Geological Survey. General visual agreement was
   very good among the maps. We also statistically compared estimated
   runoff at the precipitation stations with values interpolated from the
   manual map. The values of simple mean runoff computed for all of the
   methods were within about 1 cm (2\%) of that determined for the manual
   method.
   We conducted an uncertainty analysis in which we withheld gaged data
   from the production of the maps and then compared these data with values
   interpolated from the maps. Overall, the automated methods performed as
   well as or better than the manual method. A method based on PRISM-based
   runoff-to-precipitation ratios (RPRIS) gave the best results. The
   results of our work indicate that simple automated procedures can
   produce long-term runoff contour maps with regional accuracies
   equivalent or superior to those produced by manual methods.}},

Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{169}},
Number = {{1-4}},

Abstract = {{Pesticide transport through the unsaturated zone was modelled with an
   analytical solution of the convection-dispersion equation assuming
   steady water flow, a linear sorption isotherm and first-order
   transformation kinetics. Pesticide behaviour in the saturated zone was
   described with an analytical solution of the mass balance equation for a
   cylindrical flow system assuming steady how, no dispersion, linear
   sorption and first-order transformation. This simplified model for the
   unsaturated-saturated soil system was developed to identify the
   processes and parameters with the greatest impact on the fraction of
   applied pesticide reaching a drinking water well. Leaching from the
   unsaturated zone was highly sensitive to the parameters describing
   travel time and transformation rate. Leaching increased when
   heterogeneity of the soil was taken into account. Pesticide arrival in
   the well was only moderately sensitive to the characteristic travel time
   and transformation rate in the aquifer. However, this sensitivity
   increases if zones without pesticide application were introduced around
   the wells (protection zones). For representative sandy soils under
   average Dutch rainfall conditions, processes in the unsaturated zone had
   a much larger impact on pesticide arrival in the wells than processes in
   the saturated zone. Protection zones reduced pesticide transport to
   wells substantially if their half-life was much smaller than the
   characteristic travel time of the pesticide in the aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this paper is to represent a new Exemplar-Based
   Learning model and to apply this model for river flow estimation. The
   central idea of the model is based on a theory of learning from
   examples. This idea is similar to human intelligence: when people
   encounter new situations, they often explain them by remembering old
   experiences and adapting them to fit.
   To explore the stability and efficiency of the model performance, a
   simple mathematical function is simulated by the model. The model is
   then applied to extend the annual stream flow records according to the
   nearby stream flow stations and to classify the monthly flow by using
   the monthly rainfall and runoff information in the previous months. The
   results show that the model has better performance than the traditional
   methods and the results demonstrate the power and efficiency of the
   model for the hydrological data analysis.}},

Abstract = {{A surface, electrical geophysical method first suggested in 1920 holds
   great promise as a tool to detect contaminant source leaks and to
   delineate evolving contaminant plumes in suitable hydrogeologic
   environments. This tool, known as the mise-a-la-masse method, involves
   the measurement of electrical current how through the earth materials
   under investigation. Realization of the direct analogy between ground
   water flow and the flow of electricity through conductive media aids in
   the interpretation of electrical potential data derived by a modified
   mise-a-la-masse method presented herein.
   A modified mise-a-la-masse method was used to track the evolution of a
   conductive tracer plume over a period of 155 h. Voltage differences
   between 171 stationary, surface electrodes and a reference electrode
   were monitored over time to map the evolving tracer plume. For this
   particular experiment, the method proved to be about as sensitive as a
   portable, electrical conductivity meter to detect changes in the
   specific conductance of the ground water.}},

   rainfall is an essential component in the study of soil erosion and

   affected by infiltration (exfiltration) and percolation through the
   soil, both varying in time and space. A time-dependent model developed
   for analyzing the problem of overland flow on infiltrating surfaces is
   the subject matter of this paper. Infiltration (exfiltration) is
   computed using a finite element submodel for Darcian how through porous
   media. The computed flux across the soil surface becomes input to an
   overland flow submodel which uses a combination of the finite element
   and finite difference techniques. The computed depths of overland flow

Abstract = {{In a recent paper on water use efficiency (WUE) of Eucalypt trees, a
   large difference was found between WUE measured in a whole tree chamber
   and by micrometeorological methods, respectively. The former method gave
   up to 50\% higher WUE on clear days. The authors attributed this to a
   changed radiation regime inside the chamber and concluded that chambers
   were unsuitable for such studies. In this paper we point out the
   importance of considering also the dependence of vapour pressure deficit
   on WUE. Because of WUE's sensitivity to vapour pressure deficit, as
   illustrated by examples from several species, it is practically
   meaningless to make comparisons without compensating for differences in
   vapour pressure deficit. In our opinion, chamber can still play an
   important role in water relation and productivity studies.}},

   estimates of transpiration was higher during a dry period (about 13\%

Abstract = {{Strongly advective contaminant transport can occur in highly permeable,
   unsaturated media such as gravel, fractured clay and soil-containing
   macropores. Standard numerical solution techniques are both highly
   inaccurate and unstable under such fast flow regimes. The moving point
   technique has been applied to contaminant transport in groundwater and
   shown to provide an accurate solution to the convection-dispersion
   equation for advection-dominated transport. In this paper, the technique
   has been adapted for the simulation of transport of multiple species
   through sorbing, dual porosity, unsaturated media. In order to model
   one-dimensional vertical transport, moving points are translated at the
   effective retarded velocities, simulating convection and retardation of
   each species. The contaminant concentrations in the immobile region and
   the changes in mobile concentrations due to diffusion, dispersion and
   chemical reactions are then calculated by finite difference methods on a
   fixed grid. The moving point model has been validated against available
   analytical solutions for solute transport. Comparisons have been made
   with standard finite difference solutions. The moving point method is
   shown to be considerably more accurate than the finite difference
   solutions for convection-dominated flow.}},

   will continue, to a limited degree, unless either sulphur deposition is

   The detrimental changes in water quality owing to acid deposition and

Abstract = {{Understanding soil water movement is important for water resource
   management and for analyzing pollutant transport in the vadose zone,
   Seasonal variations in shallow soil profiles may have profound effects
   on deep soil water and solutes. We have investigated seasonal soil water
   movement in the top meter of undisturbed desert soil in the southern
   Arizona using H-2, O-18, Cl, and bomb-Cl-36. Six soil profiles were
   sampled from a young terrace (Holocene) during 1991 to 1992 on a
   seasonal basis. One soil profile was sampled from an older terrace
   (latest Pleistocene) in October 1992, and one from a yet older fan
   surface (late Pleistocene) in March 1992, The results indicate that
   repeated seasonal cyclic movement of soil water in the top 60-80 cm
   active zone tends to produce a consistent stable isotope composition for
   the soil water below the active zone in different seasons. The deep
   delta(18)O on the oldest surface is about 6 parts per thousand heavier
   than on the younger surfaces, probably resulting from greater
   evaporative loss due to the larger proportion of fines in the older
   soil. This deep isotopic composition is closely related to the
   composition of the local average annual precipitation. An annual average
   evaporation rate of 35 mm year(-1) was estimated using a steady-state
   diffusion model, whereas the actual regional evapotranspiration rate is
   175-250 mm year(-1). This suggests that about 80\% of the soil water is
   lost through transpiration and first-stage evaporation before quasi
   steady-state is reached, The long-term average infiltration rate below
   the active zone is about 4 mm year(-1) for the younger terrace, based on
   both chloride mass balance and bomb-Cl-36, and 0.02 mm year(-1) for the
   older terrace and the fan surface, based on chloride mass balance. The
   correlation between the deep delta(18)O, the reduction of downward flux
   and the surface age suggests that increasing soil development has
   resulted in a significant decrease of soil water infiltration and hence
   an increase in evaporation and surface runoff.}},

Abstract = {{The study concerns the effect of errors in input data on the quality of
   the results obtained with rainfall-runoff models. A simple conceptual
   algorithm was selected: two inputs (rain and evapotranspiration), one
   output (resulting runoff), and two parameters. Systematic and random
   errors were considered. The algorithm amplifies the initial systematic
   error to an extent which depends on the phase of the hydrograph. The
   model appears less sensitive to errors in evapotranspiration ETP than in
   rainfall. The distribution curves of random errors in rainfall and in
   runoff are very similar; there is no distortion of one compared to the
   other. Tests were carried out on the method of calibration to
   demonstrate the power of numerical algorithms of this type: they are
   capable of absorbing the initial error and of determining an optimal
   solution.}},

Abstract = {{A recently proposed method for calibrating lumped rainfall-runoff
   models, called FDTF-ERUHDIT, is analysed and evaluated on synthetic
   data. Based on the Unit Hydrograph concept this method performs a
   simultaneous identification of the excess rainfall se;ies and the
   transfer function or unit hydrograph through an alternating iterative
   procedure without presuming any runoff production model or applying any
   arbitrary baseflow removal. A general evaluation framework was built to
   allow for generation of realistic data both error-free and contaminated
   with controlled errors. The problems of the method's convergence and
   sensitivity to errors in the data and the model structure assumed are
   tackled. A rather exhaustive series of tests involve also evaluations of
   the effects of a priori choices of optimisation algorithms and their
   parameters, as well as assessments of sampling effects. Combinations of
   these factors are also tested. Finally, useful guidelines for practical
   use of the new identification approach are derived.}},

Abstract = {{The vacuum distillation method of extracting soil water for stable
   isotope analysis was tested for three different types of soil
   characterized by high water content: (1) pure sand, (2) cambisol with
   high organic matter content, developed on calcareous sandstone under
   temperate climatic conditions (Austria), and (3) tropical latosol poor
   in organic matter, developed on sandy clay sediment (Brazil). The method
   yields accurate and reproducible results for sand, provided that more
   than 98\% of the original soil water is extracted. The time required for
   complete extraction is a function of sample size and the applied
   extraction temperature. Column experiments with the clayey soils
   revealed existence of a weakly bound, easily exchangeable pool of water
   which is isotopically different from the mobile water. The experiments
   showed that the extracted soil water is depleted in both deuterium and
   oxygen-18 by 5-10 parts per thousand and 0.3-0.5 parts per thousand,
   respectively, when compared with the percolate (mobile water). This
   depletion depends strongly on the soil type. The reproducibility for
   replicate extractions of soil water from clayey soils is around +/-3
   parts per thousand and 0.3 parts per thousand for 6D and delta(18)O,

Abstract = {{The chemistry of major elements (Ca, K, Mg, Na, SiO2, Cl-, SO4-2 and
   alkalinity etc.) from the Huanghe (Yellow River) is examined with data
   obtained from the main channel in August 1986; in combination with
   previous studies. The results show that the dissolved load of the
   Huanghe relative to water discharge and in absolute terms is very high
   compared with other major world rivers. The Huanghe transports seawards
   ca. 410 x 10(9) mol year(-1) of dissolved ions with a chemical erosion
   rate close to the world average. Atmospheric input of major elements to
   the Huanghe is very limited. Weathering and erosion are of primary
   importance in affecting river chemistry, which is accelerated by
   anthropogenic activities (e.g. farming). Globally, high chemical loads
   are observed from large Asian rivers, in consequence of serious physical
   and chemical erosions and bad farming over the Sino-Indian subcontinent.}},

Abstract = {{Field measurement of interception loss from rainforest vegetation in the
   cyclone-prone tropics is complicated by high wind speeds that cause
   incident rainfall to be inclined from vertical fall paths. Given the
   characteristic roughness of tropical rainforest canopies, we
   hypothesized that the more prominent canopy tree crowns create lateral
   rainshadows and intercept greater volumes of rainwater per unit
   projected crown area than less prominent neighboring canopy trees under
   inclined rainfall conditions. This hypothesis was tested by: (1)
   modeling the three-dimensional (3-D) geometry of a tropical rainforest
   canopy surface in northeast Queensland, Australia, using
   photogrammetrically derived crown elevation data; (2) computing the
   inclination angles and azimuths of wind-driven rainfall for raindays on
   which net rainfall was measured from selected canopy trees; (3) creating
   and applying a ray-tracing program to the 3-D canopy model to quantify
   lateral rainshadows and the effective rainfall-intercepting crown areas
   of the selected canopy trees; (4) calculating the C-e/C index (effective
   rainfall-intercepting crown area/projected crown area ratio) of each
   tree; (5) analyzing the relationship between the C-e/C index values and
   the measured net rainfall totals after correcting for differences in the
   trees' interception storage capacities. A significant correlation (P <
   0.05) was found for more than 80\% of the raindays examined with
   rainfall inclination angles of more than 19 degrees from a vertical fall
   path. These results suggest that the variation in net rainfall totals
   among neighboring canopy trees may be explained in part by the
   differential interception of inclined rainfall. Interception loss is
   generally measured as the difference between gross rainfall measured in
   the open and net rainfall reaching the forest floor. We conclude that
   more meaningful measures of interception loss could be obtained by
   accounting for differences in gross rainfall intercepted by canopy trees
   sampled for net rainfall.}},

Abstract = {{Headwater catchments are important and often overlooked hydrologic
   components of drainage basins. Hydrologic response at different scales
   was evaluated during a period of increasing antecedent wetness in a
   steep, humid catchment in coastal Japan. Outflows from a second-order
   basin (EB, 15.7 ha), two first-order basins (B, 2.48 ha and A, 0.84 ha),
   a zero-order basin (0.25 ha), and a hillslope segment (0.0045 ha) were
   measured for nine individual storms prior to and during the typhoon
   season of 1992. Antecedent rainfall greatly influenced the dynamic
   contributions from various watershed components. During drier conditions
   at the beginning of the typhoon season, storm runoff was small (< 2.5\%
   of rainfall), largely generated by contributions from the narrow
   riparian zone. As wetness increased, subsurface flow from a hillslope
   segment contributed 2.0-3.4 times the runoff (on a unit contributing
   area basis) as the entire forest basin B. At least the lower 20\% of the
   hillslope appeared to contribute actively to subsurface stormflow during
   late season events with very wet antecedent conditions. During major
   storms with high antecedent moisture, macropore flow comprised more than
   25\% of total subsurface flow during the peak and recession limbs of
   hydrographs. Almost no macropore flow occurred during storms with dry
   antecedent conditions. Zero-order basins with shallow soils appear to
   contribute to stormflow once a threshold of saturation is reached; after
   this point these geomorphic hollows contribute similar magnitudes of
   flow (per unit area) as subsurface hillslope drainage. Water yields
   during the two largest storms (with wet antecedent conditions) were
   higher in basin EB (16.6-25.6\%) than in basin B (11.6-19.5\%), partly
   owing to reduced canopy interception in the cutover portion of EB.
   During the two smallest storms (dry antecedent conditions) the opposite
   pattern occurred, likely because of the limited contributing area of
   stormflow near the stream channel. The dynamic hydrologic contributions

   conditions and spatial patterns of suspended sediment at a stream
   confluence is evaluated using suspended-sediment data collected at a
   small stream confluence in east-central Illinois, USA. Patterns of
   normalized sediment concentrations at a cross-section near the exit of
   the confluence are a function of the ratios of momentum flux and mean
   sediment concentration in the upstream channels. These patterns reflect
   a shift in the location of the shear layer toward the outer bank as
   momentum ratio increases. Appreciable cross-channel mixing occurs within
   a distance of four channel widths downstream from the confluence, These
   findings suggest that confluence hydrodynamics may have important
   effects on the dispersal of dissolved or suspended substances in
   headwater areas of channel networks.}},

   probability-weighted moments (PWMs) on the parameters of the probability
   distributions (PDs) of three-parameter log-normal, log-Pearson-3,
   general extreme value, and Wakeby by the method of PWMs has been
   experimentally investigated. The method of maximum-likelihood has also
   been applied on the three three-parameter PDs. Altogether 19 models were
   formed. The prediction of the three right-tail quantiles of T = 100, T =
   1000, and T = 10 000 year return-period peaks by any PD has been
   determined by comparing the distributions of the 1000 relative errors of
   each one of these three extreme values computed out of 1000 short
   synthetic samples from the same quantiles of the parent distributions.
   Inspection of box plots of such computed relative errors led to the
   conclusion that the general extreme value and log-Pearson-3 PDs applied
   by the method of PWMs using the Landwehr PPF are the better models of
   the 19 considered. Three-parameter log-normal distribution either by the
   method of maximum-likelihood or by the method of PWMs using the PPF of
   either (i - 0.35)/n or Landwehr turned out to be almost as good as those
   two. Convincing evidence for superiority of the Wakeby PD over these
   three three-parameter PDs has not been found.}},

Abstract = {{Regional maps of evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff/precipitation ratios
   (R/P) are rare for the United States. We have found mapping of ET and
   R/P to be a useful part of our work on runoff mapping, which in turn was
   a necessary part of our assessments of effects of acidic deposition.
   Maps of ET and R/P could be useful in other water resource analyses as
   well. Toward this end we present maps of these variables that we have
   prepared for the northeastern United States.
   We compute ET and R/P from the water balance equation with measured
   runoff and precipitation and (in one case) modeled estimates of
   precipitation. We have mapped ET and R/P in three different ways. First,
   we have mapped them by Major Land-Use Resource Areas (MLRA). We have
   performed this mapping for both a long-term period (1951-1980) and an
   especially wet water year, water-year 1984 (WY84). Second, we have
   mapped ET and R/P using an automated contouring procedure in association
   with modeled estimates of precipitation from PRISM
   (Precipitation-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model).
   Third, we have manually contoured the variables based on measured values
   of runoff and precipitation as they appear to relate to elevation, land
   use, and vegetation. Our maps compare well with each other and with the
   relatively few prior efforts at such mapping for the region. Our
   findings indicate that ET tends to be much more conservative over time
   than R/P, which tended to be greater in the wet year (WY84).
   As would be expected, the three approaches have relative strengths and
   weaknesses. Mapping by MLRA may be more useful when measured estimates
   are few or when lack of local expertise limits contouring subjectively.
   Contouring allows for more detailed representation of patterns.
   Automated contouring has the advantages of efficiency and
   reproducibility, whereas manual contouring allows the exercise of
   potentially more accurate expert local knowledge, when it exists.}},

Abstract = {{Steady-state theories have been developed for flow into an auger hole in
   a homogeneous and anisotropic soil medium when (i) there is an
   impermeable layer at the bottom of the auger hole and (ii) there is an
   impermeable barrier at a finite distance below the bottom of the auger
   hole. The proposed theories can be modified easily for an isotropic Soil
   condition and the partially penetrating auger hole theory presented here
   is simpler than the existing theories (Kirkham, 1958; Boast and Kirkham,
   1971) for the same soil condition. Furthermore, the theories can be
   applied directly, i.e. without transformation of coordinate axes, to
   determine the directional conductivities of an anisotropic medium (and
   hence also the hydraulic conductivity of an isotropic medium since ah
   anisotropic medium can be transformed into an isotropic one simply by
   treating the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the medium as equal to
   its vertical hydraulic conductivity) from auger hole experimental data
   below a water table.}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarises methods for creating maps of river discharge, and
   evaluates them using river flow data from Europe. Most published maps
   are isoline maps, but choropleth maps are more appropriate for showing
   the spatial distribution of river flow. Five approaches to producing
   grid choropleth maps can be identified. The first averages the data from
   all the small catchments in a grid cell; this overestimates runoff. The
   second involves statistical interpolation around small catchments, but
   it,is difficult to account for ah the details of spatial variability in
   a statistical interpolation. The third method uses empirical
   relationships to estimate runoff from gridded climate data; the results,
   however, depend on the climate data used. The fourth approach uses a
   water balance model to estimate runoff from gridded climate data; it
   also is dependent on the input climate data. A final approach produces a
   weighted cell average based on catchment runoff maps, and this was shown
   to produce reasonable estimates of gridded runoff.}},

   INFLUENCE OF PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF THE MEDIUM}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Recent work in the transport of particulate matter (e.g. bacteria,
   viruses, colloids, mineral grains, etc.) through saturated porous media
   has indicated that the physical structure of the porous medium plays an
   important role in both the ability of the particles to be transported
   and the distribution of the particles deposited within the medium. The
   present paper addresses the influence on particle transport within
   saturated porous media of high-permeability pathways and contacts
   between different grain size distributions. The experiments discussed in
   the present paper were conducted in two dimensions. The porous media
   were constructed from glass beads and the tracer utilized consisted of
   latex spheres in the size range 2-90 mu m (2-30 mu m in most
   experiments). Among the media designs investigated were simple layers in
   which flow was parallel to layers, simple layers in which flow was at an
   angle to layers, a simple form of heterogeneity including non-parallel
   layers and disjoint inclusions, and a complex heterogeneity involving
   three interconnected permeabilities. Results from these experiments
   demonstrated that significantly greater numbers of particles were
   deposited at media contacts where water moved from larger to smaller
   diameter glass beads. Further, it was observed that outflow
   concentrations of particles for media containing continuous flow paths
   within the coarse glass beads were substantially higher than outflow
   concentrations of particles for media containing a number of interfaces
   between different-sized glass beads. Specifically, a comparison of the
   results for a medium in which flow was parallel to layers with results
   from a medium in which flow was at an angle to the layers led to the
   observation of higher concentrations of latex particles in the outflow
   from the former medium and high concentrations of particles remaining in
   the region of layer contacts within the latter medium. Similar
   observations were made in a comparison of the simple and complex
   heterogeneities. Based on these results and prediction of straining
   based on the filtration literature, it is argued that the enhanced
   deposition observed near contacts results from sorption leading to
   increased straining in regions of lower uniformity in the glass bead
   distribution. These results demonstrate the importance of particle
   transport along high-permeability pathways and the enhanced deposition
   which may occur at contact surfaces within heterogeneous porous media.}},

Abstract = {{Several authors have addressed the question of identifying the location
   of and quantifying the volume of groundwater/surface water interaction.
   Utilizing measurement of temperature within the sediments has been
   suggested as a means of estimating water flux through the sediments. A
   qualitative version of this method has been applied to identifying
   locations of communication between a creek and groundwater based upon
   temperature time series measurements in the water column and the
   sediments. The discussion presented earlier is extended to a more
   general solution which allows for incorporation of measured surface
   temperature (rather than an assumed surface temperature). The
   mathematical formulation presented is targeted on the quantification of
   flux across the sediment for conditions of one-dimensional downflow with
   a constant flux over periods of days to weeks. This technique, based on
   the assumption that the temperature of the surface water is the primary
   thermal influence on sediment temperature, is shown to provide an
   estimate of fluid flux (volume of water per area per time) for flux
   rates above a critical threshold, The flux threshold depends on a number
   of factors including thermal diffusivity of the sediments and depth of
   burial of the temperature measuring device, Based on use of three simple
   forcing functions for temperature at the surface of the sediments, it is
   shown that the amplitude of the temperature response in the sediments to
   a change in temperature in the overlying water column decreases with
   increasing depth and decreasing flux, Further, the timing of the peak
   response in the sediments becomes increasingly delayed as depth
   increases and flux decreases. These observations, combined with
   consideration of the assumption of one-dimensional flow, lead to
   suggesting that field design be based on relatively shallow burial (e.g.
   5-15 cm) of the device to measure sediment temperatures. Based on these
   observations, one of the data sets presented earlier is reanalyzed to
   derive flux estimates, It is shown that a reasonable fit is obtained
   with a downflow flux of less than 0.03 cm day(-1). Independent
   measurement of hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity provide a
   range of flux estimates for the same site (although measured in a
   different year) which are consistent with this value. Based on these
   results, it is argued that this technique is a reasonable screening tool
   for use in situations where relatively inexpensive, point estimates of
   water flux are required within losing reaches of a creek.}},

Abstract = {{The impacts of climate change on runoff and soil moisture in 28
   Australian catchments are simulated using a hydrologic daily
   rainfall-runoff model. Two methods are used to provide the climate
   change scenarios. First, a range of arbitrary changes in temperature and
   precipitation are applied to the calibrated rainfall-runoff model to
   study the sensitivity of runoff and soil moisture to potential changes
   in the climate. Second, results from five global climate model (GCM)
   enhanced greenhouse experiments are analysed to provide regional climate
   change scenarios to estimate the range of plausible changes in runoff
   and soil moisture by the years 2030 and 2070.
   The sensitivity analyses indicate that changes in rainfall are always
   amplified in runoff with the amplification factor for runoff being
   higher in drier catchments. The change in rainfall has little effect on
   the soil moisture in wet catchments but in drier catchments, the
   percentage change in soil moisture levels can be greater than the
   percentage change in rainfall. Compared to precipitation, temperature
   increases alone have negligible impacts on the runoff and soil moisture.
   The simulations using the GCM scenarios indicate increases in annual
   runoff of up to 25\% by the year 2030 in the wet tropical catchments
   near the north-east coast of Australia. The GCMs do not agree in the
   direction of rainfall change in south-east Australia, and the
   simulations show runoff changes of up to +/-20\% by 2030. For Tasmanian
   catchments, up to 10\% increase in runoff is simulated whereas for
   catchments in the South Australian Gulf, up to 35\% decrease in annual
   runoff is simulated for 2030. Near the western coast of Australia, the
   simulations show runoff changes of up to +/-50\%. These results show the
   potential for climate change to bring about runoff modifications that
   may require a significant planning response. They are also indicative of
   the fact that hydrological impacts affecting water supply and flood
   studies may be important in considering the cost and benefits of
   potential climate change.}},

Abstract = {{With the aim of studying the hydraulic behaviour and isotopic effects in
   refuse dumps, measurements of the O-18 and H-2 content of rainwater
   infiltrating into large cylindrical refuse lysimeters (1.5-4 m height
   with diameter of about 5 m), installed by the Technical University of
   Brunswick, Germany, were performed. The 11 lysimeters were filled with
   household refuse and sewage sludge under different conditions
   (aerobic/anaerobic, compaction, layering). The longterm hydraulic
   parameters of flow through the lysimeters (transit time, apparent
   dispersivity, volume of total water) were estimated with a specially
   adapted black-box model, which used isotopic content curves of rainwater
   and infiltrated water sampled at different depths in the lysimeters. The
   transit times of rainwater through the lysimeters (3-6 years) and the
   mean flow velocities deduced from them (0.4-1 m year(-1)), correspond to
   values in the unsaturated zone of sandy aquifers. The dispersivities are
   in the range of 0.1-1 cm. A special attempt was made to follow
   individual heavy rain events and estimate the travel times and portions
   of rainwater percolating swiftly through the lysimeter. It was found
   that up to 40\% of those precipitation events drains off directly, i.e.
   within a few weeks. However, as it remains only a short time in the
   lysimeter, this water should not be greatly affected by the lysimeter
   filling. In addition, by evaluating the delta(2)H-delta(18)O
   relationship of the water samples from the different lysimeter sampling
   points, it was possible to differentiate, on a preliminary basis,
   isotopic effects caused by evaporation and biochemical reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Sandy loam topsoils overlying sandy clay subsoils on hillslopes in
   southwestern Australia are often waterlogged. The relative importance of
   soil, landform, climatic and drainage factors on waterlogging intensity
   was assessed from 1984 to 1986. The SEW(30) index was used to quantify
   waterlogging intensity, as measured in 162 shallow wells in five
   subcatchments.
   Waterlogging is caused by the development of a perched watertable on the
   subsoil clay. Gravel within the soil profile reduces the porosity and
   thus the water storage capacity of the soil. Waterlogging intensity is
   low where topsoils are deeper than about 0.6 m; where the soil profile
   has an A(2) horizon with high hydraulic conductivity (up to 7.8 m
   day(-1)) and the site is sloping, facilitating lateral flows.
   The hydraulic conductivity of the B horizon can change by as much as two
   orders of magnitude over a 10 m lateral distance. The sites most
   susceptible to waterlogging have subsoils with a hydraulic conductivity
   less than 0.003 m day(-1) and topsoils which are less than 0.4 m thick.
   Susceptible soils became waterlogged in early winter, after rainfall
   exceeded pan evaporation by just 50 mm whereas others remained well
   drained even in the wettest years.
   Q(0) = 2.5 x 10(-3) m(2) day(-1) per m cross-section of the soil is a
   critical value of transmission capacity that induces severe waterlogging
   in these catchments.}},

Title = {{THE USE OF STRONTIUM ISOTOPES IN DETERMINING GROUNDWATER MIXING AND
   BRINE FINGERING IN A PLAYA SPRING ZONE, LAKE TYRRELL, AUSTRALIA}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Playas in arid and semi-arid regions can be important regional
   groundwater discharge zones. Located in the northwestern portion of
   Victoria, Australia, Lake Tyrrell is a large playa that serves as a
   major discharge zone of regional groundwater. The chemistry of the
   regional groundwater is unique, having salinities of approximately 30 g
   l(-1) and pH values as low as 2.8. As the regional groundwater is
   discharged along the western edge of the playa in the `spring zone', it
   is evapo-concentrated into a dense brine which sinks through the playa
   sediments, Macumber's pioneering work on the geohydrology of this region
   established that this denser, `reflux' brine below the playa surface has
   evolved from the evaporation of regional groundwaters.
   We have measured the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of a number of groundwater
   samples taken at shallow depths along the spring zone at the playa edge
   and compared them with the regional groundwaters and the reflux brine.
   Our data reveal a rather complex pattern of mixing of the various water
   masses associated with the playa system, most probably the result of
   density driven convective plumes. Two types of regional groundwater can
   be identified based on their Sr-87/Sr-86 values, with groundwater from
   the south being less radiogenic than that flowing from the north (i.e.
   0.7108 vs. 0.7142). Vertical variations in Sr-87/Sr-86 in the regional
   groundwaters observed in wells adjacent to the spring zone can also be
   identified along a vertical gradient in the spring zone, Besides the
   hydrogeological information provided by these measurements, the
   strontium isotope variations allow us to evaluate the source of
   strontium to these waters. The regional groundwaters south of the lake
   are very similar in Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio to the reflux brines, whereas the
   northern regional groundwaters are comparatively enriched in Sr-87. This
   enhanced Sr-87 signature indicates the addition of Sr along the flow
   path via the weathering of the aquifer material, the Miocene Parilla
   Sand. The southern waters have Sr-87/Sr-86 values closer to that of
   present-day seawater and/or Miocene seawater, indicating that the major
   source of Sr to the system is from one or both of these sources. Our
   results demonstrate that strontium isotopes can be extremely useful in
   studying the dynamics as well as the geochemistry of
   surface-water-groundwater interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Stream flow in the Coastal Plain of New Jersey is primarily controlled
   by ground-water discharge. Ground-water flow in a 400 square mile area
   (1035 km(2)) of the Potomac-Raritan-Magothy aquifer system (PRMA) in the
   northern Coastal Plain of New Jersey was simulated to examine
   development effects on water resources. Simulations showed that
   historical development caused significant capture of regional
   ground-water discharge to streams and wetlands. The Cretaceous PRMA
   primarily is composed of fine to coarse sand, clays and silts which form
   the Upper and Middle aquifers and their confining units. The aquifer
   outcrops are the principal areas of recharge and discharge for the
   regional flow system and have many traversing streams and surface-water
   bodies.
   A quasi-three-dimensional numerical model that incorporated
   ground-water/surface-water interactions and boundary flows from a larger
   regional model was used to represent the PRMA. To evaluate the influence
   of ground-water development on interactions in different areas,
   hydrogeologically similar and contiguous model stream cells were
   aggregated as `stream zones'. The model representation of surface-water
   and ground-water interaction was limited in the areas of confining unit
   outcrops and because of this, simulated ground-water discharge could not
   be directly compared with base flow.
   Significant differences in simulated ground-water and surface-water
   interactions between the predevelopment and developed system, include;
   (1) redistribution of recharge and discharge areas; (2) reduced
   ground-water discharge to streams. In predevelopment, the primary
   discharge for the Upper and Middle aquifers is to low-lying streams and
   wetlands; in the developed system, the primary discharge is to
   ground-water withdrawals. Development reduces simulated ground-water
   discharge to streams in the Upper Aquifer from 61.4 to 10\% of the Upper
   Aquifer hydrologic budget (28.9\%, if impounded stream flow is
   included). Ground-water discharge to streams in the Middle Aquifer
   decreases from 80.0 to 22\% of the Middle Aquifer hydrologic budget. The
   utility of assessing ground-water/surface-water interaction in a
   regional hydrogeologic system by simulation responses to development is
   demonstrated and which can compensate for lack of long-term
   stream-gaging data in determining management decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical compositions of six travertine-depositing hot spring waters
   in Italy are described with emphasis on the carbon dioxide system. All
   springs contained high concentrations of CO2 (>20 mM l(-1)) with
   equilibrium partial pressures well above those which could have been
   formed in contact with a soil atmosphere. After surfacing, the CO2 is
   rapidly lost to the atmosphere, with evasion rates close to the springs
   ranging from 0.45-4.41 mM m(-2) s(-1). Partial pressures of CO2 showed
   an exponential decline with distance, which is consistent with the
   static film model where temperature and turbulence are constant.
   Downstream CO2 transfer coefficients, which ranged from 66 to 360 cm
   h(-1) were consistent with moderately turbulent flow, however, there was
   no correlation between turbulence, measured as the mean shear stress,
   and CO2 evasion rate. The channels investigated had all been modified by
   man and most possessed even widths and gradients.
   All waters became increasingly supersaturated with aragonite and calcite
   downstream and both of these minerals were present in fresh travertine
   deposits. The supersaturation was driven almost exclusively by gas
   evasion. Comparison of daytime and nighttime evasion rates demonstrated
   that photosynthetic activity was an insignificant source of CO2 flux in
   the reaches investigated. Carbon dioxide evasion is therefore primarily
   responsible for the supersaturation and probably also the deposition of
   travertine at these sites.
   The CaCO3 content of the travertines ranged from 91.3 to 96.0 wt\% with
   1.7-4.1\% CaSO4, traces of organic matter and acid-insoluble minerals.}},

Abstract = {{A distributed model for real-time rainfall-runoff simulation during
   floods is presented. The model, called Distributed Basin Simulator
   (DBSIM) is based on the detailed topographical information provided by
   Digital Elevation Models (DEM). Basin representation uses the
   rectangular grid of the DEM. Soil properties, input data and state
   variables are also represented as data layers using the same scheme.
   Distributed rainfall input is used to map the topographically driven
   evolution of saturated areas as the storm progresses. The model applies
   a kinematic model of infiltration to evaluate local runoff generation in
   grid elements and accounts for lateral moisture flow between elements
   and surface flow routing in a simplified manner. Model performance is
   evaluated through sensitivity analyses and an exercise of model
   calibration and verification.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental isotope and noble gas data are shown to identify the
   global parameters of the thermal water system in Ladek Zdroj (Spa),
   Sudeten, Poland. The mean C-14 age is about 5 ka, and the delta(18)O and
   SD data are assumed to yield the mean altitude of recharge by making use
   of the altitude effect known for the Sudeten area. The natural discharge
   rate multiplied by the C-14 age gives the total volume of water, whereas
   the volume of the host rock is roughly estimated for three scenarios of
   system dimensions. For these scenarios, the ratio of these two volumes
   yield a total porosity in the range of about 0.005-0.014, which, in a
   good approximation, should be equal to the matrix porosity. Laboratory
   determinations of unaltered rock samples yield a matrix porosity of
   0.008 +/- 0.001. For the three scenarios, the tracer age and matrix
   porosity are shown to yield a hydraulic conductivity for the whole
   system in the range 0.8-1.6 x 10(-8) ms(-1), without any knowledge of
   the fissure network parameters. Noble gas temperature compared with
   known temperature dependence yields the mean altitude of the recharge
   area equal to that found from the delta(18)O and SD data. The radiogenic
   He-4 excess and Ar-40/Ar-36 ratios are consistent with the mid-Holocene
   age determined from the C-14 data.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for using stable isotopes of water (H-2, O-18) for determining
   the sources of water transpired by plants in a semi-arid field situation
   are validated. A comparison of the isotopic composition of the soil
   water in zones of high soil water potential (and hence high plant water
   availability) with that in plants shows that the overall approach is
   subject to a randomly distributed error of 5\% in H-2 isotopic
   composition with no indication of any bias. This includes errors
   involved in the extraction of water from plants and soil, in spatial
   heterogeneity in soil profiles, in heterogeneity within plant canopies,
   in the time of travel of water through the plant, and in assumptions
   about fractionation of isotopes during water uptake by plants. These
   errors are generally smaller than natural variations of isotope, thus
   allowing the isotopic method to be used. Similarly, an estimate for the
   error in O-18 is 1\%. A compartmental model was used to quantify errors
   associated with an inversion model using isotopic data of water coming
   from two soil layers. The error in the estimation of the fraction of
   water taken from each compartment was 20\%. For many hydrological
   purposes, this error is acceptable. This is the first study estimating
   the errors associated with the method.}},

Abstract = {{The delta(18)O and delta D measurements of surface waters (streams,
   springs, lakes and precipitation) from the Gaula river catchment area of
   Kumaun Himalaya are reported. The delta D and delta(18)O values are
   positively correlated, as has been the case with waters from several
   other regions. The lake waters are found to be enriched in O-18 and D
   compared with the neighbouring regions owing to evaporation. Estimates
   of mean total evaporation during the dry season range from 10 to 25\%.
   Spring water samples collected from various altitudes (from 915 m to
   2150 m) display variations in values showing an altitude effect of -0.14
   parts per thousand per 100 m elevation.}},

Abstract = {{This study compares measured and modelled energy fluxes and surface
   temperatures calculated with three land-surface parametrization schemes
   of varying complexity. The Penman-Monteith equation, the big-leaf model
   SiB and the multilayer model Cupid have been tested with data from the
   LOTREX 10E/HIBE89 experiment. Two days with almost clear sky, 5 and 6
   July 1989, were chosen for the present tests. Soil and vegetation input
   parameters were taken from the literature and from field observations.
   All three models capture the magnitude and behaviour of the energy
   balance terms. Cupid, which is the most complex of the three models,
   shows the best agreement between measurements and simulations, with the
   advantage that the intercomparison of vertical profiles of temperature,
   humidity and wind within and above the vegetation is possible. The
   partitioning between sensible and latent heat fluxes predicted with the
   Penman-Monteith equation is also in good agreement with the
   measurements, taking into account the simplicity of this method.
   Discrepancies are observed in the relative contributions of the canopy
   transpiration and surface evaporation to the total latent heat flux
   calculated with SiB and Cupid.}},

Abstract = {{When examining the various soil-plant-atmosphere models proposed in the
   literature, it becomes obvious that, according to the speciality of
   their authors, one or several compartments of the model are generally
   very detailed, whereas the other compartments remain crude. The aim of
   this work was first, to build a model, including the main physical
   processes, but with equivalent degrees of simplification for all the
   compartments and, second, to provide a validation as complete as
   possible for the various compartments.
   The resulting model, driven by meteorological forcing at a reference
   level (incoming solar and long-wave radiation, air temperature, humidity
   and wind speed, and rainfall), can be divided into four main
   compartments. In the soil, coupled heat and mass transfer equations,
   including liquid and vapour phase transfer, are solved. In the
   atmosphere, stability is taken into account in the calculation of the
   aerodynamic resistances. At the soil-plant-atmosphere interface, one
   vegetation layer is considered, with two energy budgets: one for the
   bare soil fraction of the plot and one for the vegetated fraction. In
   the soil, root uptake is modelled using an electrical analogue scheme
   with various resistances (soil, root, xylem). Finally, in the case of
   rainfall (or irrigation), interception, infiltration and runoff is
   calculated.
   The model is first described and then compared with field data collected
   on a soybean plot of 0.72 ha. The soil is composed of three horizons,
   the hydraulic and thermal properties of which were determined
   experimentally. The atmospheric forcing and the net radiation were
   measured. The sensible heat flux above the canopy was deduced from wind
   speed and temperature profiles. In the soil, water pressure, water
   content and temperature were measured at several depths. Temperature
   profiles also allowed for the derivation of the soil heat flux at the
   ground surface and the latent heat flux was obtained from the energy
   budget. Plant height, leaf area index and leaf water potential were also
   recorded on several days. Seven days of complete measurements were
   available: 2 days were under dry conditions (19-20 August 1991) and 5
   days under wet conditions (24-28 August 1991) following a rainfall of 45
   mm on 22 August 1991. Missing parameters were calibrated using the first
   3 days of the wet period (24-26 August 1991) and the model was validated
   on the remaining days. A fair agreement between the model and the data
   was observed for both atmospheric fluxes, for soil variables (water
   content and temperature) and for leaf water potential, provided only an
   accurate determination of the parameters was made.}},

Abstract = {{A simple scheme is developed to describe how vegetation and the
   convective boundary layer (CBL) interact during daylight in terms of
   water and sensible heat exchange. The response of vegetation to a
   prescribed atmospheric state is defined by a quadratic equation obtained
   by combining the Penman-Monteith equation with a new relation between
   surface conductance and transpiration rate based on laboratory evidence.
   The complementary response of the CBL to the input of sensible and
   latent at the ground surface is summarized by a simple relation between
   the Priestley-Taylor coefficient and surface conductance that fits daily
   mean values for diverse types of vegetation. The two responses are
   combined to provide a measure of `accommodation' between vegetation and
   the atmosphere such that mean daily values of transpiration rate and
   saturation deficit can be obtained as functions of surface conductance
   and the net input of radiant heat.}},

Abstract = {{Many models that describe the energy balance of plant canopies are
   unsuitable for use as components of larger-scale climate models because
   their computational and data input requirements are too large. Models
   based on `higher-order-closure' and Lagrangian simulations of particle
   trajectories provide examples. More practical models are usually based
   on diffusion theory, even though turbulent transport within canopies is
   not a diffusive process. Recently, Raupach (Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc.,
   115, 609-632, 1989) presented an efficient analytical model based on
   Lagrangian principles. In Raupach's theory, the profile of scalar
   concentration within a canopy is described as the sum of a `far-field'
   contribution, predicted using diffusion theory, and a `near-field'
   contribution, for which the diffusion equation is inappropriate. The
   latter contribution is referred to as `non-diffusive' transport. This
   approach still requires a detailed description of canopy turbulence and
   the distribution of sources.
   In this paper, Raupach's theory is used to develop a model for a
   `typical' two-layer canopy consisting of an overstorey and a ground
   layer. An expression for the average `near-field' contribution within
   the upper storey is derived by integrating Raupach's equations. This
   average contribution is computed for a range of `typical' scalar source
   profiles and turbulence profiles in the overstorey. It is shown that the
   near-field contribution is rather insensitive to the description of the
   canopy turbulence and it is not unduly sensitive to the assumed source
   distribution, particularly as its total contribution is rather small.
   The average `near-field' contribution to the scalar profile in the
   overstorey can be represented by a `near-field resistance', r(n), which
   can be added to a traditional resistance model, The modified model can
   then predict counter-gradient fluxes in appropriate cases. Because the
   near-field resistance is small compared with the `far-field' resistances
   of the model, the results show that non-diffusive exchange processes
   play a minor role in determining transport of scalars between the
   atmosphere and dense plant canopies.}},

Abstract = {{Wind speed and temperature were measured within a corn row canopy to
   investigate horizontal and vertical variability of the mean wind speed
   and temperature. It appears that the mean wind speed can vary between
   20\% and 30\% from its horizontal mean value. In the narrow row crop,
   the horizontal mean air temperature varies between 0.1 degrees C
   (night-time) and 0.35 degrees C (daytime) from the spatial mean value.
   Exceptions occur around noon in daytime when direct irradiation
   dominates and where the direct beam illuminates the within-row space of
   the canopy. Then, deviations of 1 degrees C or more from the horizontal
   mean value are observed. Attention was focused on finding adequate
   scaling parameters of the within-canopy wind speed and air temperature
   profiles under various atmospheric stratification states. During daytime
   and night-time, the above-canopy friction velocity appears to be a good
   scaling parameter. Clear nights, however, are exceptions, when the
   above-crop wind speed drops to a very low value. Then, the within-canopy
   free convection velocity scale appears to be an appropriate scaling
   parameter for within-canopy processes. During daytime, the within-canopy
   temperature profiles scale well with the above-canopy temperature scale,
   T{*}, for stationary irradiation and wind speed regimes. On calm nights,
   however, the relative within-canopy temperature profile scales very well
   with the within-canopy free convection temperature scale, theta{*}.}},

Abstract = {{Turbulent fluctuations of atmospheric properties near the
   soil-vegetation-atmosphere interface have been investigated in a
   situation of strong local advection. To this end, an analysis has been
   made of data from the 1987 field experiment in `la Crau' (France), where
   an extensive dry terrain with sparse vegetation was situated upwind from
   an irrigated field completely covered with grass. The change in surface
   roughness was negligible, the main effect being a change in surface heat
   flux. In the experiment, turbulence measurements were made of horizontal
   and vertical wind speed, temperature and humidity at various locations
   over both terrains. In this study, 12 runs of 1 h are analysed, roughly
   half of which were made when an advective inversion was present over the
   downstream terrain. Both vertical and horizontal velocity fluctuations
   are almost unaffected by the change in terrain. Temperature fluctuations
   are influenced by the fact that over the downstream terrain production
   of variance almost ceases and advection of variance becomes important.
   This results in a deviation of the sigma(theta)/theta{*} = f(z/L)
   relation found for homogeneous situations. Also, the temperature spectra
   of the unstable runs are affected, showing a different inertial subrange
   roll-off rate. Humidity fluctuations adjust rapidly to the new surface
   and, for all but the lowest frequencies, behave as if measured over
   homogeneous terrain.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, models of regional heat and moisture fluxes in terrain with
   bluff roughness elements have been developed, based on observations
   which indicate that small areas of large roughness or obstacles dominate
   the regional momentum flux, whereas the regional heat and moisture
   fluxes are determined by the dominant surface cover. One model (Claussen
   and Klaassen, Beitr. Phys. Atmos., 65, 243-248, 1992) deduces the
   regional heat and moisture fluxes from local surface parameters, whereas
   the other (Beljaars and Holtslag, J. Appl. Meteorol., 30, 327-341, 1991)
   uses effective parameters. Here, the two models are compared; it is
   shown that they are equivalent when applied to homogeneous terrain with
   bluff roughness elements. Moreover, they yield the same results when
   used in numerical simulations. Both models are tested against an earlier
   proposal by Brutsaert (Water Resour. Res., 11, 543-550, 1975).}},

Abstract = {{The concept of blending height is known to be applicable to estimate
   areally averaged surface heat and momentum fluxes over heterogeneous
   terrain with horizontal scales of surface variations much smaller than
   10 km. Here, the performance of this concept is explored beyond this
   limit of validity. This is accomplished by analysing a three-dimensional
   meso-scale simulation of land-sea breeze systems which originate at
   large-scale temperature differences between water and land surfaces and
   by employing a one-dimensional version of the meso-scale model as a
   vertical column of a hypothesized macro-scale model. It appears that
   areally averaged surface fluxes can be reproduced reasonably well. This
   is valid for area-averaged fluxes obtained by the average of surface
   fluxes on each land type, i.e. for so-called flux aggregation, and for a
   combination of flux aggregation and so-called parameter aggregation
   where similar land types are combined into an aggregated land surface.
   The weak dependence of averaged surface fluxes on secondary, meso-scale
   motions agrees with earlier theoretical considerations.}},

Abstract = {{Results from a case study of heat and moisture transport in the
   atmospheric boundary layer during the European Field Experiment in a
   Desertification-threatened Area (EFEDA) are presented. The experimental
   area is heterogeneous in respect of soil moisture and vegetation on
   scales of several tens of kilometres. An instrumented aircraft flew
   repeatedly at two different altitudes along two long flight tracks
   (legs) over regions with different surface properties. Vertical profiles
   of heat and moisture fluxes were calculated for these legs (west and
   south) for two flights, one at noon and the other in the late afternoon.
   Evaporation from the western surface seems to exceed that from the
   southern. The flux profiles over these terrains with different surface
   characteristics show significant differences throughout the mixed layer.
   Thermodynamic partitioning of sensible and latent heat fluxes explains
   these differences. The development of the mixed layer differs
   significantly from the `ideal' case (a mixed layer of constant thickness
   existing throughout the afternoon); it reaches its full height only in
   the late afternoon. Reduced incoming solar radiation owing to cirrus
   cloud cover, as well as properties of the residual layer, seem to be
   responsible for this.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with occult precipitation as a process affecting the
   water balance and chemistry. The methods used in assessing the fog-water
   amount are discussed. A micrometeorological mathematical resistance
   model predicted annual gross deposition of cloudwater of 81 mm year(-1)
   in the Sumava Mts. (South Bohemia); the net deposition was 47 mm
   year(-1). Chemical analyses of occult precipitation (fog- and
   cloud-water, rime-water) both in the Sumava Mts. (Czech Republic) and in
   the Taunus Mts. (Germany) were made. Cloud- and fog-water samples were
   collected using active cloud-water collectors installed on the tops of
   the Sumava and the Taunus Mts. Altogether, 54 samples of cloud- and
   fog-water and 45 samples of rime-water were collected and analysed.
   Concentrations of the major ions were significantly higher in occult
   precipitation than in rain-water. Enrichment factors for cloud vs. rain
   varied from two to 32. In the Sumava Mts. the estimated. wet deposition
   for NH4+, NO3- and SO42- via cloud droplet impaction and sedimentation
   represents 1410 kg km(-2) year(-1), 2650 kg km(-2) year(-1) and 2508 kg

Abstract = {{The importance of surface hydrological processes on land
   surface-atmospheric fluxes is currently a major topic of investigation.
   It has been shown that the division of available energy into latent and
   sensible heat is sensitive to the prevailing hydrological conditions.
   Planetary boundary layer development is indicative of the amount of
   sensible heat being supplied to the lower atmosphere. Feedback
   mechanisms imposed by the boundary layer on the evaporative potential
   near the surface are also important. This paper uses a simple slab
   planetary boundary layer (PBL) model to show how PBL development is
   affected under a range of hydrological model scenarios. The
   investigation commences using a one-dimensional, single soil moisture
   root zone store model, which will represent the hydrological
   representation seen in current SVAT (soil-vegetation-atmosphere
   transfer) models. This model is the benchmark against which more complex
   models are tested and is also used to show the sensitivity of the PBL
   model to antecedent soil moisture conditions. A further level of
   complexity is added using the topographically derived distribution
   function model TOPMODEL, TOPMODEL introduces a water table that
   interacts with the root zone stores. The role of laterally redistributed
   water within a catchment or grid cell on the PBL is demonstrated; under
   certain circumstances, a spatially varying water table can substantially
   change the development of the PBL, A distribution function structure
   model showing a hydrological structure that includes spatially varying
   available water capacity (AWC) is also described. It is shown that the
   PBL development is sensitive to the spatial variability of available
   water and so can be highly dependent on the hydrological scenario at the
   land surface.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the attempts to derive surface soil moisture
   information for two catchments under different climates in Europe based
   on active microwave remote sensing techniques and conceptual
   hydrological modelling. The two catchments were selected as test sites
   during the MAC-EUROPE'91 campaign. The first catchment, Slapton Wood, is
   situated in south-west England. The second catchment, Virginiolo, is
   situated in Tuscany, Italy. For both sites, multitemporal full
   polarimetric AIRSAR (C-, L- and P-band) data are available for the
   summer of 1991. Based on ground-truth data collected during the flights,
   simple SAR-soil moisture relationships are established, This allows the
   estimation of the spatial variation of surface soil moisture at the
   field scale. From hydrological and meteorological data acquired during
   the experiment, a conceptual water and energy balance model was
   calibrated. Simulation results for soil moisture are then compared with
   SAR-based soil moisture estimates. The comparison between sampled,
   modelled and SAR-derived soil moisture at the transect scale is
   acceptable, but the spatial patterns of soil moisture predicted by the
   conceptual model and the SAR images are different owing to the influence
   of vegetation. The results are also useful in pointing out some of the
   major problems encountered in the application of SAR data at the
   catchment scale.}},

Abstract = {{Because of topographic variability, the global flux of incoming direct
   solar radiation over a drainage basin of high relief should be evaluated
   by grid modelling. Alternatively, line integration throughout the
   catchment boundary can be substituted for areal integration over the
   detailed three-dimensional representation of basin topography. This
   method is based on the Stokes' theorem and it yields a general and
   efficient solution, which can also account for shadowing effects,
   Application to three small mountainous catchments is reported for
   varying solar geometry and the performance of a lumped model is also
   examined. The approach can be applied to estimate the contribution of
   shortwave radiative fluxes to the processes of snowmelt and
   evapotranspiration at the basin scale.}},

   ANALYSIS}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{166}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Existing titration-based methods for the measurement of dissolved free
   CO2 are indirect and require the measurement of a number of other
   determinands (e.g. pH); they may underestimate free CO2 concentrations,
   because analysis is carried out frequently in an open vessel from which
   some free CO2 may be lost prior to measurement.  Here, a method of
   head-space analysis is described; this minimises CO2 loss and provides a
   more direct technique for determining free CO2 in low ionic strength,
   organic-rich upland streamwaters.  A sample of streamwater is collected
   in a sealed flask and a headspace is created by pumping out a known
   volume of sample, replacing it with CO2-scrubbed air.  After
   equilibration of CO2 between the remaining water and the headspace, the
   concentration of in the headspace is measured using an Infra Red Gas
   Analyser.  The concentration of free CO2 in the original sample is then
   calculated using Henry's law.  This method measured free CO2 in standard
   solutions containing 1-10 mg 1-1 free CO2 to within 0.1 mg l-1.  The
   method was used to measure free CO2 in streamwater from 19 sites on the
   River Dee in north-east Scotland and the results were compared with
   those reported for streams elsewhere.  Free CO2 concentrations measured
   by headspace analysis were significantly higher than those found using
   acidimetric titration.}},

Abstract = {{Soil solution and free-flowing soilwater were sampled at various depths
   for 3 years in a plot of holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) in the Montseny
   mountains (NE Spain).  The soil solution retained at -65M kPa in the
   mineral soil at depths of 20 and 40 cm had a different chemistry from
   that of throughflow under the humic layer (H-layer throughflow) and, to
   a lesser extent, from deep subsurface flow.  The dominant mobile anion
   in the soil solution and the deep flow was SO4(2-), whereas in the
   H-layer, SO4(2-) was overridden by alkalinity.
   H-Layer throughflow chemistry was extremely variable, in consequence of
   the large number of biogeochemical processes affecting it (e.g. rainfall
   chemistry, dry deposition, leaching from canopy and litter,
   decomposition), and of the quantity of water available for transport of
   solutes.  The chemistry of the soil solution was more predictable, as it
   was governed mainly by nutrient uptake, cation exchange reactions and
   the seasonal wetting and drying cycles.  The chemistry of the deep
   subsurface flow was often intermediate between that of the soil solution
   and that of the H-layer throughflow; this suggested a mixture of
   displaced pre-event soil solution and of H-layer throughflow circulating
   through preferential flow paths.  With humid antecedent conditions, the
   chemistry of the deep subsurface flow approached that of the soil
   solution.
   The cation concentration relationships in the soil solution were
   strongly linear.  In a homogeneous soil, cation exchange theory predicts
   this to be expected only for cations of the same charge, whereas cations
   of different charges should follow power relationships.  Our results,
   however, are consistent with a theoretical approach involving cation
   exchange reactions in a highly heterogeneous environment.  Indeed, our
   study illustrates the heterogeneous nature of the soils, as the power
   relationship has been obscured completely.
   Soilwater chemistries were markedly different from those of streamwater,
   particularly under dry conditions.  During baseflow, the stream is fed
   by groundwater, and the soils are probably disconnected from the stream.
   During humid periods, the chemistry of the streamwater tends toward that
   of the deep subsurface flow.  Chemical hydrograph separation indicates
   that, on average, stormflow water comprises an approximately one to one
   mixture of groundwater and deep subsurface flow.}},

   (3-6-dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid), and 2,4-D
   (2,4-dichlorophenoxy-acetic acid) move through claypan soils (fine
   montmorillonitic, mesic Udollic Ochraqualf Mollic albaqualf, Mexico
   silty loam) at the Missouri Management System Evaluation Area (MSEA)
   near Centralia in Boone County, Missouri, and the role of preferential
   flowpaths in that movement.  Twelve intact soil cores (30 cm diameter by
   40 cm height), were excavated sequentially, four from each of the
   following depths:  0-40 cm, 40-80 cm, and 80-120 cm.  These cores were
   used to study preferential flow characteristics using dye staining
   experiments and to determine hydraulic properties.  Six undisturbed
   experimental field plots, with a 1 m2 surface area (two sets of three
   each), were instrumented at the Missouri MSEA on 11 May 1991:  1 m2
   zero-tension pan lysimeters were installed at 1.35 m depths in Plots 1-3
   and at 1.05 m depths in Plots 4-6.  Additionally, each plot was planted
   with soybeans (Glycine max L.) and instrumented with suction lysimeters
   and tensiometers at 15 cm depth increments.  A neutron probe access tube
   was installed in each plot to determine soil water content at 15 cm
   intervals.  All plots were enclosed with a raised frame (of 8 cm height)
   to prevent surface runoff, and were allowed to equilibrate for a year
   before data collection.  During this waiting period, all suction and pan
   lysimeters were purged monthly and were sampled immediately prior to
   herbicide application in May 1992 to obtain background concentrations. 
   Atrazine, 2,4-D, and dicamba moved rapidly through the soil, probably
   owing to the presence of preferential flowpaths.  Staining of laboratory
   cores showed a positive correlation between the per cent area stained by
   depth and the subsequent breakthrough of Br- in the laboratory and
   leaching of field-applied herbicides owing to large rainfall events. 
   Suction lysimeter samples in the field showed increases in
   concentrations of herbicides at depths were laboratory data indicated
   greater percentages of what appeared to be preferential flowpaths. 
   Concentrations of atrazine, 2,4-D, and dicamba exceeding 0.50, 0.1, and
   0.15 mug ml-1 were observed with depth (45-135 cm, 60-125 cm and 60-135
   cm) after several months following rainfall events.  Preferential
   flowpaths were a major factor in transport of atrazine, 2,4-D, and
   dicamba at the site.}},

Abstract = {{The major ion chemistry of samples from 216 headwater streams in the
   Everest, Annapurna, Langtang and Nuwakot regions of the middle and high
   mountains of the Nepal Himalayas is described.  Samples were collected
   at low flow during February-March 1992, the dry season between the
   winter and summer monsoon periods.  The resulting database provides a
   baseline against which to assess natural and anthropogenic influences on
   water chemistry in these environments.
   Differences in bedrock geology generally determine differences in
   chemical characteristics between the four regions.  Ion concentrations
   tend to decrease with altitude, reflecting differences in land use, land
   management, natural vegetation and atmospheric deposition, all of which
   are correlated with altitude.  The well buffered nature of the pristine,
   high altitude streams indicates that increased atmospheric deposition of
   S and N compounds is unlikely to cause acidification of streamwater,
   although these systems currently leak low concentrations of NO3.
   Terraced agriculture contributes significantly to differences in
   chemistry both between and within regions.  Water draining agricultural
   catchments has higher concentrations of nutrients (NO3, PO4) and acid
   anions (Cl, SO4), probably as a result of mineral fertiliser inputs and
   of trace metals (Fe, Al, Ba, Sr, Mn) Si and F, potentially due to
   increased weathering.}},

Abstract = {{Homogeneity tests are an important component of many regional flood
   frequency analysis methods, particularly index flood methods.  The index
   method was first suggested by Dalrymple, who also proposed a homogeneity
   test.  Dalrymple's test has been widely used in hydrologic practice for
   more then 30 years.  This paper analyzes the relative performance of
   Dalrymple's test, a normalized quantile test based upon L-moment
   parameter estimation (X-10 test), and a method of moment Cv test (MoM-Cv
   test).   Dalrymple's original test is shown to be in error and a
   corrected version is developed.  A Monte Carlo study compares the power
   of these three tests, after applying correction factors to the test
   statistics to achieve a 5\% Type I error.  The L-moment X-10 test was
   always more powerful then Dalrymple's test or the MoM-Cv test. 
   Moreover, the X-10 test needs much less correction to achieve the
   specified Type I error.  An analytical analysis of the power of the test
   is consistent with the Monte Carlo results.  The superior performance of
   the X-10 test is due to its L-moment estimation procedure, which yields
   a smaller sampling variance and a sampling distribution closer to
   normality than classical product moments.  The relationship of the X-10
   test with other L-moment based tests proposed by other workers is
   discussed.  The original version of Dalrymple's test should not be used.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of climate change on the water balance of Scots pine were
   studied with a coupled water and heat flow model called `SOIL'.  Two
   forest soil types (a silty-sand and a sand) at five locations in Sweden
   were chosen to represent sites with different air temperature, growing
   season length and precipitation excess.  The simulated water balance for
   the period 1961-1987 was compared with those simulated with two climate
   change scenario schemes:  one is based on increased temperature and the
   other on both increased temperature and increased precipitation. 
   Different assumptions regarding the effects of changes in leaf area
   index and minimum canopy resistance on transpiration were studied.
   Water stress increased substantially in the scenarios based on increased
   temperature only, which prevented transpiration from increasing.  But
   with scenarios based on simultaneous changes in temperature and
   precipitation, water stress increased mainly during spring and
   transpiration increased by 50 mm and 100 mm in northern and southern
   Sweden, respectively, i.e. by 30-50\%.  When simultaneous changes in
   climate and stand characteristics were assumed, transpiration increased
   by 30-70\% with the relative change being greatest for northern Sweden. 
   Differences in water balance the locations and soil types were less
   pronounced in the climate change scenarios than in the present climate
   scenario.}},

Abstract = {{The flowmeter test is analytically and numerically evaluated for its
   applicability to three-layer aquifers.  A root finding procedure is used
   to determine the hydraulic conductivity.  The emphasis is on the
   significance of the skin effect in estimations of hydraulic
   conductivity.  The analysis shows that the flowmeter test produces an
   insignificant error in a quasi-steady state with a perfect borehole
   (without a disturbed zone around the borehole), but the skin effect,
   caused by a disturbed zone, may seriously impact the estimated hydraulic
   conductivities of individual layers.  The relative error of the
   estimated hydraulic conductivity for each layer is a function of errors
   in estimating the equivalent conductivity and in determining flow for
   the corresponding layer.  The derived relative error expression for the
   estimated equivalent conductivity shows that this relative error depends
   on the hydraulic conductivity and the radius of the disturbed zone. 
   When the conductivity of the disturbed zone is significantly different
   from that of the estimated layers, the relative error in the estimated
   equivalent conductivity of the aquifer may be up to 90\% at early time
   of the flowmeter test.  If the error in flow is counted, the relative
   error of individual layers will be larger.}},

Abstract = {{The Koycegiz Lake in south-western Turkey is a meromictic lake,
   comprised of waters of both thermal and cold-karstic origin.  The lake
   is principally fed from surface flow, ground water recharge from
   alluvium and thermal discharges located at the bottom of the lake.  As
   indicated by physical and chemical observations, the lake is composed of
   two hydrochemically distinct water layers.  There is a transition zone
   between these two layers at a depth of approximately 10 m.  The bottom
   layer, which contains more mineralized water, is recognized easily by
   the smell of hydrogen sulfide gas.  A decrease in pH and dissolved
   oxygen and an increase in specific conductivity and ionic constituents
   are observed at the transition zone in depth profiles at all measurement
   sites throughout the year.  The isotopic compositions of the
   representative observation points widely scatter and indicate the mixing
   of thermal and cold-karstic waters.  As indicated by satellite imagery
   data, the morphology of the lake shores are primarily controlled by
   structural elements, which are mostly normal faults.  Echo-sounding
   profiles point out that some of the fault lines, along which the lake
   bottom springs seem to be located, extend through the lake bottom. 
   Current velocity observations also indicate possible sites of thermal
   ground water discharges located at the lake bottom.}},

Abstract = {{The universal type curves for mass transport in radial flow established
   numerically by Sauty in 1978 have been modified in this paper by using
   different boundary conditions of high accuracy. The method to determine
   the hydrodispersive parameters by interpretation of tracer experiments
   in radial flow using modified approximate analytical solutions is simple
   and accurate. It is shown that the approximate analytical solutions can
   be applied to mass transport in radial Bow thanks to the introduction of
   correction factors, although there are large differences between the
   approximate analytical solutions and numerical solutions for radial flow
   in certain cases. The correction factors are derived from comparison of
   the above two solutions.
   For each case, a verification of this method has been performed by
   interpretation of numerical data using the approach formulae with the
   help of estimated correction factors.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater occurs in all climatic zones and differs in hydrodynamic,
   isotopic and chemical terms according to its activity within the water
   cycle and its interaction with rocks. Among the many chemical components
   in groundwaters, tritium concentrations allow differentiation between
   groundwater of high and low mobility and thus permit the distinction
   between shallow and deep groundwaters. In Germany shallow groundwaters
   range in depth between IO and 100 m and account for more than 85\% of
   groundwater recharge. Deep groundwaters, in contrast, participate in the
   water cycle only at intervals of hundreds or thousands of years and
   reach depths of several hundred metres. Both types of groundwater
   overlie connate waters that have been isolated from the water cycle
   since the accumulation of the sediments in which they occur.
   The exploitation of deep groundwaters mostly causes long-term
   non-steady-state conditions, large-scale changes of flow patterns of the
   groundwaters and hydraulic short circuits to shallow aquifers. Thus,
   persistent contaminants may penetrate extraction wells in deep
   groundwaters even if the wells are believed to be well protected against
   pollution. In deep groundwaters it is difficult to apply the
   conventional use of groundwater protection zones to prevent this kind of
   intrusion of contaminants.}},

   PERMO-TRIASSIC SANDSTONE AQUIFER, UK}},

Abstract = {{Saline groundwater occurs at depth in the Triassic Sandstones of the
   northern end of the Cheshire Basin in northwest England. Major and minor
   ion data suggest that the origin of the salinity is dissolution of
   evaporite deposits; the salinity probably developed in an interval
   following the Tertiary inversion of the Basin which would have allowed
   faulted contact between the sandstones and the overlying evaporite
   sequence of the Mercia Mudstone Group. Isotope evidence suggests the
   saline waters to have been considerably diluted by presumably dispersive
   mixing with a meteoric water recharged under cool, and therefore
   Quaternary, climatic conditions. Comparison with other UK Permo-Triassic
   Basin brines suggests the Merseyside waters are not unusual, except in
   terms of the importance of exchange reactions and dilution by Quaternary
   recharge waters. These factors are due to the shallow maximum burial
   depth of the aquifer and the preservation of smectites, and also to the
   geometry of the acquifer and its low-permeability faults. In the light
   of the water chemistry data it is suggested, in a slight modification of
   the proposal of Naylor et al. (J. Geol. Sec. Lend., 146: 685-699, 1988),
   that the Cheshire Basin mineralization resulted from mixing of the
   relatively oxidized, SO4-rich evaporite brines with the reduced,
   SO4-poor, metal-rich, Ba-rich Coal Measures brines which were expelled
   through faults from the Coal Measures during Basin inversion: some
   degree of oxyhydroxide-stripping of the sandstones by the Coal Measures
   brines would have enhanced metal concentrations. The water resulting
   from the mixing of brines would have been far from equilibrium, and the
   barite and sulphide precipitation followed along the faults.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater quality modelling relies heavily on the knowledge of
   preferential flowpaths such as buried stream channels and their
   distribution within the aquifer. This paper examines the extent to which
   these patterns may be identified by including auxiliary data, such as
   transverse electric resistances or specific capacities, when estimating
   the transmissivity field. The analyses are based on two hypothetical
   aquifers. The first involves a high transmissivity flowpath. The second
   is a realization of a correlated random field with the same spatial
   moments as the organised case. Monte Carlo simulations and cokriging
   estimates are used to analyse the effect of the number of samples and
   their correlation with transmissivity on the width of the capture zone
   of a well. Results indicate that, in the organised case with no
   auxiliary information, the estimated widths are substantially biased.
   This bias can be reduced significantly by including auxiliary data, even
   when poorly correlated to transmissivity. Auxiliary data also reduce the
   scatter (i.e. standard deviation) of the estimated widths significantly,
   which is a measure of the accuracy of the estimates. In the example used
   here, 70 samples of auxiliary data, which are correlated to
   transmissivity by r = 0.6, outweigh the information from 12 additional
   pumping tests. For the case of the correlated random held, the benefit
   of using auxiliary data is much less pronounced both in terms of
   removing the bias and in terms of accuracy (i.e. standard deviation). It
   is concluded that auxiliary data are useful for estimating
   transmissivity fields in the context of groundwater quality modelling,
   particularly when channelised how is to be expected.}},

Abstract = {{The hydro-electric power plant (HEPP) which will exclusively use water
   from a karst underground storage basin will be built in the vicinity of
   the abundant karst spring Ombla in Croatia. This paper presents the
   results obtained by hydrogeologic, hydrologic and hydraulic
   investigations related to the principles of ground water circulation in
   the karst. The analyses included the determination of the effective
   porosity n(e) of the karst aquifer and the definition of the volume of
   large conduits and small fractures in the karst which form the aquifer
   volume. The position and dimensions of large karst conduits have also
   been defined. It was established that in three small springs, Zaton,
   Zavrelje and Slavljan, water overflows from the Ombla Spring in periods
   of high ground water levels, It was also discovered that at certain
   periods the Dupuit expression for steady-state flow in an unconfined
   aquifer can be used. In accordance with this, it was possible to
   determine the values of hydraulic conductivity, K (in m s(-1)), for the
   Ombla aquifer. They range from 2 x 10(-3) to 5 x 10(-3) m s(-1) and are
   inversely proportional to the Ombla Spring discharge. Continuous
   measurements of the ground water level by several piezometers located in
   the karst hinterland of the Ombla Spring and simultaneous measurement of
   the discharge made it possible to define discharge curves of the Ombla
   Spring dependent upon the ground water levels at Various locations.
   Characteristic features of the discharge curves made the identification
   of the position and dimensions of the main karst conduits possible.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology is proposed for using information from daily hydrological
   records in rainfall-runoff models that operate on time bases much
   shorter than a day. First, the calibration problem is tackled.
   Parameters of the model runoff generating component or production
   function are identified on a long series of daily data and then are
   adjusted effectively to the final subdaily time step. The transfer
   function component is estimated independently through the FDTF-ERUHDIT
   method based on limited event-based data on the final time step. The two
   functions are then brought together to form a new model, the derived
   model. Subsequently, the latter model is used in an operational context
   only in flood periods after it has been initialised through the daily
   model and some of its state variables have been tuned. The methodology
   for both model calibration and initialisation is evaluated and compared
   with the direct calibration and use of continuous-time models, Two
   well-known conceptual rainfall-runoff models (SACRAMENTO and TANK) are
   tested within a framework that is set up on real-world data from a Creek
   basin. The methodology proposed proved very efficient for model
   calibration on the basis of inappropriate data sets that comprise long
   daily observations and continuous charts for only some flood events.
   This commonly appears in the planning phase of a flood forecasting
   system. Also, an effective method for model initialisation is proposed
   that is useful in real-time flood forecasting.}},

   and the associated groundwater interception scheme has been modelled in
   cross-section using the SUTRA model, Recharge from irrigation areas, and
   saline seepage from the lake have been taken into account. Owing to the
   salinity contrast between Lake Ranfurly West and groundwater, it was
   considered appropriate to simulate density-dependent flow behaviour.
   concentration profiles in the aquifers and salt loads to the river under
   various management scenarios were computed under conditions of both
   density-dependent and non-density-dependent flow. The model simulations
   have shown that the salt load to the river is (1) dependent on the rate
   of pumping from interception bores, (2) dependent on the aquifer(s) in
   which groundwater is intercepted, and (3) marginally greater (11-15\%)
   for density-dependent flow behaviour at less than full interception
   compared with calculations which neglect density-dependent flow.}},

Abstract = {{A long series of thermo-saline logging has been carried out in wells
   drilled through the Mesozoic carbonate aquifer from which the sulfur
   hypothermal springs of S. Cesarea Terme issue. The logging conducted at
   various timings (i.e. periodically, rapidly sequenced, synchronized with
   tides and sea conditions), over about 10 years, provides valuable data
   on the thermal and hydrological regimen of the area. In particular for
   the inshore zone, both isotherm and thermal gradient trends could be
   determined, and a close identification of preferential levels through
   which groundwater discharge takes place was possible. In fact, flow
   velocity measurements, made by the point diluition method, showed a
   mostly impervious aquifer except for evident fissured levels through
   which low-velocity discharge (5-22cm day(-1)) takes place. When the sea
   is low and calm, all levels are influenced by sulfur waters except for
   the uppermost unconfined zone. When the sea is rough, also owing to the
   low permeability of the aquifer, a barrier effect against groundwater
   flow is triggered. Since groundwater is prevented from discharging, it
   tends to reach deeper permeable levels, thus markedly altering the
   hydrological and thermal regimen of the deeper sulfur waters.
   The lithological character of aquifers and their low permeability are
   confirmed by Rn-222 contents (normally 10-15 pCil(-1)), groundwater
   reaching 200 pCil(-1) only at levels where water starts becoming hot.
   This phenomenon, as supported by all investigations including those on
   sulfides, occurs only at temperatures exceeding 23 degrees C. Therefore,
   according to the above investigation, the S. Cesarea springs represent a
   unique hydraulic model, matching real hydrodynamic situations occurring
   when surrounding conditions change.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has revealed that natural soil pipes provide important
   pathways for subsurface movement of water and solutes, as well as
   contributing to landslide initiation. A bench-scale experiment (in a
   sloping box 1 m in length) was conducted with a uniform sand to evaluate
   the effect of pipeflow on the overall hydrologic regime. A single
   drainage pipe (13 mm inside diameter (ID)) composed of five 20 cm
   segments, each with a different roughness coefficient (Manning's n), was
   placed 5 cm above the base of the 12.8 degrees sloping box. Roughness
   elements were arranged in four different spatial combinations during
   hydraulic experiments. Piezometric levels were highest and pipeflow was
   lowest when the high-roughness (n = 0.325) portion of the pipe was
   located at the downslope end of the box. Measured values of pipeflow for
   different hydraulic gradients in each experiment were related to
   piezometric head above the pipe raised to the 0.32-0.42 power. Pipeflow
   was proportional to matrix flow in the soil above the pipe raised to the
   power of 0.4-0.6. These findings may be useful in estimating pipeflow in
   uniform soils and in validating two-domain models involving preferential
   flow in soils.}},

Abstract = {{Runoff from intertropical glaciers is highly variable, indicating that
   they are greatly affected by climatic changes peculiar to tropical
   climates, The 3 km(2) basin presented in this case study lies in the
   Cordillera Real of Bolivia and is 77\% covered by glacier ice, ranging
   in elevation from 6000 to 4830 m a.s.l. A comparison of 2 years of study
   demonstrates the peculiar feature of intertropical glaciers: that
   accumulation and melting periods coincide during the rainy season.
   During the first hydrological year (1991-1992), runoff was 1793 mm for
   an average precipitation on the glacier of approximately 916 mm. During
   the second year (1992-1993), runoff was 1080 mm for a precipitation of
   1060 mm. solar radiation and daily mean duration with positive
   temperature on the ablation zone are the parameters best explaining
   Variation in monthly runoff, Gauge readings taken downstream enable
   discharge from the glacier to be established over a period of nearly 20
   years. The most prominent events coincide with significantly negative
   values of the Southern Oscillation Index, often linked to El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena. In conclusion, results show
   that these intertropical glaciers are receding rapidly, as precipitation
   does not compensate for loss from melting.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave remote sensing allows the measurement of the water content
   (theta(s)) at the soil surface within a layer of a few centimetres. When
   combined with climatic data, theta(s) is a relevant quantity to estimate
   the evaporation of bare soils. The implementation of a simple daily
   evaporation (E(d)) model on bare soils based on a knowledge of theta(s)
   is analysed. In order to cover a wide range of soil, soil moisture and
   climatic conditions, the analysis was carried out on a set of data
   simulated by a mechanistic model of heat and water hows in the soil.
   Propagation error analysis on the inputs (theta(s), daily potential
   evaporation and wind velocity) of the simple model shows that an
   accuracy of +/- 1.5 mm day(-1) (95\% confidence interval) may be
   expected when theta(s) is observed from space-borne microwave sensors.
   This accuracy is significantly improved (+/-0.6 mm day(-1)) if E(d) is
   averaged over a 5 day period. With the simple evaporation model
   considered, the time interval between microwave observations should not
   exceed 3 days. However, if the precipitation amounts were known, this
   time interval could reach 5 days. The soil hydrodynamic properties are
   included in the simple evaporation model through empirical parameters,
   which depend strongly on the soil type. We show that the complementarity
   between thermal infrared and microwave observations could be used to
   infer the empirical parameters of the simple evaporation model. When
   microwave and infrared observations are available for the same day, we
   can inverse the simple evaporation to retrieve its parameters. Even with
   important errors on the input quantities, the proposed inversion method
   allows good discrimination between soils. Furthermore, the performances
   in the estimation of the evaporation are little affected when the simple
   model is implemented with the retrieved parameters.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model has been developed to study the cotransport of
   contaminants with colloids in saturated rock fractures. The contaminant
   is assumed to decay, and sorb on to fracture surfaces and on to
   colloidal particles, as well as to diffuse into the rock matrix;
   whereas, colloids are envisioned to deposit irreversibly on to fracture
   surfaces without penetration into the rock matrix. The governing
   one-dimensional equations describing the contaminant and the colloid
   transport in the fracture, colloid deposition on to fracture surfaces,
   and contaminant diffusion into the rock matrix are coupled. This
   coupling is accomplished by assuming that the amount of contaminant mass
   captured by colloidal particles in solution and the amount captured by
   deposited colloids on fracture surfaces are described by modified
   Freundlich reversible equilibrium sorption relationships, and that mass
   transport by diffusion into the rock matrix is a first-order process.
   The contaminant sorption on to fracture surfaces is described by a
   linear equilibrium sorption isotherm, while the deposition of colloids
   is incorporated into the model as a first-order process. The resulting
   coupled contaminant transport non-linear equation is solved numerically
   with the fully implicit finite difference method. The constant
   concentration as well as the constant flux boundary conditions have been
   considered. The impact of the presence of colloids on contaminant
   transport is examined. According to model simulations the results show
   that, depending on the conditions of the physical system considered,
   colloids can increase or decrease the mobility of contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{The assessment of mass and energy fluxes at the
   soil-biosphere-atmosphere interface is a key point for the improvement
   and reliability of climate model predictions. At the local scale,
   numerous models have been developed to predict surface fluxes, These
   models are generally deterministic and the extension of their results to
   larger scales, such as the catchment scale or the scale of an
   atmospheric or climatic model mesh, is greatly complicated by the large
   variability of surface properties. To address this issue, stochastic
   approaches have been proposed to enable prediction of fluxes in terms of
   probability density functions.
   This paper is concerned with the influence of the spatial variability of
   soil hydraulic properties. This variability is expressed through one
   parameter, the scale factor for which a log-normal distribution is
   assumed. Values of the scale factor, drawn from this distribution, are
   introduced into a unidimensional model, called SiSPAT, which describes
   the soil-plant-atmosphere coupled heat and water transfers. Two land
   uses are considered: a bare soil and a rather densely vegetated one for
   which the same forcing is applied over 7 days. Comparison of the two
   cases shows that the vegetation tends to smooth the influence of the
   spatial variability of soil properties limiting the number of
   observations required to estimate a spatial mean with a prescribed
   degree of accuracy. Comparison of the deterministic and stochastic
   solutions also shows that the former approach leads to a bias for the
   bare soil case, the differences between the two being almost negligible
   in the presence of vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{The significance of spatial distribution of rainfall and its effects on
   spatial correlation functions are reviewed. A number of statistical
   terms and properties are explained in depth with reference to the theory
   of variograms originally adopted in geostatistics. This is followed by a
   detailed analysis of theoretical variogram models, effects of
   meteorological, orographic, and space-time aggregation scales and a
   discussion on network design, areal mean calculations and storm
   velocities. Empirical variogram and validation techniques are then
   examined. Some applications to two different parts of Lombardia (the
   mountainous Valtellina catchment and a large part of the flat area of
   the region) in northern Italy are given with a discussion of the
   results.
   In the Appendix, the technique of kriging is explained with reference to
   the estimation of the spatial distribution of the random rainfall field.}},

Abstract = {{Recession analysis is a well-known tool in hydrological analysis. Its
   application, however, poses many methodical questions, and throughout
   the literature numerous solutions have been sought. The quantification
   of the recession curve involves the selection of an analytical
   expression, derivation of a characteristic recession and optimization of
   the recession parameters. A major problem is the high variability
   encountered in the recession behaviour of individual segments. The
   segments represent different stages in the out-Bow process, and a
   physically based short-term or seasonal influence on the recession rate
   adds to the problem of deriving a characteristic recession. This paper
   discusses these elements of recression analysis and reviews different
   ways of characterizing the baseflow recession rate.}},

Abstract = {{Water retention times in the Finger Lakes, a group of 11 lakes in
   central New York with similar hydrologic and climatic characteristics,
   were estimated by use of a tritium-balance model. During July 1991,
   samples were collected from the 11 lakes and selected tributary streams
   and were analyzed for tritium, deuterium, and oxygen-18. Additional
   samples from some of the sites were collected in 1990, 1992 and 1993.
   Tritium concentration in lake water ranged from 24.6 Tritium Units (TU)
   (Otisco Lake) to 43.2 TU (Seneca Lake). The parameters in the model used
   to obtain water retention time (WRT) included relative humidity,
   evaporation rate, tritium concentrations of inflowing water and lake
   water, and WRT of the lake. A historical record of tritium
   concentrations in precipitation and runoff was obtained from rainfall
   data at Ottawa, Canada, analyses of local wines produced during
   1977-1991, and streamflow samples collected in 1990-1991. The model was
   simulated in yearly steps for 1953-1991, and the WRT was varied to
   reproduce tritium concentrations measured in each lake in 1991. Water
   retention times obtained from model simulations ranged from 1 year for
   Otisco Lake to 12 years for Seneca Lake, and with the exception of
   Seneca Lake and Skaneateles Lake, were in agreement with earlier
   estimates obtained from runoff estimates and chloride balances. The
   sensitivity of the model to parameter changes was tested to determine
   possible reasons for the differences calculated for WRT's for Seneca
   Lake and Skaneateles Lake, The shorter WRT obtained from tritium data
   for Lake Seneca (12 years as compared to 18 years) can be explained by a
   yearly addition of less than 3\% by lake volume of ground water to the
   lake, the exact percentage depending on tritium concentration in the
   ground water.}},

Abstract = {{Distributions of freshwater hydraulic heads have been, and continue to
   be, used in the representation and analysis of groundwater flow,
   including the flow of variable-properties formation water in deep
   sloping aquifers. Because of variations in pressure, temperature and
   salinity, the flow of formation waters in sedimentary basins is driven
   by potential forces resulting from pressure and elevation (topography)
   differences, by buoyancy resulting from density differences, and by
   osmosis caused by temperature and concentration gradients. Because of
   variations in both fluid and rock properties, it is not possible to
   define a flow potential to be used in representing and analysing the
   flow. Neither is there a force potential from which a flow-driving force
   can be derived, and which could be used in flow representation and
   analysis. Even if osmotic effects are neglected, buoyancy still plays a
   role which in certain cases may be important. In horizontal or
   near-horizontal aquifers, the lateral flow of variable-density water is
   correctly represented by freshwater potentiometric surfaces, and the
   vertical flow may be analysed using `environmental' hydraulic-head
   distributions. However, the flow of formation waters in sedimentary
   basins is mostly along bedding in confined sloping aquifers. In this
   case, short of calculating and representing either the velocity or the
   impelling force distribution, freshwater hydraulic heads remain the only
   tool available for representing and analysing the flow. By neglecting
   buoyancy, errors in flow strength and direction are introduced, which
   become significant if a dimensionless driving force ratio exceeds a
   threshold value estimated to be around 0.5. The review of representation
   and analysis methods for the flow of variable-properties formation water
   in deep sloping aquifers is illustrated with two case studies from the
   Alberta and Llanos sedimentary basins.}},

Abstract = {{The speciation of aluminium in an acidic stream, draining a spruce
   plantation-forest in Mid-Wales, is examined using an established model
   based on an equilibrium thermodynamic approach. Trivalent aluminium and
   aluminium complexes with fluoride, with dissolved organic matter and
   with silica were abundant: aluminium hydroxy-fluorides and sulphates
   were much less so. There is a large scatter in the results, primarily
   due to variations in stream water chemistry at a given pH, rather than
   to an effect of temperature. It is concluded that aluminium silica
   complexes can be an important part of the total dissolved aluminium
   concentration: at pHs > 5, they comprise typically 20\% of the total
   dissolved aluminium in the stream water.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we apply the techniques of sensitivity analysis to the
   Cooper et al. model for slug tests in confined aquifers. A sensitivity
   analysis of slug-test responses can provide valuable information
   concerning optimal test design (within the limitations of the chosen
   model). The sensitivity analysis enables a family of generic sensitivity
   coefficients for transmissivity (T) and storage coefficient (S) to be
   defined by two parameters ct (related to S) and beta (related to time
   and T). Two facts stand out from this family of curves. First, the
   sensitivity to S is much lower than that to T; second, the sensitivity
   curves for T and S are very similar in shape (i.e. the correlation is
   high) making it difficult to reliably estimate both T and S. Sensitivity
   analysis shows that the estimated standard errors of the parameters are
   inversely proportional to the initial head (H-0), so large initial heads
   should be used when possible. Generally, an increased number of
   measurements improves parameter estimation, if properly placed in time.
   Early time measurements are important for defining H-0 accurately. The
   best estimates for T and S are obtained by minimizing the correlation
   between the sensitivity coefficients for rand S and sampling at points
   of maximum sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{An earlier paper (Part 1, this issue) dealt with the use of sensitivity
   analysis for the design of a slug,test that would give reasonably
   accurate estimates of the aquifer parameters by an informed choice of
   the number and times of measurements. An investigation of the radial
   dependence of the Cooper et al. analytical solution for a slug test in a
   confined aquifer shows that the use of one or more observation wells can
   vastly improve the parameter estimates, particularly the estimate of the
   storage parameter. Generally, the observation well must be fairly close
   (about 10 m or less) to the slugged well to be effective. The storage
   coefficient must be small in order to see the effect of the slug at
   greater distances from the stressed well. Since the temporal and spatial
   dependence of the sensitivities for transmissivity and storage are
   considerably different, the addition of one or more observation wells
   will substantially reduce the correlation between these two parameters,
   which will result in much better estimates than are usually obtained in
   slug tests. These ideas are illustrated using typical data
   representative of our research sites.}},

Abstract = {{Upward discharge of fresh groundwater into a mid-Atlantic intertidal
   wetland contributed 62\% of the water needed to replace
   evapotranspiration losses from the sediment during an 11 day period in
   September. Infiltration during flooding by tides provided most of the
   balance; thus there was a net advection of salt into the sediment. The
   amount of groundwater discharge was estimated from changes in water
   storage in the sediment, as inferred from measurements of hydraulic head
   made every 10 min. We argue that this approach is inherently more
   accurate than calculating the flux as the product of hydraulic
   conductivity and head gradient. Evapotranspiration was estimated from
   direct measurements of net radiation. On an annual time-scale, our
   results suggest that groundwater discharge at this site may exceed the
   evapotranspiration flux during months of reduced evapotranspiration.
   Should this occur, groundwater-driven advection would supplement
   diffusion, during flooding, in removing salt from the sediment.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated interactions between sediment physical structure and
   solute transport in an intertidal coastal wetland. Two distinct
   pore-size classes in the sediment were identified. Macropores had
   effective diameters greater than 100 mu m and a normalized volume of
   5\%; matrix pores had effective diameters smaller than 100 mu m and were
   the volumetrically dominant pore-size class (95\%). We found that
   infiltration and evaporation-driven water fluxes were segregated between
   macropores and matrix pores, respectively, which had the effect of
   enhancing diffusive effluxes of chloride from the sediment to surface
   water. Chloride was highly concentrated relative to seawater in matrix
   porewater but was comparatively dilute in macropores. Concentration
   differences in pore-size classes declined with depth until
   indistinguishable below 10 cm. The segregated chloride distribution can
   be explained if recharge to the sediment occurred by downward
   infiltration in macropores and discharge occurred by an upward flux in
   matrix pores to satisfy evapotranspiration. Without disturbance by the
   downward infiltration flux in macropores, upward advection of chloride
   in matrix pores and evapoconcentration increased chloride concentrations
   in matrix pores to a level well above the concentration in seawater. The
   resulting high concentrations of chloride in matrix pores induced a
   large diffusive efflux of chloride into surface water that was
   sufficient to balance new input of chloride by infiltration of seawater
   in macropores (0.085 mmol Cl cm(-2) day(-1)). Transport models that were
   constrained by water balance measurements at the field site explained
   both the exponential form of the vertical distribution of chloride in
   matrix pores and the rate of change in storage of chloride in sediment
   porewater over a 1 month period. We conclude that segregation of water
   and solute fluxes in two pore-size classes strongly influences sediment
   salinity of coastal wetlands, which has direct bearing on primary
   productivity of dominant vegetation and on exchange of dissolved
   nutrients and contaminants between intertidal wetlands and open water.}},

Abstract = {{Sensible heat fluxes measured over a growing wheat crop are used to
   evaluate the performance of the resistance energy balance model for both
   sparse and full canopy covers. Aerodynamic temperatures (for heat and
   momentum) are derived from measured sensible heat fluxes and then
   compared to canopy radiometric temperatures which were measured using
   infra-red radiometers and a pyrgeometer. Agreement between measured
   radiometric and aerodynamic temperatures is excellent for the more
   dense, fully-closed wheat crop, and the resistance energy balance model
   also performed adequately for this canopy. However, very large
   differences between radiometric and aerodynamic temperatures were
   observed for the sparse wheat crop, especially at intermediate leaf area
   indexes (LAIs) (less than 2). Large differences were even found between
   the infra-red radiometer-based and pyrgeometer-based canopy
   temperatures. Under such conditions of sparse canopy cover the model
   performs poorly. At these times greater agreement between aerodynamic
   and canopy temperatures was found when the latter was determined as a
   `composite temperature', combining both infra-red radiometer and
   pyrgeometer measurements. Modelling of sensible heat flux using the
   resistance energy balance model is improved with the use of this
   composite canopy temperature. Measured values for kB(-1) were extremely
   variable and so a unique value for the ratio of roughness lengths for
   heat and momentum could not be determined.}},

Abstract = {{A network design approach developed in this paper identifies monitoring
   sites in multilayered, regional ground water flow systems at risk of
   contamination from waste storage facilities. Candidate locations are
   assigned weights that quantify monitoring value in terms of the prospect
   of plume detection and exposure hazard criteria. Detection criteria are
   based on the location of a site with respect to the source of
   contamination and potential contaminant plumes. Exposure criteria are
   based on the size of the population that consumes water from a supply
   well and the distances between the supply well and probable zones of
   contamination. The weights are used in a binary integer mathematical
   programming problem which selects the monitoring locations. On a
   100-point rating scale developed to quantify composite plume detection
   and characterization efficiency, the network design model scored 87,
   compared with a score of 76 for a pre-existing monitoring network. (The
   model and pre-existing schemes involve the same number of wells.) The
   model selects well sites that are close together near the source of
   contamination, facilitating early detection of a contaminant release,
   and further apart downgradient, resulting in areal coverage for plume
   characterization.}},

Abstract = {{A hydrogeological study was conducted, during the 1991-1992 water year,
   in the clay-soil mantled portion of a limestone terrain in southern
   Indiana. The purpose of the study was to investigate the modes of
   soil-water infiltration contributing to rapid transport of nitrate to
   the saturated zone. The I-year-cycle profiles of nitrate concentration
   vs. time show a consistent increase of nitrate at various depths in the
   unsaturated zone during the period of investigation. The increase of
   nitrate in soil water is attributed to the rapid flushing of the
   inorganic fertilizers from the fields after the area received sufficient
   rainfall in late fall. The investigation also showed a major movement of
   nitrate in quick pulses through the unsaturated zone, rather than a slow
   uniform recharge, immediately after a major storm event. The asymmetric
   profiles of nitrate concentration vs. depth point to the existence of
   preferential flow through macropores in the clay-soil mantle above the
   bedrock. Soil-water transport between storm events is by matrix type
   flow.
   Nitrogen isotopes were analyzed for representative groundwater samples
   collected before and immediately after fertilization of fields in the
   summer, 1991. The delta(15)N values of the samples did not show any
   major shift in nitrate sources between the sampling periods. The summer
   of 1991 was extremely dry prohibiting vertical transport of nitrate from
   the fields to the groundwater system. Any change in nitrate
   concentration in groundwater during this time is attributed to the
   mixing through lateral flow within the aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater in the dolostone aquifers of the Bluff Group
   (Oligocene-Miocene) on Grand Cayman is divided into fresh, lightly and
   highly brackish, and saline (Type I and II) zones according to chemical
   characteristics that were determined during a 3 year (1985-1988)
   monitoring program. Brackish and Type I saline waters display the
   greatest variation in chemical properties whereas the Type II saline
   water has the most stable chemical characteristics. Most groundwaters
   from these dolostone aquifers are thermodynamically capable of
   precipitating calcite and/or dolomite. The saturation indices for these
   minerals, however, vary through time and space even in the context of
   small water lens.
   Simple mixing of fresh and sea water cannot explain the chemistry of the
   water found in the joint and karst controlled dolostone aquifers of
   Grand Cayman. Deviation from a simple mixing model is due to variations
   caused by tidal fluctuation, the rate of rain water recharge, influx of
   Ca-rich groundwater from the surrounding limestone aquifers, influx of
   CO2-rich surface water from sinkholes and swamps, and water-rock
   interactions (dissolution and precipitation of calcite and dolomite).
   Sustained groundwater abstraction from a lens can significantly alter
   the hydrochemistry of the water lens. This suggests that hydrochemical
   characterization of small fresh water lenses, like those on Grand
   Cayman, cannot be based on spot or short-term sampling. Interpretation
   of such fluids in terms of calcite-dolomite precipitation and/or
   dissolution must be treated with caution if the data base has not been
   derived from long-term monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies in soil science literature have strongly indicated the
   need to incorporate pore structures in near-surface mass transport
   modeling. There is increasing evidence suggesting that pore structures,
   such as fractures and macropores, facilitate the transport of water and
   solutes along a preferential flow path while water and solutes are moved
   into micropores and rock matrices concurrently. This study presents a
   conceptual model, a multiple-pore-region (or multi-region) concept, to
   account for pore structures as well as the resultant widely distributed
   pore water velocities in macroporous media. Pore regions can either be
   physically identified as discrete features, such as fractures and rock
   matrices, or be experimentally determined by separation of water
   retention curves according to pore classification schemes. A
   multi-region mechanism is proposed to account for the effect of
   local-scale and field-scale heterogeneities on mass transport under
   variably saturated conditions. Two numerical codes for subsurface fluid
   flow and solute transport have been developed with the multi-region
   concept, in which a first-order mass exchange model is adopted to
   simulate the redistribution of pressure heads and solute concentrations
   among pore regions. The computer codes are used to demonstrate the
   applicability of the concept to fractured porous media, and to test a
   three-pore-region hypothesis using laboratory soil column tracer
   injection data. Based upon the parameters obtained from fitting
   multi-region and mobile-immobile models to these data, we successfully
   demonstrated that the former model has the advantage of maintaining
   consistent conceptual models over the latter under variably saturated
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A set of laboratory column experiments were conducted to study the
   transport of two relatively non-sorptive (Br, NO3) and three sorptive
   (PO4, simazine, linuron) chemicals at three water flux conditions (q =
   6.9, 3.1, 0.62 cm h(-1)) through an unsaturated sand. Special attention
   was paid to the evaluation of the effects of pore-water velocity on
   transport of the chemicals as well as on their adsorption-desorption
   characteristics.
   The breakthrough curves (BTC) for a non-sorptive chemical measured at
   three water fluxes were more similar when the pore water velocity
   (q/theta) was computed using mobile water content (theta(m)) than total
   water content (theta). The BTCs for Br and NO3 were almost identical in
   shape at any given water flux. There was evidence of some attentuation
   of NO3, and its extent was larger at lower fluxes.
   The BTCs for the adsorption process, observed at different depths under
   three different flux conditions could be scaled approximately using only
   two similarities, i.e. pore volume for `mobile' water phase and Brenner
   number, VX/D{*}, where V is the average pore-water velocity, Xis the
   depth and D{*} is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient. Establishment
   of the similarity requires the condition that the retardation factor (R)
   be represented approximately as a function only of concentration. This
   suggests that in the assumed equilibrium isotherm, S = G(theta)F(C). The
   assumption that G(theta) is a linear function of theta is satisfactory
   for practical purposes. Here, S is the specific sorbed chemical (weight
   per unit dry soil weight), theta the volumetric water content and C the
   concentration.
   A comparison between the modified BTCs of phosphate and simazine for
   adsorption and desorption processes leads to the conclusion that both
   processes are more or less reversible. Based on the similarity, this
   requires a severe condition that R must be constant, i.e. dF/dC is
   constant. A similar analysis could not be applied to linuron data, as
   they exhibited a two-step concentration increment in the BTCs, and it is
   suggested that this may be caused by the presence of organic matter in
   the sand.}},

Abstract = {{It is generally recognized that the southern Arabian Peninsula has had
   two wet periods in the late Quaternary. To quantify `wet' a 28 000 year
   old capillary surface associated with a paleowater-table was mapped and
   used as a surrogate for the water table in a ground-water model.
   Analysis of this model suggests 1.4 mm year(-1) of recharge is necessary
   to support the water table at the mapped elevations during the wet
   period. Climatic relations between rainfall and recharge in arid areas
   infer that annual rainfall during this wet period was approximately 200
   +/- 50 mm year(-1) or approximately five times the present rate.}},

Abstract = {{Fog and rain were collected for stable isotopic analysis for nearly 4
   years at three locations on the Point Reyes Peninsula in California. In
   addition, in 1990, soil water and tree water were collected at the end
   of the rainy season, and again at the end of the foggy season to
   determine the importance of fog-drip water to arboreal vegetation. The
   stable isotopic compositions of the collected fog water range from -15.6
   to -9 parts per thousand in delta D and -2.9 to -2.0 parts per thousand
   in delta(18)O, and are consistently more enriched than the compositions
   of the rain, which range from -43 to -30 parts per thousand in delta D
   and from -7.6 to -5.8 parts per thousand in delta(18)O. Ground water
   collected from the Peninsula plots between the fog and rain was about 5
   parts per thousand more enriched in D than the rain and 15 parts per
   thousand more depleted than the fog. The stable isotopic composition of
   this ground water may reflect the addition of fog-drip water.
   The isotopic composition of the tree core water indicates varying
   degrees of fog water use by the arboreal vegetation. At the most coastal
   location, the vegetation appears to use fog-drip water year-round. At
   another location, the use is seasonal, occurring at least during the end
   of the summer foggy season. At the third location the vegetation appears
   to use solely ground water, which may or may not contain fog water.}},

Abstract = {{An instantaneous point injection of an artificial tracer makes it
   possible to identify the studied system directly. Whether or not
   convolutions can be carried out depends on the linearity and
   stationarity of the tracer-test system. Convolutions from the relations
   between the impulse responses and the hydrodynamic conditions in
   time-dependent systems are only allowed under special conditions. The
   framework in which such convolutions are possible is established and a
   convolution integral proposed which makes it possible to obtain the
   result of any input in time at one of the outlets of a vectorial system
   when an artificial tracer test has been carried out between the
   injection point and this outlet. A few theoretical examples of
   convolution results with variable flow rates are presented; these
   results were obtained with a computer code based on the proposed

Abstract = {{Artificial tracer tests conducted under different hydrodynamic
   conditions on the karst system of Ouysse (Causse de Gramat, France) and
   chemical measurements have permitted the use of the time-dependent
   tracer test analysis. For artificial tracer experiments in different
   hydrologic periods (water rise and high flow), the relationships between
   the responses to an instantaneous injection are improved in a system
   defined by two inputs (losses of Themines and Theminettes). They show
   that the space occupied by the mass of tracer during its transfer can be
   considered as independent of the discharge according to the range of
   flow rate in which the tracer experiments have been conducted.
   Therefore, convolutions on chlorides, nitrates and suspended sediments
   are simulated under the hypothesis of a constant-volume and
   time-dependent system. The computed results are compared with the
   experimental data at the output (cave of Besaces).}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic representation of aquifer parameters is adopted to
   incorporate their macroscopic variability (e.g. the horizontal
   variability at the scale of the order 1-10 m) into modeling the
   megascopic flow of ground water (i.e. the scale of the order of 1 km).
   The mathematical expression of the dynamics of megascopic ground water
   flow led to two deterministic coupled partial differential equations
   that must be solved simultaneously for the hydraulic head. The hydraulic
   head and the transmissivity are assumed to come from a joint Gaussian
   distribution, and the moment generating function is used to solve the
   closure problem. The assumption of a Gaussian distribution is more
   realistic for field applications than the commonly used perturbation
   techniques which neglect high-order moments of transmissivity and
   hydraulic head. The utility of the megascopic formulation of the ground
   water flow equation is demonstrated for the case of an aquifer in
   hydraulic connection with a stream. The small-scale macroscopic
   variability of aquifer transmissivity influences the megascopic behavior
   of the flow in the aquifer in both space and time. We propose to use the
   discrete kernels approach to reduce the amount of computations in
   stochastic ground water models.}},

Abstract = {{The relative importance of different recharge mechanisms has been
   investigated for a karstic area in a subhumid to semi-arid region of
   South Australia. The chemical and isotopic signature (delta(2)H and
   delta(18)O) of regional groundwater, sampled from shallow bores in the
   study area, as well as water from sinkholes, swamps, drainage bores and
   water extracted from soil in the unsaturated zone has been measured.
   Point estimates of recharge, based on data from the unsaturated zone,
   have been combined with temporal and spatial trends in the isotopic and
   chemical signature of the groundwater to provide a regional estimate for
   recharge for different land elements.
   For approximately half of the study area, which has predominantly clay
   soils, recharge is low (< 10 mm year(-1)) and the groundwaters within
   the study area are derived from lateral flow from the east. For the
   remaining area, recharge has significantly increased since agricultural
   development, and has affected the groundwater system. Groundwater within
   the vicinity of irrigation areas has shown marked increases in salinity
   over the past 30 years owing to the impact of irrigation drainage
   waters. Other areas not under irrigation, but cleared of native
   vegetation and replaced by shallow rooting pastures, also show increased
   salinity in parts where there are sandy soils. In these areas, saline
   soil water from the unsaturated zone has been displaced by the increased
   recharge since clearing. The effect of clearing on areas of clay surface
   soils has not increased recharge to the same extent and groundwater
   salinity levels are largely unchanged. Areas where salinity levels are
   rising correlate well with increased C-14 activity and depleted
   delta(13)C concentrations of the groundwater suggesting that these
   isotopes may be an early indicator of areas of enhanced recharge.}},
