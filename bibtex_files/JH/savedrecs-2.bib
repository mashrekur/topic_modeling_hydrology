Abstract = {{The processes and mechanisms that control pesticide transport from
   drained heavy clay catchments are being studied at Wytham Farm (Oxford
   University) in southern England. In the first field season field-drain
   water contained high concentrations of pesticide. Soil studies
   demonstrated that the main mechanism for pesticide translocation was by
   preferential flow processes, both over the soil surface and through the
   soil profile via a macropore system that effectively by-passed the soil
   matrix. This macropore system included worm holes, shrinkage cracks and
   cracks resulting from ploughing. Rainfall events in early winter rapidly
   created a layer of saturation in the A horizon perched above a B horizon
   of very low hydraulic conductivity. Drain flow was initiated when the
   saturated layer in the A horizon extended into the upper 0.06m of the
   soil profile; thereafter water moved down slope via horizontal
   macropores possibly through a band of incorporated straw residues. These
   horizontal pathways for water movement connected with the fracture
   system of the mole drains, thus feeding the drains. Overland flow
   occurred infrequently during the season.}},

Abstract = {{In a study of isoproturon applied to winter wheat in a heavy clay soil,
   high concentrations of herbicide were detected in overland flow (surface
   runoff) water, mole drain water and field drain water. The amount of
   isoproturon detected in the field drain, over two major rainfall events
   in 1993, was estimated to be 2.7\% of that potentially available at the
   soil surface. The peak drain water concentration of isoproturon in the
   first significant drain flow event was in excess of 500 ppb. For these
   two rainfall events, 1\% of the compound originally applied was lost to
   the drainage system. Comparison of isoproturon with chloride and
   sulphate concentrations suggests different origins for the drain water,
   with the majority of isoproturon being carried down to the drainage
   system by preferential flow from the soil surface. A residue of 5-10\%
   of the herbicide persisted in the top soil and did not appear to be
   degraded in the period of May to June.}},

Abstract = {{A model for simulating cadmium transport in Soil is presented. The
   calculation scheme is based on a three-dimensional advection-dispersion
   model. The adsorption process is defined by a lumped parameter
   mathematical model in which the, amount of ions that remains in solution
   is correlated with the amount that originally exists in the input
   solution. Desorption is defined in the same way by correlating the
   amount of ions desorbed with the amount of ions held by the soil solid
   surface. Both relationships incorporate the effect of soil solution pH,
   which is defined by a power equation that predicts the pH value at any
   time and at any depth, from the pH of the input solution and elapsed
   time. Soil column experiments were conducted to validate the performance
   of the model. Also, batch tests were employed to determine the essential
   adsorption-desorption parameters that are required to operate the model.
   In light of the results, it was concluded that the model satisfactorily
   forecasts cadmium concentration and the pH of soil solution under varied
   acidic conditions. However, values of model parameters are strictly
   empirical and need to be determined for each soil type.}},

Abstract = {{In order to better understand factors controlling the migration of
   inorganic colloids through heterogeneous porous media, the transport of
   colloidal silica through columns containing a single preferred flow path
   was investigated. The preferred flow path, which consisted of a tubule
   of coarse-grained sand, was embedded in a matrix of fine-grained sand.
   The relative importance of advection, dispersion, deposition (removal of
   particles from suspension), entrainment (resuspension of deposited
   particles), and mass exchange between the two pore water regions was
   evaluated by comparing experimental data to calculations of a
   two-dimensional advection-dispersion model. Results of this comparison
   indicate that silica movement could be understood in terms of
   advective-dispersive transport in the preferred flow path and
   surrounding matrix with small interaction between the adjacent regions.
   Deposition of silica was found to follow a first-order kinetic process
   and was at least partially reversible.}},

Abstract = {{The Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) method was used to calibrate the
   wind function constants (W-f = a(w) + b(w)u(2)) in the aerodynamic term
   of the Penman equation for computation of the hourly and 24 h
   alfalfa-reference evapotranspiration (E(tr)) at an irrigated semi-arid
   valley in northern Utah during the 1991-1992 growing season. Statistical
   analysis of the 28 non-rainy days (when the conditions of
   alfalfa-reference evapotranspiration were met) showed that the hourly
   constants in the wind function were a(w) = 2.677 and b(w) = 0.127 (with
   u(2) expressed in km h(-1)). The hourly relationship between the
   alfalfa-reference evapotranspiration estimated by the BREB method
   (E(tr(BREB))) and that computed by the Penman method (E(tr(Penman))) is
   E(tr(Penman)) = 0.976B(tr(BREB)), with the correlation coefficient (R)
   equal to 0.974. The daily (24 h) constants were a(w) = 1.00 and b(w) =
   0.014 (with u(2) expressed in km day(-1)). The 24 h relationship is
   E(tr(Penman)) = 1.009E(tr(BREB)), With R = 0.988. The wind function
   constants found here can be applied for computation of hourly and 24 h
   alfalfa-reference evapotranspiration and irrigation scheduling in this
   semi-arid valley.}},

Abstract = {{Remediation of hydrocarbon-contaminated sites can be costly and the
   design process becomes complex in the presence of parameter uncertainty.
   Classical decision theory related to remediation design requires the
   parameter uncertainties to be stipulated in terms of statistical
   estimates based on site observations. In the absence of detailed data on
   parameter uncertainty, classical decision theory provides little
   contribution in designing a risk-based optimal design strategy. Bayesian
   decision theory, however, allows the use of subjective judgments of the
   designer together with parameter uncertainty in the decision-making
   process. In the present work, Bayesian theory is used in developing the
   theoretical framework for risk-based design analysis for soil gas
   venting operations. Two utility functions, exponential and quadratic,
   were used in the analysis, identifying the cost, and risk associated
   with under- or over-achieving the site stipulated remediation targets.
   Preposterior analysis provided the information on estimated optimal
   venting time, optimal effective how rate and sample size for both
   utility functions, and the applicability of each function. Hypothetical
   field-scale simulations using normal and weathered gasoline were
   performed to demonstrate the applicability of Bayesian decision theory
   based analysis for practical scale problems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews application of borehole flowmeters in granular and
   fractured rocks. Basic data obtained in the field are the ambient flow
   log and the pumping-induced flow log. These basic logs may then be used
   to calculate other quantities of interest. The paper describes the
   applications of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) electromagnetic
   (EM) flowmeter in a granular medium. In an attempt to ascertain the
   effect of formation disturbance on flowmeter readings, test wells were
   subjected to repeated periods of development using air lifting. Between
   the development periods, flowmeter tests were run. The results indicated
   that flowmeter data are not highly sensitive to formation disturbance in
   the near vicinity of a test well. Evidence of changes in the natural
   (ambient) flow in the test well was attributed to high, variable rates
   of pumping by nearby chemical plants. In fractured media, flowmeters may
   be used to detect flow to or from individual fractures or fracture
   zones. In these applications, additional information in the form of
   caliper, televiewer and resistivity logs are useful. Further studies of
   the type described herein are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Parameter estimation is made for an anisotropic leaky aquifer system in
   which the direction of principal axes is unknown. There is a declining
   water table in the aquitard. The seven governing parameters are the
   direction of principal axes, the degree of anisotropy, the equivalent
   transmissivity and storage coefficient of the aquifer, and the leakage
   coefficient, specific storage and specific yield of the unconfined
   aquitard. A modified parameter perturbation technique which is
   computationally efficient is used for the determination of sensitivity
   coefficients. The parameter estimation procedure is applied to three
   test problems including one field problem. Situations where the total
   number of wells is only three are handled with two pump tests by
   locating the pump in a different well in each test.}},

Abstract = {{Some sources and controls on nonstrom streamflow from a 19.8 ha
   agricultural hill land catchment located in east-central Pennsylvania
   were hypothesized and identified based on O-18, Si, NO3, Cl and SO4
   concentration patterns.  Streamflow, springflow, soil water, seepage and
   shallow groundwater were sampled routinely from 16 October to 20
   November 1989, which included three storms (17-20 October, 9 November
   and 14 November).  The first storm caused this catchment to shift from a
   low to high flow regime typical of the late autumn period.  The chemical
   patterns in streamflow followed a three-part sequence - stormflow, early
   post-storm drain-down period, and subsequent post-storm base flow
   period.  The stormflow period was characterized by dilution of NO3, Cl,
   SO4, Si and O-18, whereas the highest NO3, Cl and SO4 concentrations and
   flow rates occurred during the early post-storm period, suggesting that
   additional subsurface sources were temporarily activated by the storms. 
   The chemical patterns and concentrations during base flow periods tended
   to be similar irrespective of preceding rainfall, which suggests that
   subsurface storage is a key control on streamflow chemistry.  Nonstorm
   streamflow included discharge from springs, and near-stream seepage, and
   groundwater sampling sites located upstream.  The spring and stream
   chemistry were most similar, but differed from the shallow groundwater
   and seepage, which were nearly twice as concentrated in NO3.  Thus,
   these sampling sites did not represent all nonstorm streamflow sources. 
   The chemical indices most useful for characterizing the sources and
   behavior of nonstorm streamflow were NO3 (agricultural land), SO4, Cl
   and NO3 (storm-activated subsurface source areas).  SO4 (spring
   contributions), Cl and O-18 (dilution or mixing), Si (geochemically
   controlled and stable - latter nonstorm period; dilution controlled -
   storm period; kinetically controlled - early post-storm).  The ratios of
   these chemical parameters were examined as indices; Si/Cl and SO4/NO3
   were the most interesting and provided additional tools and insights for
   characterizing hydrologic source areas.}},

Abstract = {{To increase understanding of hydrologic flow paths, two- and
   three-component tracer models were used to determine stormflow
   components on a 19.8 ha agricultural catchment in central Pennsylvania. 
   Three events were studied during the 1989 autumn recharge period with
   the first and largest storm having a 5-10 year return period, 80 mm
   rainfall.  Continuous precipitation and streamflow records were
   augmented by observations and sampling of spring and seepage discharge
   along with shallow wells and soil water.  During the largest storm
   event, a two-tracer, three-component model separation using O-18 and Si
   indicated that 42\% of total flow was derived from shallow subsurface
   stormflow, 11\% from surface event water, and 47\% from deep subsurface
   groundwater flow.  Similar analysis using Si and NO3 for a 34 mm
   rainfall event showed 17\% of total flow to be from shallow subsurface
   flow, 10\% from surface event water and 73\% from deep subsurface
   groundwater flow.  Based upon analysis of tracer concentration
   variations in soil water, shallow well water and springflow during these
   events, shallow subsurface stormflow was found to be a transient mixture
   of infiltrated event water (28\% average maximum contribution) and
   stored pre-event water (72\% average minimum contribution).  Thus, two
   major pathways for transferring event water to streamflow existed in
   these two events:  (1) overland flow and channel precipitation (10-11\%
   of total flow); (2) shallow subsurface stormflow (5-12\% of total flow).
   In the third event analyzed, 9 mm of rainfall was insufficient to
   generate shallow subsurface stormflow, and two-component models using
   O-18, Si and NO3 indicated 10\%, 4\% and 3\% event water contributions,
   respectively.  Major early autumn storms, occurring before subsurface
   water becomes well mixed in this region, offer an opportunity to
   differentiate shallow and deep subsurface pathways for streamflow
   generation using two-tracer, three-component models.}},

Abstract = {{Preservation of native valley-floor phreatophytes while pumping
   groundwater for export from Owens Valley, California, requires reliable
   predictions of plant water use.  These predictions are compared with
   stored soil water within well field regions and serve as a basis for
   managing groundwater resources.  Soil water measurement errors, variable
   recharge, unpredictable climatic conditions affecting plant water use,
   and modeling errors make soil water predictions uncertain and
   error-prone.  We developed and tested a scheme based on soil water
   balance coupled with implementation of Kalman filtering (KF) for (1)
   providing physically based soil water storage predictions with
   prediction errors projected from the statistics of the various inputs,
   and (2) reducing the overall uncertainty in both estimates and
   predictions.  The proposed KF-based scheme was tested using experimental
   data collected at a location on the Owens Valley floor where the water
   table was artificially lowered by groundwater pumping and later allowed
   to recover.  Vegetation composition and per cent cover, climatic data,
   and soil water information were collected and used for developing a soil
   water balance.  Predictions and updates of soil water storage under
   different types of vegetation were obtained for a period of 5 years. 
   The main results show that:  (1) the proposed predictive model provides
   reliable and resilient soil water estimates under a wide range of
   external conditions; (2) the predicted soil water storage and the error
   bounds provided by the model offer a realistic and rational basis for
   decisions such as when to curtail well field operation to ensure plant
   survival.  The predictive model offers a practical means for
   accommodating simple aspects of spatial variability by considering the
   additional source of uncertainty as part of modeling or measurement
   uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Water transport in structured soils is influenced strongly by
   macropores.  This study developed a water transport model to simulate
   bypass flow processes on the field scale.  The LEACHW-model was extended
   with subroutines describing bypass flow, tortuous water transport
   through macropores and absorption of water along macropore walls.  The
   model was tested on measurements from an experimental site in the
   Netherlands.  A Monte-Carlo analysis in combination with a
   Rotated-Random-Scan procedure took variability of model parameters into
   account and, subsequently, calibrated the model.  A sensitivity analysis

Abstract = {{A storage-discharge equation:  S = kQ(m) is often used in runoff-routing
   models.  The prediction by the models is highly sensitive to the value
   of exponent m used.  A discharge-depth equation:  q = Ky(alpha)S(e)1/2
   can be used to simulate overland and channel flows and the two equations
   considered here are shown to be similar and their parameters
   interrelated.  Although the species of vegetative covers encountered in
   field data considered in the present study are probably not typical of
   those generally encountered on the catchments, their characteristics
   which influence overland and channel flows particularly on small
   catchments are of relevance here.  The values of alpha obtained from
   shallow overland flow and channel flow studies suggest that the exponent
   m in the storage-discharge equation should be varied between 0.33 and
   1.00 depending upon the regime of flow and degree of turbulence in the
   flow.  While the study provides a further understanding of the variation
   of exponent m, more research is needed particularly in quantifying the
   degree of turbulence in the flow and developing a practical method of
   varying m in the runoff-routing model to account for flow conditions
   present over the catchment.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional surface energy-balance lake model, coupled to a
   thermodynamic model of lake ice, is used to simulate variations in the
   temperature of and evaporation from three Estonian lakes:  Karujarv,
   Viljandi and Kirjaku.  The model is driven by daily climate data,
   derived by cubic-spline interpolation from monthly mean data, and was
   run for periods of 8 years (Kirjaku) up to 30 years (Viljandi). 
   Simulated surface water temperature is in good agreement with
   observations:  mean differences between simulated and observed
   temperatures are from -0.8-degrees-C to + 0.1-degrees-C.  The simulated
   duration of snow and ice cover is comparable with observed.  However,
   the model generally underpredicts ice thickness and overpredicts snow
   depth.  Sensitivity analyses suggest that the model results are robust
   across a wide range (0.1-2.0 m-1) of lake extinction coefficient: 
   surface temperature differs by less than 0.5-degrees-C between extreme
   values of the extinction coefficient.  The model results are more
   sensitive to snow and ice albedos.  However, changing the snow (0.2-0.9)
   and ice (0.15-0.55) albedos within realistic ranges does not improve the
   simulations of snow depth and ice thickness.  The underestimation of ice
   thickness is correlated with the overestimation of snow cover, since a
   thick snow layer insulates the ice and limits ice formation.  The
   overestimation of snow cover results from the assumption that all the
   simulated winter precipitation occurs as snow, a direct consequence of
   using daily climate data derived by interpolation from mean monthly
   data.}},

Abstract = {{The travel time transport approach for radioactive elements undergoing
   sorption and decay is employed in assessing the potential health risk at
   possible locations of human receptors.  The principal entity in approach
   presented is a travel time probability density function conditioned on
   the set of parameters used to describe different transport processes,
   like advection, dispersion, sorption, and decay.  The importance of
   accounting for parameter uncertainty and possible correlation between
   them is described and demonstrated in the study of risk analysis at the
   Nevada Test Site (NTS), which is located in the southwestern part of the
   state of Nevada.  Because of the lack of sorption, the migration of
   tritium is found to provide the largest health risk to the accessible
   environment.  Inclusion of the sorption process indicates that the
   parameter uncertainty and especially negative correlation between the
   mean velocity and the sorption strength are important in evaluating the
   arrival time of radionuclides at the prespecified accessible
   environment.  The results from the risk-based screening analysis suggest
   that tritium, which does not sorb and has a short effective half-life
   (both physical and biological), is responsible for about 90\% of the
   total risk.}},

Abstract = {{This study was undertaken to determine the effects of sewage-sludge
   disposal at the Lowry sewage-sludge-disposal area, near Denver,
   Colorado, on ground- and surface-water quality, to determine the fate of
   nitrates from sludge leachate, and to determine the source areas of
   leachate and the potential for additional leaching from the disposal
   area.
   Sewage-sludge disposal began in 1969.  Two methods were used to apply
   the sludge:  burial and plowing.  Also, the sludge was applied both in
   liquid and cake forms.  Data in this report represent the chemical
   composition of soil and streambed sediment from seven soil- and four
   streambed-sampling sites in 1986, chemical and bacterial composition of
   ground water from 28 wells from 1981 to 1987, and surface-water runoff
   from seven water-sampling sites from 1984 to 1987.  Ground water samples
   were obtained from alluvial and bedrock aquifers.  Samples of soil,
   streambed sediment, ground water and surface water were obtained for
   onsite measurement and chemical analysis.  Measurements included
   determination of nitrogen compounds and major cations and anions,
   fecal-coliform and -streptococcus bacteria, specific conductance, and
   pH.
   Thirteen wells in the alluvial aquifer in Region 3 of the study area
   contain water that was probably affected by sewage-sludge leachate.  The
   plots of concentration of nitrate with time show seasonal trends and
   trends caused by precipitation.  In addition to yearly fluctuation,
   there were noticeable increases in ground-water concentrations of
   nitrate that coincided with increased precipitation.  After 3 years of
   annual ground-water-quality monitoring and 4 years of a quarterly
   sampling program, it has been determined that leachate from the
   sewage-sludge-disposal area caused increased nitrite plus nitrate (as
   nitrogen) concentration in the alluvial ground water at the site.  Soil
   analyses from the disposal area indicate that organic nitrogen was the
   dominant form of nitrogen in the soil.
   As a result of investigations at the research site, it has been
   determined that a potentially large source of contamination exists in
   the soils of the study area owing to increased concentrations of
   nitrogen, sodium, calcium, magnesium, sulfate, bicarbonate, and chloride
   because of sewage disposal.  Continued monitoring of surface and ground
   water for nitrogen and the other ions previously mentioned is required
   to assess long-term effects of municipal sludge disposal on water
   quality.}},

   Miscible-displacement experiments performed with a well-characterized

Abstract = {{(1) During the dry summer of 1989 stomatal conductance (g(s)),
   boundary-layer conductance (g(a)), leaf water and osmotic potentials
   (psi(1), psi(pi)) and leaf area index (L{*}) measurements were made in
   mature ash and beech stands growing on shallow soil over chalk near
   Winchester, Hampshire, UK. In addition measurements of g(s) and L{*}
   were made in the understorey layer in the ash stand, comprised mainly of
   dog's mercury, hazel and bramble. Automatic weather stations located (i)
   above the beech stand and (ii) at the understorey level (within the ash
   stand) provided hourly averages of weather variables. Changes in soil
   moisture deficit in both stands were determined from regular
   measurements made with a neutron probe.
   (2) Maximum values of g(s) (up to 0.3 mol m(-2) s(-1)) were found at the
   top of the ash and beech canopies at the start of the day, while at the
   canopy base g(s) was about half of these values. At all canopy levels
   the value of g(s) was more closely associated with specific humidity
   deficit (at the time of measurement) than with any other weather
   variable, and there was no relationship between g(s) and soil mositure
   deficit or leaf water status, described by psi(1) and psi(pi) on the day
   of measurement.
   (3) Values of g(s) of the understorey plants were only half those of the
   tree species and changed less during the day. However, seasonal changes
   in g(s) of dog's mercury did seem to be associated with increased soil
   moisture deficit.
   (4) Estimates of L{*} in the ash and beech stands were made from leaf
   litter collections and partitioned into canopy layers using ratios
   determined by destructive sampling. L{*} of the beech stand was 5.3 and
   for the ash stand 2.7. L{*} of the understorey varied seasonally and
   rose to a peak of 3 in June falling gradually for the remainder of the
   summer period.
   (5) Hourly values of g(s) and g(a) in each stand for each canopy layer
   were scaled up to the canopy by using L{*} of the individual canopy
   layers (including the understorey level in the ash stand) and were
   combined with values of net radiation, temperature and specific humidity
   deficit in a multi-layer formulation of the Penman-Monteith equation
   (Monteith, 1965) to estimate stand transpiration. Averaged over 1990 and
   1991, the annual transpiration loss from the ash stand was 407 mm and
   from the beech stand 393 mm. The average understorey contribution to the
   total loss from the ash stand was 45\% over a year, being around 25 to
   30\% when the trees were in leaf.}},

Abstract = {{The construction of a number of low crested barrage embankments across
   estuaries in the UK is under consideration. The structures will modify
   the hydrological regime to the advantage of certain infrastructural
   developments but the regime modifications will have repercussions for
   both surface water and groundwater that will impact upon the
   environment. Considering groundwater only, the main impact could be the
   effect of dampness in properties through groundwater head rise in urban
   areas. Because of the hydrogeological complexity of many of the urban
   related estuary areas coupled with the small anticipated rise in heads
   it is concluded that deterministic numerical modelling predictions of
   the head change cannot be realistically made and that schemes should
   proceed by staged impoundment, and compatible remediation where

Abstract = {{A transient model was used to represent single borehole injection tests

   removed and replaced in the system by an equivalent parameter. These
   efforts can save computer time or enlarge the modelled rock volume.
   Moreover, this approach may be helpful in addressing the troublesome
   up-scaling problem in discontinuous media.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of preferential flow on Cl-36 transport in undisturbed sand
   and clay soil monolith lysimeters were quantified using a dual-porosity
   model (MACRO). A double tracer test with H-3 and Cl-36 was performed
   simultaneously to check the possible occurrence of sidewall flow in the
   lysimeters. In the dual-porosity model MACRO, simulations can be
   performed in both one and two flow domains. Run in one flow domain, the
   model reduces to numerical solutions of Richards' equation and the
   convection-dispersion equation. In the sandy soil, the occurrence of
   preferential flow was tested by simulating in one domain, assuming that
   a certain pore fraction takes no part in water flow and solute
   transport. For the clay soil, the one domain case was compared with two
   domain simulations accounting for macropore flow.
   The double-tracer tests showed that sidewall flow did not occur in
   either soil type. Simulations of water flow showed good agreement with
   observed seepage until late autumn, but were less good during winter
   because the model does not account for soil freezing and
   snowpack/snowmelt. Simulated water flows were similar in one and two
   domain simulations, presumably because water contents in the lysimeters
   were maintained close to held capacity during the experiment.
   The simulations indicated that preferential how occurred in the sandy
   soil, with the observed Cl-36 breakthrough curves, assuming an unwetted
   volumetric pore fraction of 20\%, reproduced reasonably well. The rate
   of Cl-36 leaching was consequently increased by c. 25\% compared with
   the simulation assuming no preferential flow. Macropore flow was clearly
   demonstrated in the clay soil. The two domain simulation matched the
   breakthough curve and accumulated Cl-36 leaching accurately when the
   soil water pressure head defining the boundary between pore domains was
   set to -50 cm. This implies that preferential Cl-36 transport was taking
   place in a wide range of pore sizes, including smaller mesopores. The
   one domain simulation failed to predict the pattern of breakthrough of
   Cl-36 in the clay soil, in that it seriously underestimated leaching at
   early times and overestimated leaching towards the end of the
   experiment. Accounting for preferential flow with the dual porosity
   model resulted in significantly improved estimates of solute transport,
   compared to the classical convective-dispersive treatment, for both
   nonstructured sands and structured clay soils.}},

Abstract = {{Throughfall and catchment mass balance approaches were used to estimate
   dry deposition inputs of SO4 and Cl to the Bear Brook in Maine for the
   period November 1988-November 1992. For throughfall, dry deposition of
   SO4 and Cl averaged 320 and 261 eq ha(-1) year(-1), respectively, or 0.9
   and 1.5 times the input in precipitation, respectively. The equivalent
   values for the catchment gave dry deposition of SO4 and Cl as 616 and
   380 eq ha(-1) year(-1), respectively, or 1.7 and 2.2 times the input in
   precipitation, respectively. The lower estimates obtained by the canopy
   mass balance method are primarily attributed to an underestimation of
   the importance of conifers in intercepting dry and occult deposition,
   particularly in mixed hardwood-softwood canopies such as the Bear Brook,
   Although net throughfall is commonly used to estimate dry and occult
   deposition in forested catchments, dry deposition may be underestimated,
   particularly in uneven-aged, mixed hardwood-softwood forests
   characterized by occasional superdominant conifers. The uneven canopy
   architecture of such forests increases its aerodynamic roughness and
   thus its efficacy in capturing dry deposition. Mixed-species forests,
   resulting from both natural and anthropogenic disturbance, are a common
   component of the landscape throughout much of New England.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of a small remnant wetland on streamwater chemistry at the
   outflow of an afforested catchment has been investigated. The wetland
   reduced the volume weighted mean concentrations of a number of solutes.
   Stream solute loadings were calculated from chemical and flow data from
   two flumes situated above and below the wetland at the catchment outlet.
   The flow contribution from the wetland itself was estimated on an areal
   basis and combined with sampled chemistry to estimate solute fluxes.
   Streamwater dissolved nitrogen loading, equivalent to an input of 55 kg
   N ha(-1) year(-1), was reduced by 38\% after flowing through the
   wetland. Reductions in streamwater loadings were also observed for
   phosphate (94\%), total dissolved-P (42\%), total monomeric aluminium
   (39\%), total filtrable aluminium (21\%), iron (54\%), DOC (34\%) and
   silica (21\%). All other retention rates were within the original
   streamwater loading estimate errors. Retention of nitrogen was lower
   than expected, perhaps due to exhaustion of the wetland's immobilisation
   capacity by the large nitrogen loading in the streamwater entering the
   wetland from the surrounding land in combination with atmospheric
   loadings. Retention of nitrogen and other solutes was also reduced due
   to a prolonged period of low rainfall during the summer of 1989 which
   resulted in high concentration events of various elements from the
   wetland relative to concentrations at the wetland inflow.}},

Abstract = {{A conceptual hydrologic rainfall-runoff model that is an adaptation of
   the operational US National Weather Service hydrologic model is used to
   simulate the hydrologic processes in large basins of the US upper
   Mississippi region. In particular, the conceptual rainfall-runoff model
   is used to produce daily streamflow from daily rainfall, temperature and
   potential evapotranspiration input over three neighboring headwater
   basins that span 2 degrees longitude by 2 degrees latitude. When used
   for simulation of historical flows, the model provides a means of
   inference of the 40 year time series of unrecorded mesoscale soil water
   and actual evapotranspiration for climate studies. In this paper we
   discuss issues associated with parameter estimation, the reliability and
   stability of parameter estimates, and the interpretation of soil water
   estimates. It is concluded that the conceptual hydrologic model may be
   used to estimate the variability of aggregate soil water over large
   areas of the Midwestern US provided that: (a) all significant basin
   inflows and outflows are accounted for; (b) model verification yields
   good agreement between observed and simulated flows on a daily basis.
   Parameter sensitivity studies showed that estimating the soil's capacity
   to hold water is most important for flood event prediction and flow
   simulation, and, for such parameters, underestimation is more critical
   than overestimation. Also, uncertainty associated with the
   parametrization of evapotranspiration may introduce local errors in the
   time series of soil water estimates produced by the model. In a
   companion paper we present a spatio-temporal analysis of the estimated
   time series of soil water.}},

Abstract = {{A study of the model-estimated soil water, aggregated over three large
   drainage basins of the Midwestern USA, is reported. The basin areas are
   in the range from 2000 km(2) to 3500 km(2), and allow the study of
   mesoscale (1000-10 000 km(2)) soil water features. In each case, a
   conceptual hydrologic model was used to produce upper and lower soil
   water estimates that are consistent with the atmospheric forcing of
   daily precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and air temperature,
   and with the observed daily streamflow divergence over a 40 year period.
   It is shown that the water contents of the upper and lower soil reach
   peaks in different months, with the soil column being most saturated in
   June, when the area is prone to serious flooding. Temporal and spatial
   features of the variability of model-estimated soil water content are
   identified. The autocorrelation function of monthly averaged soil water
   shows that the upper soil water remains persistent for about a season,
   whereas the persistence of the lower soil water extends to several
   seasons. The soil water estimates of the three study basins exhibit
   strong similarities in annual cycles and interannual variability. It is
   shown that the frequency of significant positive (wet) soil water
   anomalies that extend over a 2 degrees x 2 degrees region is lower than
   that of significant negative (dry) ones of the same extent in this
   region of the USA.}},

Abstract = {{The transpiration of forest growth during the growing season when
   sufficient soil moisture is available is estimated on the basis of the
   requirement of water for cooling trees. Tree growth is regarded as a
   cooler with water as a coolant (evaporative latent heat). Trees are
   simultaneously warmed up by incident solar radiation and cooled down by
   the ambient air and by the evaporation of water from the leaf. These
   parallel, mutually competing processes are described in their simplest
   form and provide the algorithm for the calculation of the cooling-water
   requirement. The calculation uses hourly values of air temperature and
   of global-radiation totals. Properties of the forest growth are
   expressed in terms of two phenomenological constants - effective
   absorptivity and effective thickness of leaves. Both are obtained by
   calibration. The applicability of the proposed calculation was subjected
   to experimental verification during the course of the growing seasons
   for 1985-1989 in the mountain watershed LIZ, situated in the National
   Park Sumava in the southern part of the Czech Republic. The error in
   determining evapotranspiration/transpiration is about 5\% of the

Abstract = {{Earlier investigations at South Creek in northeastern Queensland
   established the importance of overland flow as a hydrologic pathway in
   this tropical rainforest environment.  Since this pathway is `fast',
   transmitting presumably `new' water, its importance should be reflected
   in the stormflow chemistry of South Creek:  the greater the volumetric
   contribution to the stormflow hydrograph, the more similarity between
   the chemical composition of streamwater and of overland flow is to be
   expected.  Water samples were taken during two storm events in an
   ephemeral gully (gully A), an intermittent gully (gully B) and at the
   South Creek catchment outlet; additional spot checks were made in
   several poorly defined rills.  The chemical composition of `old' water
   was determined from 45 baseflow samples collected throughout February. 
   The two events differed considerably in their magnitudes, intensities
   and antecedent moisture conditions.  In both events, the stormflow
   chemistry in South Creek was characterized by a sharp decrease in Ca,
   Mg, Na, Si, Cl, EC, ANC, alkalinity and total inorganic carbon.  pH
   remained nearly constant with discharge, whereas K increased sharply, as
   did sulfate in an ill-defined manner.
   In event 1, this South Creek stormflow pattern was closely matched by
   the pattern in gully A, implying a dominant contribution of `new' water.
   This match was confirmed by the spot samples from rills.  Gully B
   behaved like South Creek itself, but with a dampened `new' water signal,
   indicating less overland flow generation in its subcatchment.  In event
   2, which occurred five days later, the initial `new' water signal in
   gully A was rapidly overwhelmed by a different signal which is
   attributed to rapid drainage from a perched water table.
   This study shows that stormflow in this rainforest catchment consists
   predominantly of `new' water which reaches the stream channel via `fast'
   pathways.  Where the ephemeral gullies delivering overland flow are
   incised deeply enough to intersect a perched water table, a delayed,
   `old' water-like signal may be transmitted.}},

Abstract = {{An intensive multidisciplinary experiment has been conducted over
   several years at La Cote Saint-Andre, near Grenoble, France.  The major
   objective is to determine an optimal fertilizer application scheme for
   an irrigated agricultural system.  Such a scheme would not degrade the
   quality of the environment, and yet would maintain a profitable level of
   crop production.  This study is explicitly related to the cultivation of
   irrigated maize, a major crop in the area.  The various terms of the
   water balance (consumption, drainage, soil storage) and of the nitrogen
   cycle (mineralization, plant uptake, leaching) were obtained from
   intensive monitoring in the upper layer of the 0.8 m of soil which
   corresponds to the root zone of the crop.  This entailed the combined
   use of a neutron moisture meter, tensiometers and soil suction cups.  To
   determine the specific effects of fertilization and crop growth, there
   were different treatments.  These corresponded to a traditional
   fertilizer application of 260 kg N ha-1, no fertilization, and bare
   soil, carried out within an area of approximately 2 ha.  Several sites
   were instrumented on each treatment, one of them being specifically for
   the application and the monitoring of N-15-tagged fertilizer.
   The results have shown that, in terms of the water balance, irrigation
   water management is extremely efficient, as drainage losses under the
   maize culture are negligible during the crop cycle.  The situation is
   totally different, however, during the intercrop period (October-April),
   owing to rainfall.  Then the soil is left bare and evaporation is very
   small, and now the drainage corresponds to about 90\% of total inputs
   from precipitation.
   In terms of the nitrogen cycle, the results showed clearly that up to
   150 kg N ha-1 was produced by mineralization in the soil.  Nitrogen
   leaching beyond the root zone during the crop cycle is negligible,
   regardless of the rate of fertilizer application, as a result of the
   very small amount of drainage, despite irrigation.  A very important
   contrast was found, however, between the fertilized and unfertilized
   treatments at harvest.  There was a residue of 182 +/- 64 kg N ha-1 in
   the fertilized sites, but none for the others.  The whole quantity
   remaining in the root zone at harvest was then totally leached by winter
   rains.  To decrease the risk of groundwater pollution, a reduction of
   about 100 kg N ha-1 from the traditional application rate has been
   recommended.  Finally, the method of estimation of N balance has been
   successfully validated by a comparison between N uptake determined by
   direct analysis of the whole plant and the value estimated from the
   temporal variations of the N content in the soil.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying the role of soil water in stormflow generation is a
   difficult but important goal for addressing catchment scale
   environmental problems.  The purpose of this study was to combine
   natural tracer methods and hydrometric observations to estimate the
   contribution of pre-event (vadose) soil water to stormflow in a small
   forested headwater catchment in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia.  Two
   storm hydrographs were separated, based on mass balance of naturally
   occurring O-18 and chloride, into three physically based source
   components.  For a large storm event in June 1992, pre-event soil water
   contributed 36\% of total storm runoff and dominated peak flow (65\%),
   based on the hydrograph separation.  For a smaller storm event in
   November 1992, soil water contributed 25\% of the total runoff and 50\%
   during peak flow.  A Monte Carlo error analysis of the hydrograph
   separations supported the interpretation for the June storm that
   pre-event soil water dominated peak flow (alpha = 0.12), but showed
   considerable uncertainty-the estimated soil water contribution ranged
   from 48\% to 88\% at peak flow at a confidence level of 68\%-even under
   the relatively good conditions (i.e. relatively distinct source
   component chemical and isotopic compositions).  Analysis of the November
   storm indicated greater uncertainty and a more poorly identifiable soil
   water component.  The June storm was typical of `sharp' responses that
   occurred coincident with the development of a transient saturated zone
   above the soil-bedrock interface on hillslopes, whereas the November
   storm was representative of slower delayed responses in which the
   hydrograph peak occurred 8-10 h after the end of precipitation.  During
   the 6 month study, five other hydrographs displayed the `sharp' response
   and three other hydrographs showed the delayed response.  During all
   storms, water draining from the soil into zero-tension lysimeters
   maintained the isotopic content of pre-event soil water; this result was
   taken as evidence that transient saturated zones would consist of nearly
   all pre-event soil water.  Field observations after large storm events
   suggest a threshold type expansion of the source area onto the
   hillslopes which may supplement rates of downslope flow of displaced
   pre-event soil water.  This study provides evidence that mobilization of
   pre-event soil water may dominate peak stormflow in steep forested
   headwater catchments, and illustrates that quantitative error analyses
   are advisable for hydrograph separation studies.}},

Abstract = {{The constant-head permeameter method has been used to determine the
   field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (K(fs)) of unsaturated soils in
   the vadose zone for many years.  This method was developed based on
   steady-state flow under a constant hydraulic head.  The calculated K(fs)
   values based on the classic analytical solution are much lower than
   those based on a numerical solution, wheras K(fs) values based on the
   half-source solution provide a closer approximation of numerical
   results.  Both the classic and the half-source solutions produce errors
   in evaluations of K(fs) because the pressures evaluated by both
   solutions are correct only for the bottom of the borehole.  By forcing
   the estimated pressures at the water surface and at the bottom of the
   borehole to be consistent with the actual pressures, a new solution is
   developed.  Because K(fs) is proportional to the shape factor C, which
   depends on the ratio of H/a, where H is the water height and a is the
   radius of the borehole, a comparison of the shape factors calculated
   based on different solutions was conducted.  Results show that the
   proposed method is simpler and provides C values closer to actual
   numerical results than do the other solutions for the range H/a = 1-10,
   although the Philips method can provide a good estimation as well.  To
   show the relative accuracy of the proposed solution, the total water
   pressure on the surface of the borehole is also compared using different
   solutions.  Results show that the proposed solution agrees with the
   pressure distribution on the borehole surface better than do the other
   solutions for the range H/a = 1-10.  The unsaturated effect on the
   calculated K(fs) is significant, but the method developed by Reynolds et
   al.  (Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J., 139:172-180, 1985) and Reynolds and Elrick
   (Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J., 140:292-302, 1985a) may provide an unrealistic
   negative parameter when soil heterogeneity is strong.  To avoid tests
   conducted in strongly heterogeneous soils, equations to evaluate the
   maximum and minimum flow rate ratios are proposed.}},

   Events were separated into high-flow and low-flow.  High-flow events had
   characteristics attributable to pipe flow.  Correlation and stepwise
   regression were used to develop peak flow rate prediction equations for
   the combined 108 events and for the 81 low-flow events.  The portion of
   the recession curve identified as pipe flow was a watershed constant and
   time invariant.  The base flow was seasonal, increasing in the winter to
   approximately 0.071 m3 s-1 and decreasing in the summer to approximately
   0.014 m3 s-1.}},

Abstract = {{Aerial photographs (AP) and Landsat (TM) colour composites were used to
   map the geomorphology, geology and structures of the Salt River System
   of Western Australia.  Geomorphic features identified are sand plains,
   dissected etchplain, colluvium, lateritic duricrust and rock outcrops. 
   The hydrogeomorphic units include streams, lakes and playas,
   palaeochannels and palaeodeltas.  The structural features are linear and
   curvilinear lineaments, ring structures and dolerite dykes.  Suture
   lines control the course of the main river channel.  Permeable areas
   around the circular granitic plutons were found to be the main areas of
   recharge in the uplands.  Recharge was also found to occur in the highly
   permeable areas of the sandplains.  Discharge was shown to be primarily
   along the main drainage lines, on the edge of the circular sandplains,
   in depressions and in lakes.  The groundwater occurrence and
   hydrogeological classification of the recharge potential of the
   different units were used to classify the mapped areas into recharge and

   provide a viable source of data comparable with AP for mapping and
   delineating areas of recharge and discharge on a regional scale.}},

   statistically using the R-Student statistic for outlier detection. 
   Under normal climatic conditions, significant annual flow increases were
   found only during the water-year immediately after clearcutting. 
   However, when the water-year following harvesting was extremely dry, no
   flow increase occurred during that year although flow increases were
   found during the second water-year.  Nevertheless, owing to the rapid
   regrowth of the stands, the hydrological effects of clearcutting were
   always short lived.  Depending on the dominant runoff-generating
   processes, increases in total flow were due to increases in both the

Abstract = {{A boron isotope study was carried out on groundwaters from the northern
   Rift Valley, Israel.  The relatively high salinity (18 000 mgCl l-1),
   boron content (3.9 mg l-1), and deltaB-11 value (44parts per thousand)
   and the low B/Cl ratios of the saline Tiberias Hot Spring suggest
   dilution of deep-seated trapped CaCl2 brines with a deltaB-11
   almost-equal-to 44 parts per thousand, which is consistent with previous
   interpretations based on Na/Cl (0.58) and deltaO-18 (-3parts per
   thousand) values.  The deltaB-11 values of the springs in Hammat Gader
   decrease gradually from deltaB-11 of 41.9parts per thousand to 20.9parts
   per thousand with increasing salinity (70 to 497 mgCl l-1), temperature
   (25-degrees-50-degrees-C), and boron content (0.1-0.3 mg l-1).  The
   deltaB-11 values suggest that boron is derived from leaching of calcium
   carbonate or desorption of clay minerals of a deltaB-11 = 14parts per
   thousand and mixing with meteoric water of a high deltaB-11 value.  The
   relatively low deltaB-11 values of two low salinity springs (1240 and
   2700 mgCl l-1) along the Sea of Galilee (deltaB-11 = 31.6parts per
   thousand and 31.8parts per thousand) and the lake itself (24parts per
   thousand) suggest that a significant fraction of boron in these waters
   is also derived from rock leaching.  The influence of boron that is
   leached from the rocks is limited and can be recognized mainly in
   boron-depleted groundwater.  The variations of deltaB-11, Na/Cl, and
   deltaO-18 parameters in the Hammat Gader springs demonstrate the
   sensitivity of each element to different sources.  Whereas
   oxygen-isotope compositions reflect the meteoric source, the major ions
   (e.g. Na/Cl and Br/Cl ratios) record the influence of the deep-seated
   brines, and boron isotopes in diluted groundwater are sensitive to
   water-rock interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Salt karst terrains exist mainly in arid climates where rock salt
   outcrops may escape complete destruction by dissolution.  Such is the
   case with Mount Sedom, on the SW shore of the Dead Sea, one of the most
   arid parts of Israel.  Many small catchments developed over the
   relatively insoluble cap rock which overlies the highly soluble rock
   salt.  The catchments were surveyed and classified.  Some 57\% of the
   surface area is drained by an underground karst system.  Water samples
   from various points in the system were analysed, and water development
   was inferred.  Waters in cave conduits do not reach saturation during
   flood flow, unless the water is ponded for at least several hours. 
   Based on the available evidence, regional karst denudation is
   tentatively estimated to be about 0.5-0.75 mm year-1, occurring mainly
   within the rock salt.}},

Abstract = {{Power can be generated from groundwater by pumping water from one or
   more bores and passing this discharge to a hydro power station located
   at an elevation below the bore water level.  Given a suitable
   hydrogeological environment, a small groundwater power system should be
   more robust against dry periods than a stream-based scheme of the same
   size.  This is relevant, for example, for isolated islands where no
   single stream may provide a sufficiently large and consistent discharge
   for normal hydropower generation.  Large groundwater power schemes may
   be possible in particular topographic and geological configurations in
   high-rainfall environments.  The aquifer here plays the role of a
   storage lake so land inudation can be avoided.  Potential groundwater
   power sites will have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis using
   numerical models, but simple expressions for preliminary power estimates
   can be derived for situations where the Dupuit approximation applies.}},

Abstract = {{A hydrochemical study employing modelling techniques, was carried out
   using samples taken at 65 points (springs and wells) in Triassic
   carbonate aquifers (Lujar-Gador Unit, Alpujarride Complex, Betic
   Cordillera).  These aquifers are made up of limestones and dolomites
   with some gypsum scattered or interbedded.  Though the area is
   semi-arid, recharge is relatively high because of their mountainous
   nature.  The carbonate rocks contain dense microfissuration; the
   groundwater flow regime is predominantly diffuse.  The karstic forms are
   in general poorly developed.  Two main hydrochemical processes have been
   identified in these aquifers.  One is incongruent dissolution of
   dolomite that determines the chemical composition of the less
   mineralised water.  The other is dedolomitisation (dolomite dissolution
   together with calcite precipitation caused by dissolution of gypsum),
   which becomes predominant when the flow encounters interbedded gypsum. 
   This reaction is also frequently associated with low temperature
   thermalism, and can play a part in more intense local karstification
   (cavities, sinkholes, high transmisivity in wells) observed in the
   sectors of these aquifers where gypsum is more abundant.  A reaction
   path model has been used to simulate the geochemical processes through a
   hypothetical aquifer (with similar lithology to the Alpujarride
   carbonate aquifers).  Successive stages of evolution through the
   carbonate sequence, represented by different saturation states with
   respect to calcite, dolomite gypsum and CO2, have been modelled and then
   compared with the field data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the risk of drought and develops drought scenarios
   for use in the study of severe sustained drought in the southwestern
   United States.  The focus is on the Colorado River basin and regions to
   which Colorado River water is exported, especially southern California,
   which depends on water from the Colorado River as well as the four major
   rivers in northern California.  Drought scenarios are developed using
   estimates of unimpaired historic streamflow as well as reconstructions
   of streamflow based on tree ring widths.  Drought scenarios in the
   Colorado River are defined on the basis of annual flow at Lees Ferry. 
   Possible spatial manifestations of the Colorado River drought scenarios
   for input into a Colorado River system simulation model are developed by
   disaggregating the Lees Ferry flow to monthly flows at 29 source
   locations required by the model.  The risk, in terms of return period,
   of the drought scenarios developed, is assessed using stochastic models
   applied to both the Colorado River basin and the combined flow in four
   major California rivers.  The risk of severe sustained drought occurring
   concurrently in the Colorado River basin and California is also
   assessed.}},

Abstract = {{A computationally simple, numerical algorithm capable of solving a wide
   variety of two-dimensional, variably saturated flow problems is
   developed. Recent advances in modeling variably saturated flow are
   incorporated into the algorithm. A physically based form of the general,
   variably saturated flow equation is solved using finite differences
   (centered in space, fully implicit in time) employing the modified
   Picard iteration scheme to determine the temporal derivative of the
   water content. The algorithm avoids mass-balance errors in unsaturated
   regions and is numerically stable. The resulting system of linear
   equations is solved by a preconditioned conjugate gradient method, which
   is known to be computationally efficient for the type of equation set
   obtained. The algorithm is presented in sufficient detail to allow
   others to implement it easily, and is verified using four published,
   illustrative sets of experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical analysis of a transient, two-dimensional (rectangular
   symmetry), unconfined-drainage problem, using a variably saturated flow
   model, shows that the location of the phreatic surface and the height of
   the seepage face are functions of the capillary forces exerted in the
   vadose zone.  A sensitivity analysis investigating the effects of
   independent variations in the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the
   two Van Genuchten parameters is compared to one performed where the
   saturated hydraulic conductivity is functionally related to the Van
   Genuchten parameters.  The relationship between these descriptive soil
   parameters, which may be used to describe the pore-size-density function
   of a porous medium, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is surmised
   based upon limited empirical evidence.  Expressing the permeability as a
   function of these soil properties reverses the sensitivities of the
   variably saturated model to the Van Genuchten parameters.  From the
   preliminary work performed herein, consideration of the number of
   degrees-of-freedom used when performing a sensitivity analysis is shown
   to warrant great care, if the predicted sensitivities are to have
   meaningful physical interpretations.}},

   investigated. This technique is based on integral transforms and does

   produces a continuous and differentiable solution to the groundwater
   flow equation, thus making it possible to obtain conveniently a
   continuous velocity field in three-dimensional (3-D) physical domains
   without any spatial discretization. This velocity field, in conjunction
   with a method of characteristics particle tracking scheme is used to
   solve the advection component of the transport equation. A 3-D transport
   model based on this technique was developed and analyzed for
   effectiveness as a modeling tool. The model was used to study the effect
   of complex 3-D flow on 2-D apparent macrodispersion.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater salinity in deep formations containing saline fluids can be
   estimated using SP logs.  However, values of groundwater salinity
   calculated using traditional methods often deviate from measured values
   of sampled groundwater.  In this study we adopted and modified Smits'
   model for the interpretation of groundwater conductivity (which can be
   correlated with salinity).  The modified approach takes into account
   effects of the clay mineral content and its electrochemical features on
   the electrochemical potential.  Whereas Smits' theoretical model was
   tested under laboratory conditions, its validity under field conditions
   was never established.  We tested this model in four deep boreholes,
   penetrating the Gevanim (Anisian) and the Heletz (Neocomian) formations
   in Israel.  Cores sampled from each formation were analysed for minerals
   as well as for cation exchange capacity, porosity and bulk density. 
   These parameters were later incorporated into the modified Smits
   equations.  Formation-water resistivity was calculated using both the
   traditional and the modified Smits models.  Salinity values in the
   Heletz Formation calculated by each of these methods were similar, and
   very close to the measured values obtained from chemical analysis of
   sampled formation water.  Values calculated by each method in the
   Gevanim Formation were also similar, but lower than the measured value. 
   Findings in the two different formations suggest that the modified Smits
   model does not provide the log interpreter with a more accurate
   analytical tool.  We assume that the reason is that in these formations
   the shale acts as a perfect membrane.  Under these circumstances, the
   modified Smits model offers no advantage over the traditional method.}},

Abstract = {{The seepage from an infinite ponded horizontal surface through a uniform
   soil to a ditch is analysed by the method of conformal transformations. 
   For a ditch maintained empty, the discharge rate per unit length of
   ditch for the case of an infinitely deep soil is simply the hydraulic
   conductivity multiplied by the depth to the ditch base; for the case of
   an impermeable barrier at the level of the ditch base it is reduced to
   0.742 of this value.  When there is water standing to some height in the
   ditch, the seepage rate for the latter situation is shown, both by the
   conformal transformation method and by a simpler analysis of the flow
   problem, initially to decrease slowly with the rise in water level,
   being reduced to only half of its maximum rate when the ditch is 0.8
   full, and then to decrease rapidly to zero when the ditch is full.  The
   results of the analyses show that in all cases the flux through the
   surface decreases rapidly with the distance from the ditch.  The results
   are discussed in the context of the management of areas liable to
   flooding and also of desalinisation methods used in maintaining lands
   under irrigation.}},

Abstract = {{An estimator, based on the use of order statistics, for the coefficient
   of skewness for Pearson Type 3 populations has been previously shown to
   be substantially biased, but frequently less so than is the widely
   applied moment-based estimator suggested by the Water Resources Council.
   The variance of the order statistic-based estimator is also frequently
   much smaller than that of the moment-based estimator, and approaches
   that attainable only by such efficient methods as maximum likelihood. 
   This paper, employing a Bayesian technique, develops a bias correction
   method for the order statistic-based estimator.  The developed bias
   correction method will, in many applications, result in an attenuation
   rather than magnification of the variance of the skewness estimator. 
   Results of this study are presented as graphs of the expected population
   skewness, given the sample skewness and sample size.  It is also shown
   in this paper that, like the moment-based counterpart, the order
   statistic-based estimator is algebraically bounded.  The bounds,
   however, are much less restrictive than they are in the case of the
   moment-based approach.}},

Abstract = {{Measurement of soil moisture content based on changes in dielectric
   constant has become a standard approach in recent years.  Time domain
   reflectrometry (TDR), in particular, has gained rapid acceptance as a
   technique for measuring soil moisture that can be used in a wide range
   of applications.  The capacitance soil moisture probe has been
   demonstrated also to have a large number of potential uses.  One factor
   that dielectric soil moisture determining techniques have in common is
   the need for calibration.  The capacitance probe needs to be calibrated
   for each soil type, and recent research has shown that it is advisable
   for the same strategy to be adopted with time domain reflectometers. 
   Results presented show the influence that iron minerals such as
   magnetite, haematite and goethite can have on the calibration of time
   domain reflectometers and capacitance probes.  Magnetite shows the
   greatest effect by causing an uncertainty of up to 60\% in the
   estimation of volumetric water content in the presence of 15\%
   magnetite.}},

Abstract = {{A Typha-dominated marsh bordering Lake Ontario had a strong hydraulic
   connection with the lake during spring 1991, when the water level was
   more than 10-20 cm above the marsh surface.  During this period,
   water-level changes were dominated by the general decline of Lake
   Ontario, by short-term fluctuations caused by seiche activity (1.7 h
   periodicity) and by setup (diurnal).  These were transmitted into the
   marsh at 65-135 m h-1.  The water surface profile was generally flat
   over the marsh during this period but water depth was uneven owing to
   peat surface adjustment.  High buoyancy of the surface in the 30 m
   margin adjacent to the lake minimized water depth there.  By 21 June,
   water depth at the margin was essentially zero, but elsewhere was
   0.07-0.1 m; all water exchanges between the marsh and lake were
   thereafter constrained to relatively slow subsurface flow (approximately
   10(-3)-10(-4) m h-1).  Short-term fluctuations caused by lake-level
   variability were then restricted to the margin.  The Lake Ontario water
   level then dropped faster than that on the marsh, as did the water table
   on the adjacent mineral terrain, resulting in an upwardly convex water
   surface profile on the marsh, where water flow was away from the marsh. 
   Between 14 June and 6 August, 116 mm of rain and 264 mm of
   evapotranspiration resulted in 30 mm of lateral water loss from the
   marsh centre; only 1 mm was lost at the marsh margin, reflecting the
   frequent reversals of hydraulic gradient there.}},

Abstract = {{Some applications of the Kalman filtering technique in river flow
   forecasting are critically reviewed.  It is argued that when the flow
   forecasting model is assumed to be an autoregressive moving average
   (ARMA) model and the corresponding flow data are considered to be free
   of measurement errors, the minimum mean-square error forecasts obtained
   by using the `conventional' Box and Jenkins-type time series forecasting
   method are identical with those obtained by using the Kalman filtering
   technique.  However, with the assumption of the presence of measurement
   errors in the river flow time series, the use of Kalman filtering
   technique assumes relevance, but this type of application results in
   reduced forecast efficiency as evaluted by the degree of matching
   attained, in the least-squares sense, of the forecasted flows with the
   measured flows.  In the absence of measurement error, referred to as the
   pure prediction scenario, it is demonstrated that a simpler degenerate
   set of Kalman filter equations results, in which the Kalman gain plays
   no part in the prediction, i.e. the application of the general Kalman
   filter becomes redundant.}},

Abstract = {{The late Albian-Turonian Judea Group carbonate aquifer is one of the
   most important resources of fresh groundwater in the northern Negev and
   in the central part of Israel.  Over three decades ago, various
   hydrological, hydrochemical, hydrometeorological and geological aspects
   of this aquifer were thoroughly investigated and served to build up the
   professional background and data base for the management of this
   resource.  Notwithstanding the accumulating structural, hydrogeological
   and hydrochemical evidence, the conceptual hydrogeological model of the
   Yarkon-Taninim basin (which constitutes the western part of the Judea
   Group aquifer) has neither been questioned nor updated.  Therefore, the
   existing and accepted model of this basin should in the best case only
   depict general features and trends.  The present review critically
   examines the main hitherto accepted hydrogeological conventions, points
   out puzzling and contradictory phenomena and emphasizes questionable
   issues.  Although the present review deals with problems related to a
   specific groundwater basin, the methods and effort for breaking
   long-established conventions may serve as an example for similar
   situations, in other places, in which water resources are managed
   according to long-established concepts and traditions without being
   periodically revised and reassessed in view of accumulating knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Decades of acid deposition in the Galloway area, southwestern Scotland,
   have resulted in acidification of surface waters and damage to fish.  In
   the period since 1980, however, acidic deposition has decreased
   substantially.  A survey of 50 lochs conducted in 1979 and repeated in
   1988 reveals major changes in water chemistry over this 9 year period. 
   Together these two data sets separated in time by 9 years and covering a
   period of relatively large and rapid change in acid deposition offer a
   valuable basis for the evaluation of acidification models. 
   Concentrations of SO4 in the lochs were on the average 42\% lower in
   1988 relative to 1979.  The decline is readily explained by the large
   and rapid decline in sulphate concentrations in precipitation in the
   area.  Concentrations of non-marine base cations decreased from 155 to
   90 muequiv 1(-1) and acid neutralising capacity (ANC) increased.  The
   change in ANC was due mostly to decreased concentrations of Al. pH
   levels showed no systematic change from 1979 to 1988.  The regional
   changes in water chemistry over the period 1979-1988 are corroborated by
   regular measurements at several of these lochs over this 9 year period. 
   MAGIC (Model for Acidification of Groundwater In Catchments)
   successfully reproduces the major changes in water chemistry observed
   over the period 1979-1988.  Both calibration to the 1979 data with
   prediction of 1988, and calibration to the 1988 with reconstruction of
   1979 give close fits to the observations.  The model provides a means by
   which the future impact of acidic deposition and afforestation can be
   evaluated.  A fish response function coupled to MAGIC provides the basis
   for evaluation of past and future fish status in the region.  MAGIC
   predictions under different acid deposition and forestry scenarios
   indicate that if acidic deposition is held constant at 1988 levels,
   afforestation causes further acidification of the lochs.  Acidic
   deposition emerges as the major cause of soil and water acidification in
   the Galloway region, although forestry practices can exacerbate the
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{The Lower Mersey Basin Permo-Triassic Sandstone Aquifer lies in a
   heavily urbanised and industrial area of NW England.  Extensive pumping
   has lowered the piezometric surface considerably, causing the sandstone
   aquifer, which is overlain by a variable sequence of glacial deposits,
   to become extensively unconfined.  The groundwater chemistry of the
   system appears to be controlled by the geometry of the sandstones,
   faulting, the variable distribution and permeability of the Quaternary
   deposits, and by the pumping.  The water in the present-day recharge
   areas is affected by pollution, with high NO3, SO4, and Cl
   concentrations; it has pH values as low as 4.3.  The oldest fresh waters
   in the area (age less than a few thousand years) are strongly ion
   exchanged as a result of the flushing of saline water from the system: 
   these waters grade into similar but much less ion exchanged waters, with
   zero NO3, very low SO4, and high HCO3.  A fourth group of waters appears
   to be the result of mixing between the latter waters and pumping-induced
   leakage through the Quaternary deposits.  A final group of waters is
   characterised by very low alkalinity and is strongly associated with
   particular geological units poor in carbonates.  Minor-ion distributions
   confirm the patterns suggested by the major ions.  The distribution of
   the water chemistry preserves some of the features of the pre-pumping
   system in this low-transmissivity-high storage system, and
   reconstruction of the pre-pumping chemical distributions is attempted,
   to highlight the effects of industrial man on the system.}},

   EVIDENCE FROM THE OBEY RIVER, NORTH-CENTRAL TENNESSEE}},

Abstract = {{The production of acidic drainage from active or abandoned coal mines is
   controlled by a complex series of reactions triggered by the oxidation
   of sulphide minerals.  Limestone is frequently used as a neutralizing
   agent; neutralization occurs both through dissolution of the limestone
   and exsolution of carbon dioxide from the water.
   Demonstration of these processes in a natural system is provided by the
   East Fork of the Obey River, where acidic mine waters travel through
   conduits in limestone bedrock for several kilometers.  Application of
   discharge-concentration relationships allows tracking of the evolution
   of these waters within the karst aquifer.  Several trends are evident. 
   Virtually all of the iron in the acid mine drainage is precipitated
   along the flow path within the limestone; the H+ released during this
   reaction, together with the H+ generated by pyrite oxidation, is largely
   neutralized by both exsolution of CO2 and dissolution of
   calcite/dolomite in the carbonate bedrock (releasing calcium and
   magnesium).  Nevertheless, the pH is still sufficiently low that all
   bicarbonate is converted to carbonic acid.  Leaching of clay minerals by
   the acid waters releases small amounts of Al and Si; the species Cl-, F-
   and NO3- are more or less inert.  The sulphate concentration
   substantially increases during evolution of the acid drainage; this
   seems to be related to an input of sulphate-enriched waters that have
   dissolved gypsum/anhydrite as they follow deep flow paths within the
   limestone.
   Calculations of the relative proportions of H+ removed by reaction with
   calcite/dolomite and CO2 degassing show that the latter is important in
   acidic waters that have reacted significantly with limestone and can
   readily lose CO2 to the atmosphere.  These results indicate that acid
   neutralization through carbonic acid dissociation, in addition to
   neutralization through dissolution of carbonates, is a useful method for
   the commercial abatement of acid mine drainage.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements in a forest podzol show that soil physical properties
   differ predictably between major soil horizons which have been clearly
   identified in pits.  Even in this `best' case, there is considerable
   variability in those physical properties.  The method by which soil is
   sampled for measurement of physical properties is shown to introduce
   uncertainty into the measured variable values.  It is shown that soil
   horizons locally thicken into `funnels' where the thickness of A and B
   horizons increases by many times.  It is shown that these `funnels' are
   related to surface microtopography at the scale of metres, and it is
   suggested that these soil `funnels' represent preferential nodes of
   infiltration.  In soil sampling exercises where a time sequence of cores
   is taken at different locations in order to characterize temporal change
   in some variable, the structures described introduce a large element of
   uncertainty, in that the difference between two cores is a combination
   of temporal and spatial change in unknown relative proportions.}},

Abstract = {{A zone of transport for a well is defined as the area in the horizontal
   plane bounded by a contour of equal ground-water travel time to the
   well.  For short distances and ground-water travel times near a well,
   the potentiometric surface may be simulated analytically as that for a
   fully penetrating well in a uniform flow field.  The zone of transport
   for this configuration is nearly elliptical.  A simple method is derived
   to calculate a travel-time ellipse that approximates the zone of
   transport for a well in a uniform flow field.  The travel-time ellipse
   was nearly congruent with the exact solution for the theoretical zone of
   transport for ground-water travel times of at least 10 years and for
   aquifer property values appropriate for southeastern Minnesota.  For
   distances and travel times approaching infinity, however, the ellipse
   becomes slightly wider at its midpoint and narrower near its upgradient
   boundary than the theoretical zone of transport.  The travel-time
   ellipse also may be used to simulate the plume area surrounding an
   injection well.  However, the travel-time ellipse is an approximation
   that does not account for the effect of dispersion in enlarging the true
   area of an injection plume or zone of transport; hence, caution is
   advised in the use and interpretation of this simple construction.}},

Abstract = {{Previous measurements of water loss from small-dish evaporimeters
   mounted at the height of irrigated crops grown under conditions of
   extreme local advection in the Sudan are reexamined. From these
   evaporimeter measurements, it is possible to calculate fractional
   changes in the saturation deficit. Relationships between canopy
   conductance and saturation deficit are briefly reviewed and introduced
   into the Penman-Monteith equation to calculate transpiration rates as a
   function of distance downwind of the boundary between the upwind desert
   and the irrigated crop. In contradiction to most theoretical
   predictions, these new calculations show rates of transpiration to
   undergo only modest changes with increasing fetch. This occurs because
   of the feedback interaction between saturation deficit and stomatal
   conductance. This result is in good accord with a recent study
   suggesting that a dry-moist boundary transition may be best modelled as
   a simple step change in surface fluxes and further that the advective
   enhancement of evaporation may have been overestimated by many advection
   models. Larger effects are expected on dry matter yields because of the
   direct influence of saturation deficit on the yield-transpiration ratio.}},

   moisture and direct surface runoff due to global warming.  An analytical
   model of the soil moisture balance based on our previous work is used to
   evaluate the probability distribution of the soil moisture concentration
   and resulting surface runoff.  The input of hydroclimatic values is
   based on the approach suggested by C.W. Richardson in 1981.  Our results
   show that not only the mean of the distribution of both soil moisture
   and runoff change, as expected, but that the variability of the values
   around the means also changes.  The results of our research have
   immediate applications on the planning of reservoir operation for
   irrigation demands and evaluation of the change in surface runoff

   accumulations on periodic sampling of the rainfield is investigated.  It
   is shown that errors due to sampling can be greater than all the other
   errors combined if accumulations are improperly computed.  However, if
   the movement and the development of the storms are taken into account,
   these errors can be reduced dramatically.  Using an accumulation method
   taking storm movement and evolution into account, the space and time
   resolution of radar maps resulting in the most accurate 5 min
   accumulations over areas smaller than 1 km2 was determined.  It is shown
   that the best accumulations are obtained with very high time resolution
   data.  Furthermore, for a given time resolution, there is an optimum
   spatial resolution that minimizes rainfall accumulation errors.}},

   conventional meteorological and land use data. The modeled solutions of
   soil water content become independent of their starting conditions after
   a few weeks to a few months into a simulation depending on rainfall and
   evapotranspiration. Once the model becomes free of its initial
   conditions (a state to which we refer as `balanced'), the model is
   driven almost completely by current environmental conditions. Two sets
   of data were used to validate the model which showed close agreement
   between simulations and measurements. This paper presents the details of
   the water budget model and verifications from two field experiments.}},

Title = {{FORMATION OF A SALT PLUME IN THE COASTAL-PLAIN AQUIFER OF ISRAEL - THE
   BEER-TOVIYYA REGION}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{160}},
Number = {{1-4}},

Abstract = {{The formation and development of a salt plume (salinity up to 800 mg Cl
   l-1) in the inner part of the Coastal Plain aquifer of Israel is
   analyzed. Massive groundwater exploitation during the 1950s caused a
   large drop in the water level and formation of a hydrologic depression
   in the Be'er Toviyya-Kefar Warburg area. The depression reached a
   maximal depth during the late 1960s; thereafter a reduction in the rate
   of pumpage led to restoration of water levels and shallowing of the
   depression, until its complete disappearance towards the end of the
   1980s. A spot of high salinity first appeared in 1956, following a deep
   drawdown in the water levels. This saline plume has been continuously
   expanding with increasing salinity concentrations (200-800 mg Cl l-1) in
   its center. The average rate of radial expansion was about 50 m year-1.
   The expansion and salinization did not cease as the depression
   disappeared. Rather, equalization of water levels in wells situated
   within the plume area with those of situated along its margins resulted
   in the salinization of the latter within a period of 1 year.
   Mass balances for water and chloride contents were made for the period
   1967-1990. Taking into consideration the storage change, pumpage,
   natural replenishment and artificial recharge, the lateral inflow to the
   depression is estimated as 60 x 10(6) m3. Upon addition of the chloride
   balance, and taking into consideration the chloride concentrations of
   the surrounding fresh water and the apparent possible end-member of the
   saline source (based on geochemical considerations), the saline inflow
   is estimated as (40-60) x 10(6). These estimates indicate that a large
   amount of salinewater penetrated into the aquifer, of about half of the
   natural replenishment of the study area, with an estimated salinity of
   1900-2700 mg Cl l-1.
   It is suggested that the salt plume was formed as a result of a drop in
   water level combined with a flow of underlying saline water bodies from
   deeper strata. The chemical composition of the groundwater points to the
   existence of two saline water bodies of Ca-chloride composition and a
   marine Br/Cl ratio: (1) saline water with low Na/Cl (0.6), SO4/Cl, and
   B/Cl ratio; (2) saline water with higher Na/Cl (> 0.6), SO4/Cl, and B/Cl
   ratios. These chemical compositions resemble Ca-chloride saline waters
   found in other locations in the Coastal Plain aquifer and in underlying
   formations. The saline water bodies may occur in either pockets at the
   bottom of the aquifer or lumachelle and sandstone layers of high
   hydraulic conductivity in underlying sediments.}},

Abstract = {{Factors controlling acidity were studied in the acidic River Lillan in
   the coastal zone of central northern Sweden.The stream drains the hilly
   wave-washed terrain and the sediment-covered coastal plain which are the
   dominating types of landscape in the region. A synoptic study of 38
   small streams, representing both types of landscape was also made.
   Acidity in all streams is caused by organic acids in combination with
   catchment sources of sulfate. The most acidic streams occur in the hilly
   terrain because of a high terrestrial export of organic acids and low
   buffering capacity. Acidic episodes during snowmelt were associated with
   strongly decreased base cation concentrations, decreased SO42- and
   slightly increased organic acids concentrations. Frequently occurring
   acid episodes caused by rainstorms and associated outwash of organic
   acids from forest soils are typical for events in late summer and
   autumn. It is suggested that, in all essential aspects, the acidity in
   surface waters in this part of Sweden is of natural origin.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical flood frequency analysis assumes that the flood record to be
   analysed is a reliable set of measurements of independent random events
   from a stationary population. The validity of this assumption can be
   verified using statistical tests of independence. However, most
   statistical tests of independence are designed to show up only
   short-term serial correlation. They are insensitive to the long-term
   serial correlation structure of the flood record which can be far more
   important. To demonstrate this issue, the serial correlation structure
   of the peak flow series from 90 Canadian rivers was analysed for both
   short- and long-term dependence. The results show that although
   short-term dependence is practically absent for most of the peak flow
   series, significant long-term dependence is present for a large number
   of peak flow series tested.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the spread of groundwater pollution demands a detailed
   understanding of the physical, chemical and microbial processes that
   control contaminant mobility in aquifers. Many field studies have been
   carried out around pollutant sources in an attempt to understand these
   processes, but quantitative results are often difficult to obtain
   because of the number of assumptions that have to be made about the flow
   regime or the source term which has given rise to the pollution. Models
   can be constructed with emphases on different processes to describe the
   known distribution of contaminants at any one time. However, if these
   models are to be used for predictive purposes, or to help remediation,
   it is important to identify and quantify individual processes precisely
   by independent or direct methods and not to rely on inference alone.
   Laboratory tests suffer from the fact that aquifer material has to be
   sampled and transferred to the laboratory. In the process, the sample
   may be disturbed physically thus altering its porosity, permeability and
   dispersive properties. It may be oxidised, thereby altering its
   chemistry, and the numbers, activity and character of any microbial
   population may change. In situ tracer experiments attempt to overcome
   the limitations of the laboratory by maintaining natural conditions, but
   at the same time allowing the injection of solute to be accurately
   defined and the hydraulic regime to be well controlled and monitored.
   Examples are given showing how integrated laboratory and field
   approaches have been used to study: (1) organic degradation in a
   pollution plume resulting from the disposal of industrial wastes and (2)
   the role of colloids in transporting radionuclides in an intergranular
   aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of groundwater contamination by chlorinated solvents is
   widespread throughout the industrialised world. Because these solvents
   have a density greater than water, the sources of contaminant
   groundwater plumes in many cases are expected to be pools and zones of
   residual solvent that are located below the water table. A tracer
   experiment designed to provide a simplified simulation of the above
   scenario has been conducted at the University of Waterloo Borden field
   site. A homogeneous block of sand containing residual solvent at 5\%
   residual saturation of the pore space was emplaced 1 m below the water
   table. This source zone measured 1.5 x 1 x 0.5 m and contained a mixture
   of chloroform (TCM), trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE)
   and gypsum powder to provide sulfate as a conservative inorganic tracer.
   Subsequent groundwater flow through the source zone created a continuous
   plume of dissolved solutes down-gradient. The plume was monitored by a
   three-dimensional array of over 2300 sampling points and after 15 months
   extended 60 m from the source. This paper presents an overview of the
   experiment, with field results of source dissolution and dissolved-phase
   plume transport. The field results were selected to give an indication
   of the complexity of the observed field data. Some preliminary modeling
   of the data to estimate the approximate magnitude of dispersion
   parameters and comparison of these values with other tracer tests is
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{In 1976, there occurred a substantial loss of diesel oil from a storage
   facility at Royston in eastern England. The site is on the outcrop of
   the important Chalk aquifer, which is protected by an unsaturated zone
   24-30 m thick. In 1986, a cored borehole was drilled through the site of
   the spillage to investigate the fate of the contaminants. The core
   samples were analysed by physical and chemical methods to determine the
   physical structure of the rock, and the characteristics and distribution
   of the oil. The chemically analysed samples included pore water
   extracts, scrapings from fracture surfaces, and non-fracture (matrix)
   samples.
   The results indicate that oil accumulated within a few millimetres of
   major fissure surfaces, and entry into the rock matrix was limited by
   the small size of pores and the presence of water. Oil may also have
   migrated along microscopic channels away from the major fissures. There
   was no evidence of downward migration of oil since the initial phase of
   movement. The adoption of certain assumptions regarding degradation,
   evaporation and dissolution processes allows the estimation of oil
   depletion caused by these processes. Physical weathering and degradation
   were found to have been extensive, but highly variable. Both processes
   occurred on the major fissure surfaces but, in the matrix, degradation
   appears to have been restricted. The conclusions have implications for
   the investigation and remediation of fissured Chalk aquifers
   contaminated by oil.}},

Abstract = {{At the environmental field site Horkheimer Insel numerous pumping tests
   were performed at different investigation scales. The measured
   time-drawdown curves exhibit a characteristic segmentation into two or
   three drawdown phases. Since the site is highly heterogeneous it was
   intended to take advantage of the non-stationarity of the flow field
   during pumping tests in order to determine the effective length scale of
   the subsurface heterogeneity structure. The time-drawdown curves were
   evaluated using the Theis' analytical solution, which, however, yields
   different aquifer parameters for the different drawdown phases. Because
   this solution does not satisfy the properties of the test site aquifer
   totally, some of the inferred parameter distributions are regarded as
   suitable only for a relative comparison rather than representing `true'
   effective parameters. Based on a definition of spatial and temporal
   scale, a statistical description along with a qualitative interpretation
   of the parameter distributions determined is provided. The results
   indicate that the effective length scale of the heterogeneity structure
   can be estimated from pumping test data. However, it is believed that
   for a quantitative interpretation of the field data, the application of
   numerical methods is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{At the Horkheimer Insel experimental field site, several short to
   intermediate distance forced and natural gradient tracer tests with
   depth-integrated and multilevel sampling were conducted to characterize
   the aquifer transport properties. Compared with other test sites, the
   aquifer at the Horkheimer Insel is highly heterogeneous and highly
   conductive. Hence, new tracer measurement techniques had to be
   developed. This paper presents some of the instrumentation developed
   together with measurements and their initial interpretation. The results
   demonstrate that for contaminant transport predictions in highly
   heterogeneous and highly conductive aquifers, investigation techniques
   with a high resolution in time and space are needed. The aquifer
   heterogeneity is evident from the spatial variability of peak
   concentration, transport velocity and longitudinal macrodispersivity
   values obtained from the tracer tests. Furthermore, the tracer test
   results indicate that at the observation scale investigated, a complex
   numerical flow and transport model is needed to describe adequately mass
   transport within the heterogeneous aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a stochastic numerical modelling procedure to
   simulate dispersion of a conservative solute in two-dimensional
   heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields is investigated in a series
   of numerical experiments, the results of which are compared with
   theoretical predictions. Random hydraulic conductivity fields are
   generated with a prescribed statistical structure, a finite difference
   model is used to obtain the flow field and particle tracking reproduces
   the dispersive properties.
   For comparison between stochastic numerical methods and stochastic
   theories for solute transport, fulfilment of the ergodic requirement is
   necessary, consequently aspects of simulated solute plume behaviour are
   investigated with respect to ergodicity. Application of numerical
   stochastic methods is hampered by the large associated computational
   burden, which is affected by a range of factors, not least the level of
   discretisation of the hydraulic conductivity field. The experiments
   detailed here investigate the effects of hydraulic conductivity
   discretisation and the effects of initial solute source area for a range
   of log-permeability variances. An increasing deviation from Dagan's
   linear theory is observed for increasing coarseness of discretisation. A
   tendency to ergodic conditions is found for a smaller initial source
   area than previously reported.}},

Abstract = {{To model bacterially catalyzed redox processes a multicomponent
   transport reaction model is presented. The transport part of the model
   solves the transient convection dispersion differential equations. The
   pure chemical submodel is conceptually similar to conventional
   thermodynamic equilibrium models. The kinetic submodel describes the
   heterotrophic metabolisms of several groups of microorganisms. To model
   a complete redox sequence (aerobic carbonaceous oxidation,
   denitrification, Fe(III)-reduction, Mn(IV)-reduction, and sulfate
   reduction) four functional bacterial groups are defined. Their growth
   and metabolisms are formulated in terms of Monod equations. As in other
   biofilm models, diffusion-limited exchange between the different phases
   (mobile pore water, biophase, and aquifer material) is also considered
   in this approach. The submodels are coupled by the equations of the
   microbially mediated redox reactions. This numerical technique permits
   direct mechanistic modeling of the influence of microbially catalyzed
   redox reactions on the chemical milieu of an aquifer. A two-step method
   is applied to solve the coupled transport and biochemical reaction
   equations. The numerical model was applied to field data of a natural
   subsurface flow path.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional mathematical model for simulating the transport and
   fate of chemicals in aquifers with spatially heterogeneous but isotropic
   fluid flow properties was developed, as part of an evaluation of
   bioremediation technologies that include injection of reactants into the
   aquifer. An important physical process is dispersion of the injected
   reactant in the aquifer. Dispersion was simulated with the model which
   has user-prescribed hydraulic pressure fields at the inflow and outflow
   boundaries. The model accounts for the major physical processes of
   dispersion and advection and several fundamental chemical and biological
   processes, including linear equilibrium sorption, irreversible sorption
   and/or dissolution into an organic phase, microbial degradation,
   radioactive decay, and other irreversible processes. The chemical may be
   released internally via distributed leaks from sources that do not
   perturb the flow field, from fully penetrating injection wells, or it
   may enter at the inlet boundary. The chemical transport and fate
   equations are solved in terms of user-stipulated initial and boundary
   conditions.
   Simulations were made to evaluate dispersion resulting from spatial
   variability in the hydraulic conductivity (K). Flow fields were divided
   into regions with hydraulic conductivities of 0.2, 2.0 and 20 m day-1.
   Distributions of chemical, initially present as a distributed source
   near the inflow boundary, were obtained for several geometries of the
   hydraulic conductivity regions. Results show the influence on
   distributions of regions of low, medium, and high K; they demonstrate
   the importance of knowledge about the hydraulic conductivity field, both
   for interpretation of sampling data and for prediction of plume
   behaviour in terms of direction of movement, dispersion and rate of
   travel.}},

Abstract = {{A model is presented which yields the range of the hydraulic parameters
   that are critical for the collapse of continuous macropores in a given
   soil under certain hydrological circumstances. These continuous
   macropores are important, as they control the hydraulic conductivity at
   saturation and the infiltration capacity of most soils.
   The conceptual model is based on data from earlier infiltration
   experiments on soil columns in situ; it consists basically of a soil
   matrix with discontinuous macropores which is traversed by a vertical
   macropore channel. The experiments suggested that under the transient
   flow conditions that occur in the soil when ponded infiltration ends,
   the wall of a macropore channel can become unstable. Collapse will occur
   if the shear stress caused by the seepage to the channel exceeds the
   shear strength of the soil particles in the wall of the macropore
   channel. The model ascertains the magnitude of this shear stress from
   the transient gradient of the hydraulic head G over a length L which is
   the distance between the wall of the macropore channel and air
   encapsulated by the water in the soil matrix.
   For given parameters L, k (hydraulic conductivity) and mu (specific
   storativity) the behaviour of G as a function of time is derived from
   the equation for non-stationary, horizontal flow of soil water. The
   solution consists of a series of exponential functions; one term is
   characterized by the emptying time of the macropore channel and the
   others by the relaxation time tau = 4L2mu/pi2k.
   It is shown how, for a certain soil, a domain of k and mu values
   conducive to collapse can be found. Each point within this domain
   defines a length scale for L. The moment of collapse is found to be
   proportional to square-root pi. The domains of k, mu and L are
   determined for three different soil textures (silt loam, sandy loam and
   loamy sand). The application of the model shows that ponded infiltration
   can create conditions appropriate for the collapse of macropores and,
   therefore, for the decrease of the saturated conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Fingers in homogeneous coarse-grained soils form from an instability in
   the wetting front and result in bypass flow which shortens the residence
   time in the vadose zone. Once formed, these fingers persist over a long
   period. In this paper, the formation of fingers and their persistence in
   initially uniform dry or wet soils are examined. Using fast-responding
   tensiometers in conjunction with rapid moisture measurements, it is
   shown that the matric potential at the finger tip and the position of
   the wetting curve relative to the drying curve are key factors in the
   persistence of the fingers. In accordance with the earlier observation,
   the tip and the fringes of the finger are on a wetting curve, while the
   remaining core of the finger is on a drying branch. This explains why
   large differences in moisture content can co-exist. This study also
   shows that the initial water content in and around the finger is
   crucially important in relation to which particular scanning curve is
   followed and, thus, to the water contents during infiltration.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports a direct comparison of nitrate leaching on a field
   scale from a sandy soil overlying a relatively impermeable glacial till
   (K(sat) = 30-50 mm day-1), with that from a clay loam soil overlying a
   similar glacial till (K(sat) = 2-8 mm day-1), under nearly identical
   climatic and cropping conditions. Drained plots were installed at each
   site, and N application rate on the plots, which grew spring barley,
   varied from 0 to 210 kg N ha-1. Nitrate concentrations in drainage water
   from the two sites were measured using a simple flow-weighted sampling
   device and drainflow was measured using tipping bucket flow meters.
   Total leaching losses (including an estimate of deep percolation) in the
   first year of the comparison were not significantly higher on the sandy
   site (38 +/- 11 kg N ha-1 at 1 50 kg N ha-1 N fertiliser application)
   than on the clay loam site (27 +/- 4 kg N ha-1). In the subsequent 2
   years, leaching losses increased at the sandy loam site. At the clay
   loam site leaching losses were much lower (7-11 kg N ha-1 in the final
   year). Timing of cultivation was an important factor influencing the
   amount of leaching in the clay loam soil. The effect of applied N
   fertiliser on nitrate leaching was small at both sites, except in the
   final year at the sandy site, which leached 105 kg N ha-1 at the highest
   fertiliser rate. The interpretation of these results was aided by
   concurrent chloride leaching experiments. These experiments showed that
   the residence time of a substantial proportion of chloride (40-50\%) was
   longer than 1 year. This may be because of diffusion and slow convection
   into the glacial till horizons, where the residence time is long.}},

Abstract = {{The quality of water in Estonian rivers in the spring is influenced
   strongly by the conditions in the catchments, and in particular by the
   amount of ice within the soil. After cold winters, the soil is
   extensively frozen and surface runoff predominates. After warmer
   winters, water flows through the soil and leaches pollutants from the
   soil. Increased pollutant load to Matsalu Bay has been identified by
   calibrating a water quality model for the period 1959-1966 and then
   running the same model for a test period (1977-1991). The observed
   concentrations during the test period were higher than those predicted
   by the calibrated model, indicating a real increase in pollutant load.}},

Abstract = {{Simple mixing models are widely used to explain temporal variations in
   streamwater chemistry and to infer the relative contributions of old and
   new water during runoff events. These models assume conservative mixing
   of fixed end members and ignore solute uptake while new water is
   resident in the ground. A simple modelling approach is proposed which
   combines two-component mixing with solute uptake using a first-order
   kinetic rate equation. In this approach new and old water have the same
   origin in precipitation but old water, by virtue of its longer residence
   time, is more enriched. Equations are presented and illustrated for
   predicting the chemical evolution of old, new and mixed water and for
   inferring new water contributions. One consequence of the model is that
   solute rating plots do not exhibit a unique and reversible
   concentration-discharge relationship but a set of shifted
   counter-clockwise loops. Methods of parameter estimation are discussed.
   If intensive time-series data are not available, estimation of the
   chemical uptake parameter is not possible for a single solute but is
   possible for two solutes given information on several runoff events.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was established on plot lysimeters in autumn 1989 to
   examine the loss of pesticides from a cracking clay soil. Emphasis was
   placed on the movement of two autumn/spring-applied herbicides with
   contrasting properties - isoproturon and mecoprop. The first major
   drainflows in autumn/winter were important for the transport of these
   herbicides. During the dry autumns of 1989 and 1990, the development of
   substantial subsoil cracks led to rapid vertical movement of water,
   through the soil-cracks to the drainage system, before field capacity
   was reached. Isoproturon was detected in the resultant drainflow at
   concentrations of up to 50 mug l-1, well above the EC Directive for
   potable waters. Mecoprop was not detected. Measurements of herbicide
   degradation in soil indicated that isoproturon was rather persistent and
   hence available over many months for transport to the drainage system.
   In contrast, the long delay between application and the onset of
   drainflow, combined with the much faster degradation of mecoprop,
   resulted in this herbicide not occurring in drainflow. Although the site
   was some distance from a supply point for potable water, the loss of
   such concentrations of isoproturon in the early drainage flush could
   have undesirable consequences for water supplies and for the ecology of
   adjacent water courses.}},

Abstract = {{The budgets of major dissolved nutrients have been determined in a small
   micaschist catchment (0.34 km2) covered with Mediterranean shrubs and
   afforested pines at 1560 m altitude in the Filabres range (southeast
   Spain). The climate is semiarid with 395 mm annual rainfall and
   12-degrees-C annual mean temperature. During the hydrological year
   1988-1989, major element concentrations in open field precipitation,
   throughfall, stemflow and runoff were recorded as well as the element
   fluxes of the main solutes. The total rainfall recorded during the
   sampling year was 650 mm of which 86\% was lost through
   evapotranspiration and 14\% through runoff. Mean annual rainfall
   interception is estimated as 15\% and net rainfall reaching the soil is
   divided between 90\% throughfall and 10\% stemflow.
   Two methods were applied to compute bulk precipitation inputs to the
   ionic balances: (I) bulk open field deposition was estimated from data
   provided by open field polyethylene collectors (bulk open field
   precipitation inputs); (II) net throughfall and stemflow were corrected
   for canopy leaching. The results show that the total deposition
   calculated using balance (II) is higher than that calculated by (I); the
   effect of canopy surfaces in scavenging atmospheric dry fallouts and
   gases is identified in a more efficient way than by simple polyethylene
   collectors. When comparing both methods of computing balances in several
   environments, using published data, the authors conclude that the plant
   canopy effect is larger in sermiarid areas with dusty atmospheres and in
   industrial regions with higher concentrations of sulphur. These
   conclusions suggest that the retention of nutrients within the ecosystem
   may be more widespread than was previously thought. This calls for more
   research on the assessment of biomass removal and the dynamics of
   intermediate pools (precipitates). Consequently, it throws doubts on
   most of the figures available for catchment weathering rates; these were
   often estimated by difference between bulk open field precipitation
   inputs measured with polyethylene collectors and runoff outputs.}},

Abstract = {{The small drainage basin of Cal Parisa was instrumented in early 1989 to
   study the hydrological and sediment routing behaviour of Mediterranean
   mountain areas formerly used for agriculture but now abandoned.
   Environmental changes produced by agricultural land use included the
   construction of terraces on the major part of the basin and subsequent
   artificial channelling of surface waters. Field observations and
   hydrological data suggest that storm runoff is generated by the
   contributing role of saturated areas, most of them originating from the
   terrace system. Modelling of the natural conditions before terracing,
   with the help of TOPMODEL, supports the hypothesis that terracing
   promotes the premature formation of saturated areas, increasing
   saturation overland flow at the expense of lower baseflow and actual
   evapotranspiration. Now, after land abandonment, the more relevant
   environmental hazard is linked to the spontaneous reorganization of the
   unmaintained artificial drainage network.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial variability of rainfall is often considered as a major source of
   temporal variability in the resulting basin hydrograph. Since direct
   experimental evidence is not available, this must be verified through a
   modelling approach, provided adequate data are available. A
   semi-distributed version of TOPMODEL has therefore been applied to the
   Real Collobrier experimental basin (71 km2 in southeast France with 21
   recording raingauges) using an hourly time step and a series of
   independent events. First, a set of reference results has been built
   under the assumption of spatial uniformity for the rainfall. Two
   different densities of network have been tested (including 5 or 21
   gauges), showing a significant advantage for the dense network rainfall
   estimate. Next, the spatial variability of the rainfall field has been
   tested and confirmed, with commonly a factor of 3 between simultaneous
   average rainfall over subcatchment areas of 6-8 km2. However, the model
   response reflects this spatial variability only in secondary peaks which
   are usually an order of magnitude smaller than the bulk of the
   hydrograph and not always present in the observed discharges. An
   extended discussion considers if these results may be dependent on the
   model or on the setting up of the numerical experiments. In fact, it
   seems that the spatial variability of rainfall, although important, is
   not sufficiently organized in time and space to overcome the effects of
   smoothing and dampening when running off through this rural medium-sized
   catchment. Such results may not hold for smaller urbanized areas or
   larger rural basins.}},

Abstract = {{The two-layer format common to perennial streambeds, in which a
   relatively coarse armour overlies a finer subarmour, develops as a
   function of both the ingress and subsequent near-surface winnowing of
   interstitial material and the selective non-entrainment or slower
   transport velocity of coarse clasts. Ephemeral streams appear to lack
   such vertical layering or are characterized by weak layer development.
   Some of this may be due to the degree of mixing associated with the
   scour-and-fill process. However, continuous monitoring of bedload
   discharge in the Nahal Yatir in the northern Negev Desert reveals that
   sediment transport rates are extremely high so that the chance of armour
   layer development through selective non-entrainment is much reduced.
   Indeed, a comparison of the bedload and bed material size-distributions
   confirms a high degree of similarity and hints at equal mobility
   regardless of clast size. The monitoring programme also indicates that
   the bed becomes highly mobile at comparatively modest fluid shear, so
   that practically all floods are associated with high transport rates.
   Consequently, the winnowing that might be brought about by low
   transport-rate events does not occur. Even within a single event,
   winnowing is precluded by the rapid nature of flow recession that is so
   characteristic of flash-floods. The high degree of bed material mobility
   is attributable, in part, to the lack of strength that would otherwise
   be a corollary of armour development. However, it also highlights the
   divergent nature of the feedback loops that govern the relationship
   between flow and channel deposit in ephemeral and perennial systems.}},

Abstract = {{The draw-down of Pinmacher Reservoir (Ayrshire, west Scotland) in 1988
   exposed sedimentary sequences entrapped since impoundment in 1903. The
   sole surface influent, an ungauged second-order stream, drains a mainly
   undisturbed, upland catchment. Most of the floor of the small basin is
   coated with mud. However, below the inflow a normally subaqueous delta
   of gravelly sand has accumulated. Examination of sections has enabled
   the construction of an isopachyte map from which the volume of deposits
   has been evaluated. Taking account of trap efficiency, sediment water
   content and bulk densities, the total sediment yield from the Pinmacher
   catchment is 51.1 t km-2 year-1. On the assumption that the deltaic and
   lacustrine sequences, respectively, represent the bed and suspended
   fractions of the influent stream load, long-term (85 years) average
   yields for the two components of 23.3 t km-2 year-1 and 27.8 t km-2
   year-1 may be discriminated. Thus, bedload accounts for ca. 46\% of the
   total load. Whilst the quantification of long-term bedload transport
   remains elusive, this study provides an unusually long record. Moreover,
   analysis of the delta stratigraphy demonstrates two major and 21
   additional flood events during the history of impoundment.}},

Abstract = {{Lillooet River drains 3850 km2 of partly glacier-covered terrain before
   entering Lillooet Lake in the southern Coast Mountains of British
   Columbia. The elongated lake covers an area of 21 km 2 and forms a deep
   basin with water depths to 137 m. Acoustic profiling of the subbottom
   and sampling of the surface sediments reveals that total sediment
   thickness varies from 30 + m in the north half of the lake near Lillooet
   delta and then declines to less than 16 m in the south. Up-valley ice
   retreat approximately 11 000 years BP resulted in conformable sediments
   in the main lake indicative of turbidity currents off Lillooet delta
   which infilled and flattened the underlying surface. A sill which
   separates the main and south basins prevents the down-lake progression
   of turbidity currents resulting in conformable deposits indicative of
   rain-out (i.e. settling) processes only. A major acoustic reflector at
   about 6-9 m below the modern sediment surface is associated with a
   well-dated volcanic eruption and sediment yield event in the upper basin
   at 2400 years BP. Modem glaciolacustrine deposition forms varves which
   accumulate at a rate of up to 28 mm year-1 in the north and decline to
   less than 0.9 mm year-1 in the south. The occurrence of two
   sediment-runoff regimes, one average and the other extreme leads to
   distinct differences in varve sedimentology and varve thickness.
   De-coupling the two signals using sedimentary evidence alone cannot be
   done consistently so a sediment yield-runoff relation for the lake (r2 =
   41\%) contains considerable `noise'. An annual sediment accumulation
   chronology covering the last 125 years shows a much higher frequency of
   `extreme' runoff-sediment yield events during the post-1940 interval.
   This parallels a documented change in climate of the region after 1945
   and suggests that a longer varve chronology would provide a good,
   high-resolution, proxy record of hydroclimatic variations.}},

Abstract = {{Lake studies allow contemporary sediment and nutrient dynamics to be
   placed in a historical context in order that trends and rates of change
   in catchment inputs may be calculated. Here, a synthesis of the temporal
   information contained in catchment and lake sediment records is
   attempted. A chemical fractionation technique is used to isolate the
   different sediment sources contained in the lake core, and Pb-210 dates
   provide an accurate record of changes in lake sediment sources over the
   past 100 years. The extent to which land-use records, collated from
   agricultural census returns, and process-based studies of sediment and
   nutrient export from different catchment land uses can be used to
   explain the trends observed in the lake sediments is examined. Sediment
   influx to the study lake has increased from less than 2 mm year-1 prior
   to the Second World War to over 10 mm year-1 at present. The source of
   the sediment is largely unaltered and unweathered allochthonous material
   eroded from the catchment. Land-use records suggest that the
   intensification of agriculture, characterized by a shift towards arable
   land immediately postwar, followed by an increase in the area of
   temporary grass in the 1960s, may be the cause of accelerated catchment
   erosion; both land-use changes would have increased the area of ploughed
   land in the catchment. An increase in the number of cattle and sheep in
   the catchment from around 2000 and 6000, respectively, in the 1940s, to
   a peak of nearly 7000 cattle and over 15 000 sheep in the 1980s,
   provides a further source of sediment and nutrients. livestock are
   grazed on permanent grassland which is commonly located on steep
   hillslopes and in riparian zones where saturation-excess surface runoff
   may be an important hydrological pathway. Rainfall simulation
   experiments show that surface runoff from heavily grazed grassland has a
   high suspended sediment, ammonium-nitrogen and particulate phosphorus
   load. The combined effect of the long-term increase in the organic
   loading from livestock and the inorganic N and P load from fertilizers,
   may be the source of nutrient enrichment in the lake.}},

Abstract = {{Flood frequency curves are presented for five regions in the western USA
   characterized by diverse climate but similar physiography. The regional
   curves are obtained via an index flood method based on
   probability-weighted moments of the generalized extreme value
   distribution. The curves differ markedly in their slopes, reflecting
   differences in mechanisms that produce floods. The Foothills region of
   Colorado is typical of semi-arid areas where floods are produced by
   intense thunderstorms. In this region, the 100-year flood may be more
   than ten times the mean annual flood. The Alpine region of Colorado is
   typical of areas where runoff is generated by snowmelt. In this region,
   the 100-year flood is less than two times the mean annual flood. The
   Sierra Nevada, Coast Range and Klamath Mountain regions of California
   typify areas where floods are produced by large-scale frontal storms. In
   these regions, the 100-year flood may be three to six times the mean
   annual flood. In all regions the mean annual flood is most highly
   correlated with drainage area and mean annual precipitation. No
   correlation is found between the standard deviation of annual maxima and
   various measures of basin physiography or drainage area. It is suggested
   that the variation in flood frequency distributions reflects largely the
   variability in precipitation amount and intensity rather than
   differences in physiography.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrological models are generally unable to simulate correctly water
   exchanges at the soil-atmosphere interface and the time evolution of
   surface soil humidity. This drawback often leads to poor simulation of
   water flows after periods of low flows because of the wrong estimation
   of the surface soil water content. In this paper, we describe how remote
   sensing can be used to account for the vegetation in the estimation of
   the actual evapotranspiration, and to estimate soil moisture regularly
   throughout the year and use it to correct the model simulation. This
   work has been done on the Adour river basin, in the framework of the
   HAPEX-MOBILHY experiment. The results presented show the improvements
   that result from the use of remote sensing data in hydrological
   modelling: better simulation of the soil moisture and of water flows at
   the outlets, and more realistic calculation of evaporation.}},

Abstract = {{The difficulties involved in calibrating conceptual watershed models
   have, in the past, been partly attributable to the lack of robust
   optimization tools. Recently, a global optimization method known as the
   SCE-UA (shuffled complex evolution method developed at The University of
   Arizona) has shown promise as an effective and efficient optimization
   technique for calibrating watershed models. Experience with the method
   has indicated that the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm are
   influenced by the choice of the algorithmic parameters. This paper first
   reviews the essential concepts of the SCE-UA method and then presents
   the results of several experimental studies in which the National
   Weather Service river forecast system-soil moisture accounting
   (NWSRFS-SMA) model, used by the National Weather Service for river and
   flood forecasting, was calibrated using different algorithmic parameter
   setups. On the basis of these results, the recommended values for the
   algorithmic parameters are given. These values should also help to
   provide guidelines for other users of the SCE-UA method.}},

Abstract = {{Previous investigations have shown that an estimate of the catchment
   response to a storm event can be obtained from a consideration of
   kinematic waves flowing over planar surfaces. For a singular plane,
   analytical solutions have been presented previously for storm events
   with a constant intensity of rainfall excess. However, these solutions
   have limited applicability owing to the non-uniform distribution of
   precipitation and, hence, rainfall excess in most real storm events.
   Analytical and numerical solutions for a number of non-uniform patterns
   of rainfall excess are presented. Solutions obtained show that the
   pattern of rainfall excess has a considerable influence on the catchment
   response. This influence is evident in the different time-to-peak of the
   resultant runoff hydrographs and in the hydrograph shape itself.
   Therefore, the time of concentration is not a constant characteristic of
   the catchment which can be determined without consideration of the
   temporal pattern of rainfall excess. Finally, the predicted hydrographs
   obtained for variable rates of rainfall excess have higher peak flow
   rates than that obtained for a constant intensity of rainfall excess.}},

Title = {{THE EFFECT OF SOLUTE SIZE ON DIFFUSIVE DISPERSIVE TRANSPORT IN
   POROUS-MEDIA}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of solute size on
   diffusive-dispersive transport in porous media. Miscible displacement
   experiments were performed with tracers of various sizes (i.e. tritiated
   water (H2O)-H-3, pentafluorobenzoate (PFBA), and
   2,4-dichloro-phenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)) and a homogeneous, nonreactive
   sand for pore-water velocities varying by three orders of magnitude (70,
   7, 0.66, and 0.06 cm h- 1). Hydrodynamic dispersion is the predominant
   source of dispersion for higher pore-water velocities (exceeding 1 cm
   h-1), and dispersivity is, therefore, essentially independent of solute
   size. In this case, the practice of using a small-sized tracer, such as
   (H2O)-H-3, to characterize the dispersive properties of a soil is valid.
   The contribution of axial diffusion becomes significant at pore-water
   velocities lower than 0.1 cm h-1. At a given velocity below this value,
   the contribution of axial diffusion is larger for (H2O)-H-3, with its
   larger coefficient of molecular diffusion, than it-is for PFBA and
   2,4-D. The apparent dispersivities are, therefore, a function of solute
   size. The use of a tracer-derived dispersivity for solutes of different
   sizes would not be valid in this caw. For systems where diffusion is
   important, compounds such as PFBA are the preferred tracers for
   representing advective-dispersive transport of many organic contaminants
   of interest.}},

Abstract = {{In geostatistical estimation, a model developed to describe the
   structure of the spatial function must be tested against field data to
   check its validity. Orthonormal residuals as a diagnostic tool have
   advantages over conventional standardized residuals in that they are
   easy to calculate and the determination of the sampling distributions of
   statistics based on them is computationally efficient. In this paper,
   the applicability of a normality test known as the Filliben test is
   studied which checks the hypothesis that orthonormal residuals have a
   normal distribution when the model is consistent with the available
   data. For a set of hydraulic head measurements, two different models of
   the structure of the head field were tested. Result indicated that the
   Filliben test agrees with other validation tests and thus can be used
   for diagnosing model adequacy.}},

Abstract = {{The rill structure over the soil surface plays an important role in
   determining the runoff and sediment loss from hillslopes. The
   microtopography is often complicated, and representation of the
   hillslope surface on a rill-by-rill basis is uneconomical and
   impractical. A spectral approach combined with a stochastic theory is
   proposed for the rill profile. The theory develops appropriate
   probability distribution laws for rill amplitudes and rill periods
   (interrill areas) under the assumption that the spectrum of the rill
   profile is narrow banded. This study establishes a foundation for future
   studies dealing with parameter estimation, and determining the global
   roughness and erodibility for runoff and sediment discharge predictions
   over hillslopes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with examining the bandwidth of the spectral density
   functions of rill profiles from transect measurements at three
   cross-slope locations over decomposed granite hillslopes in Northern
   California. Parameter estimation for the probabilistic description of
   rill heights under the narrow-banded spectrum assumption was then
   considered. The theoretical predictions of the rill structure agree
   fairly well with-the corresponding observed results. Estimation of
   extreme-valued rills and significant rill heights is addressed to
   quantify the severity of the rilled hillslope surface. It is concluded
   that the spectral approach is a valid method for quantifying the rill
   structure for use in physical models of water flow and sediment
   transport over rilled hillslope surfaces.}},

   detection of the effect of groundwater rising from the water table and,
   to a lesser extent, that of hot springs. These conditions rendered the
   modelisation of the system complex. The use of stochastic models to
   reconstitute a new series statistically alike to the historic series was
   successful. The statistical characteristics of the new series are

Abstract = {{Four deterministic rainfall-runoff models are briefly described and
   applied to a small (0.18 km2) grassland catchment in the Eastern Cape
   Province of South Africa. The models vary in complexity, from a variable
   time step model with two soil layers and incorporating probability
   distribution principles for some of the parameters, through two daily
   time step models, to a relatively simple, but widely used, monthly time
   step model. The model parameters have largely been determined from
   measured physical characteristics (topography, soils, vegetation, etc.)
   of the catchment and not through calibration. As well as comparing the
   simulated runoff values, the model performances are compared using
   observed values of soil moisture measured over a period of some 29
   months. Although the four models produce similar results, the variable
   time step model simulates the observed soil moisture variation most
   successfully and the monthly model least successfully. Most of the
   differences in the simulation results can be explained by either the
   differences in complexity of the modelling approach or the resolution of
   the input data.}},

Abstract = {{Rainfall rates estimated from polarimetric weather radar measurements of
   a convective rainstorm are used as input to a two-dimensional physically
   based rainfall-runoff model. The correlation length of the input
   rainfall field L(S) is 2.3 km. Runoff simulations are performed on two
   semi-arid watersheds covering 32 km2 and 121 km2 at basin data grid
   sizes L(M) of 125 m and 200 m, respectively. The characteristic basin
   length scale L(W) is taken as the square root of the watershed area.
   Rainfall data at resolutions L(R) of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 km serve as
   model input to determine the effect of precipitation data spatial
   resolution on computed outflow hydrographs. Two dimensionless length
   parameters are identified which describe the similarity of the effect of
   rainfall data aggregation on both basins. The first parameter,
   L(R)/L(S), describes `storm smearing', and the second parameter,
   L(R)/L(W), describes `watershed smearing'. Results from simulations
   without infiltration show storm smearing occurring as L(R) --> L(S).
   Watershed smearing causes more significant deviations from simulations
   using the finest-resolution data when L(R)/L(W) exceeds 0.4. Results
   with infiltration reveal that excess rainfall volumes decrease with
   increasing L(R)/L(W). Additionally, excess rainfall volumes do not
   converge as L(R)/L(W) is decreased to the practical lower limit provided
   by contemporary weather radars, which is of the order of 1 km.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{158}},
Number = {{1-2}},

Abstract = {{A model is developed specifically for simulating the nitrate
   concentrations in a stream at approximately weekly intervals in an
   upland forested and a moorland catchment. It is constructed on the basis
   of observed nitrate concentrations in rain water and in two streams, the
   Hafren and the Hore, at Plynlimon, Mid-Wales, where long data records
   exist. The Hore catchment has recently undergone extensive
   deforestation.
   A simple regression model relating temperature to stream nitrate
   concentrations was capable of simulating the seasonal fluctuations in
   nitrate concentration observed in the Hafren. However, this ignores the
   influx of nitrate through wet deposition and is incapable of simulating
   land-use change. The regression model was developed into a simple
   dynamic model which includes a deposition term and a biomass indicator.
   The extended Kalman filter algorithm was used to estimate the optimum
   values of the parameters and to assess the model structure. The model
   was applied to both catchments, and the fit between observed and
   simulated nitrate concentrations at the Hafren was good. At the Hore,
   the model was able to capture the major changes in nitrate concentration
   through the deforestation and replanting phases although detailed
   short-term dynamics were not well represented. Finally, the model is
   related, speculatively, to processes which are known to occur in most
   catchments. This simple model is intended as a step towards the
   development of similar but more comprehensive catchment models of stream
   nitrogen dynamics.}},

   nowcasting system is described. In particular, an option to advect the
   precipitation field with forecast winds has been introduced. Routine
   evaluations indicate a consistent improvement in forecast accuracy,
   relative to persistence, following the upgrade. Forecast accumulations
   are evaluated by comparison with raingauge data in two regions of the
   UK. In the North West, they are compared with heavy rainfall warnings
   issued operationally. The operational forecasts were significant
   overestimates (average bias +250\%) but were issued more reliably than
   were the FRONTIERS forecasts, which were much closer to ground truth for
   the same cases (average bias -29\%). Comparison with a dense gauge
   network in the South East shows that the accuracy of the forecasts
   increases with increasing accumulation period and catchment size.}},

Abstract = {{The results of a study of spatial variations in throughfall chemistry
   are presented for a small plot located within a beech forest in southern
   England. Throughfall data were collected from three late-autumn storms
   using an array of 48 fixed-position collectors. For each of these
   storms, there were large variations in collection volume and in major
   and minor chemical determinands. Most chemical determinands had a strong
   positive correlation with one another and a slight negative correlation
   with volume. Strong correlations were observed even for chemicals which
   are associated with different processes; e.g. K and Mn derive from
   leaching, but were correlated with marine-derived Na and Cl inputs. In
   other words, locations with high occult or dry deposition inputs had a
   correspondingly high contribution from leaching. This means that great
   care is required in field experimentation if canopy processes are to be
   described accurately: high correlation between chemicals indicates that
   the different supply mechanisms are not independent. The spatial
   distribution of throughfall volume and chemistry showed consistent
   storm-to-storm patterns: there was a localized systematic location
   effect. Ratios between different chemical species in throughfall were
   consistent from point to point, whereas concentrations and fluxes were
   very variable. The practices of random relocation, of collecting
   multiple samples and of bulking before chemical analysis are strongly
   recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed groundwater monitoring below a sandy forested recharge area in
   south-central Canada shows that atmospherically derived SO42-, occurring
   at concentrations of 6-27 mg l-1 in the shallow aquifer, is completely
   consumed within a zone of less than 6 m thickness encountered at about
   15 m depth. The SO42- depletion zone is anoxic, which suggests that
   biogenic sulphate reduction is the principal SO42--depleting process.
   The field evidence suggests that, in this environment, the reduction
   reaction is similar to a first-order decay process with a relatively
   short half-life of about 3 years. Isotopic fractionation of SO42--S is
   observed during the reaction and can be described by a Rayleigh-type
   distillation process governed by an enrichment factor averaging -15.5
   parts per thousand.}},

Abstract = {{A method for flood routing in rigid bed channels using multilinear
   modelling based on a time distribution scheme is presented. The discrete
   cascade model with its parameters related to channel and flow
   characteristics through a moment-matching technique is used as the
   linear submodel. The particular advantage of using this two-parameter
   submodel is that it simulates the outflow hydrograph in a realistic way
   unlike the Muskingum model which produces a `dip' or `reduced outflow'
   at the beginning of routing. The suitability of this method for routing
   floods in uniform rectangular channels is studied by routing a
   mathematically defined inflow hydrograph. The solutions obtained using
   this model are compared with the corresponding solutions of the St.
   Venant equations. The study reveals that the proposed multilinear model
   reproduces the St. Venant solutions closely when the rating curve
   corresponding to the inflow hydrograph is characterized by a narrow
   loop.}},

Abstract = {{With the exception of water-bearing remnants of earlier fluvial gravels
   overlying basement, the sediments of the Poverty Bay flats have
   accumulated during the postglacial period of the past 14 000 years, and
   have been tilted and deformed by recent tectonism. A sequence of gravel
   aquifers, separated by poorly permeable silt layers, lies between
   surface and basement, which is at depths varying between 50 and 200 m. A
   shallow sand/silt aquifer is situated near the coast. This study applies
   evidence of chemical and isotopic properties of river and ground water
   to clarify the recharge mechanisms, chemical evolution and age of the
   ground water in the aquifers. Particular attention is paid to the
   evolution of dissolved inorganic carbon content, applying carbon-14 data
   measured by accelerator mass spectrometry. Most of the ground water is
   recharged from the Waipaoa River, which flows across the flats and
   discharges into Poverty Bay. The two deepest aquifers (Matokitoki and
   Makauri) are both tritium-free; the deeper Matokitoki Gravels yield
   water of age about 4300 years since recharge (possibly up to 1300 years
   greater), but the Makauri water is no older than 100-200 years,
   discharging slowly through overlying aquitards near the limit of closest
   approach to the present coast.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach is used for the determination of the theoretical
   distribution of low flows in a highly developed basin. As estimates of
   water diversions and return flows from irrigation may have high errors,
   difficulties arise in transforming an observed series of river flows to
   a natural series, which is a prior requirement in a statistical analysis
   of this type.  A priori reasoning suggests that the net diversions may
   be represented by linear, non-linear or truncated functions of river
   flows. A two-component log-normal distribution is proposed, in which the
   first component represents the natural low flows in the basin,
   unaffected by irrigation, and the second component models the effects of
   diversions, return flows and other regulations. The adopted diversion
   rule provides the link between the components. The maximum likelihood
   method is applied for parameter estimation, but simplified procedures
   based on the method of moments are investigated, and one which results
   in a sufficiently good fit is obtained. The feasibility of relating the
   constants of the net diversion rules to physical parameters such as
   catchment area is investigated. The method is applied to the Po basin,
   the largest in Italy.}},

Abstract = {{It has been thought that the two main processes responsible for river
   bank retreat are the removal of particles or layers of material by flow
   erosion or sloughing and collapse by slumping. A third process,
   involving the development of a subsurface cavity after washout of
   gravels which is succeeded by slow subsidence of a segment of the former
   channel bank, has been identified at a site in the New Forest, southern
   England. The process was monitored over a 9 month period, and was
   observed to be assisted by the hydrological effects of a dam of coarse
   woody debris across the channel. As these dams occur frequently, the
   process is likely to have occurred elsewhere along channels in forested
   areas.}},

Abstract = {{Given a time series of daily rainfall totals, it is recognized that the
   maximum daily value is, in general, lower than the true 24 h maximum.
   Thus, annual maximum series under-represent the extreme events, and
   correction factors are therefore required to convert them to their 24 h
   counterparts. The phenomenon is generalized and examined by reference to
   UK time series for rainfall, wind speed and air temperature, resulting
   in mean correction factors of 1.167, 1.099 and 1.036, respectively. For
   air temperature, the result is influenced by the choice of datum. In
   general, such correction factors are unavailable, and so the effective
   fractal dimension, d, of the data is investigated as a means through
   which to predict them; the correlation found is promising.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Volume = {{157}},

Abstract = {{Acidic drainage from the oxidation of mine tailing wastes is an
   important environmental problem. The purpose of this paper is to develop
   a model (1) to simulate the rate of oxidation of pyrite over time, (2)
   to verify the importance of chemical kinetic control and diffusion
   control on the oxidation rate with time and, (3) to evaluate the
   sensitivity of the model to critical parameters of the tailings, such as
   grain size, pyrite content and the effective diffusion coefficient. The
   source code comprises four main modules including parameter allocation
   (kinetics, transport), sulphide oxidation (shrinking particle), oxygen
   transport and pyrite mass balance. The results show that high oxidation
   rates are observed in the initial time after tailings deposition. During
   this initial period of high rates, an apparent shift occurs from kinetic
   to diffusional control over a period of time that depends on the
   composition and properties of the tailings. Based on the simulation
   results, it is evident that the overall rate of oxidation after a few
   years will be controlled dominantly by the diffusion of oxygen rather
   than by biological or non-biological kinetics in the tailings.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces the general outline of CELMOD5, a parametric,
   semi-distributed, quasi-linear model, for conversion of rainfall into
   surface runoff. The model considers the watershed as a series of
   interconnected cell units, each representing a specific portion of the
   area of the watershed. In contrast to grid models using a large number
   of rectangular elements or cells, the number of cells in CELMOD is
   relatively small and their boundaries are chosen according to the
   watershed topography. For each cell, the program computes the surface
   runoff hydrograph at the cell outlet, related to a specified record of
   total rainfall data at a number of rain gages. If measured surface
   runoff data are available for some locations in the watersheds, the
   program can compare these data with computed values of surface runoff at
   the corresponding points of the cell model. Detailed descriptions are
   provided for the main model procedures - computation of rainfall excess,
   conversion of rainfall excess into surface outflow, routing the channel
   inflow and subtraction of channel losses. Special attention is given in
   this model to the specific conditions of arid or semi-arid watersheds.
   This paper is also concerned with a technique for calibrating and
   testing a forecasting model of storm hydrographs with emphasis on two
   objective functions - runoff volume and peak discharge. A method for
   evaluation procedure is presented based on the following five steps:
   trial and error calibration; sensitivity analysis; bilinear
   interpolation optimization; testing the model on different storm events;
   testing the model on a different watershed. Results are presented for
   all the larger storm events with reliable data during 12 years in two
   sub-watersheds of the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in
   southeastern Arizona. The evaluation procedure is demonstrated for one
   particular rainfall-runoff event.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, two distributed parameter, physically based, kinematic
   wave hydrologic models, HEC-1 and KINEROS, were tested on a 30.4 ha
   watershed located near Treynor, Iowa. The study had two objectives: (1)
   to determine the ability of the models to predict runoff with very
   limited calibration; (2) to determine how accurately the models can
   simulate runoff given accurate model parameters. The results show that
   HEC-1 can achieve good prediction of runoff with very limited
   calibration. It was not, however, possible to achieve the same level of
   prediction with the KINEROS model. Given good calibration, both models
   can simulate the rainfall-runoff process with great accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Time series analysis of the fluctuations in shallow groundwater levels
   in the Netherlands lowlands have revealed a large-scale decline in head
   during recent decades as a result of an increase in land drainage and
   groundwater withdrawal. The situation is more ambiguous in large
   groundwater bodies located in the eastern part of the country, where the
   unsaturated zone increases from near zero along the edges to about 40 m
   in the centre of the area. As depth of the unsaturated zone increases,
   groundwater level reacts with an increasing delay to fluctuations in
   climate and influences of human activities. The aim of the present paper
   is to model groundwater level fluctuations in these areas using a linear
   stochastic transfer function model, relating groundwater levels to
   estimated precipitation excess, and to separate artificial components
   from the natural groundwater regime. In this way, the impact of
   groundwater withdrawal and the reclamation of a 1000 km2 polder area on
   the groundwater levels in the adjoining higher ground could be assessed.
   It became evident that the linearity assumption of the transfer
   functions becomes a serious drawback in areas with the deepest
   groundwater levels, because of non-linear processes in the deep
   unsaturated zone and the non-synchronous arrival of recharge in the
   saturated zone. Comparison of the results from modelling the influence
   of reclamation with an analytical solution showed that the lowering of
   groundwater level is partly compensated by reduced discharge and
   therefore is less than expected.}},

   accumulation of Cd and I is observed. Pb is lost from two catchments
   with bedrock rich in lead-zinc-CaCO3 mineralisation and is accumulated
   in the other catchment. The monthly variations in flux illustrate the
   importance of climatic variations: for most of the elements, except Al,

   than heavy rainfall. The felling of the forest in one catchment resulted
   in increased element losses, especially of NO3, K, Mn, B and Cd.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, winter mean 700 mbar height anomalies over the eastern
   North Pacific Ocean and the western USA are related to variability in
   snowpack accumulations measured on or about 1 April at 21 snowcourse
   stations within and near the Gunnison River basin in Colorado. Results
   indicate that lower than normal snowpack accumulations are primarily
   associated with positive 700 mbar height anomalies (anomalous
   anticyclonic circulation) over the western USA. Moist air from the
   Pacific Ocean is moved to the north of the western USA along the western
   margin of the anomalous anticyclonic circulation. In contrast, higher
   than normal snowpack accumulations are associated with negative 700 mbar
   height anomalies (anomalous cyclonic circulation) over the western USA
   and over most of the eastern North Pacific Ocean. The anomalous cyclonic
   circulation over the western USA enhances the movement of moisture from
   the Pacific Ocean into the southern and central parts of the West.
   Results also indicate that variability in winter mean 700 mbar height
   anomalies can explain over 50\% of the variability in snowpack
   accumulations in the Gunnison River basin. The significant linear
   relationships between 700 mbar height anomalies and snowpack
   accumulations in the Gunnison River basin can be used in conjunction
   with general circulation model simulations of 700 mbar height anomalies
   for future climatic conditions to estimate future snowpack accumulations
   in the Gunnison River basin.}},

   poor performance in reproducing the extreme values of the depth
   distribution. The first of these problems is here addressed by
   superposition of a jitter process on the rectangular pulse, thus
   providing a more realistic representation of the continuous time
   process. Applying the jitter to each rainfall cell appears more
   effective than applying it to the instantaneous rainfall depth and
   enables a more satisfactory reproduction of the autocorrelations. The
   use of a gamma variable to replace the exponential distribution of the
   cell intensity provides a good reproduction of the extreme rainfall
   depths at different time-scales. Moreover, the values of the parameters
   providing an optimal reproduction of the extreme values of the depth
   distribution are in most cases close to those obtained by optimizing on
   the interevent time features, which provides a method for estimation and
   ensures that the two objectives do not conflict.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to quantify and analyse the evaporation
   during night-time in a willow (Salix viminalis L.) short-rotation stand.
   Evaporation measurements were made throughout the 24 h period on 76 days
   during the 1988 growing season using the energy-balance/Bowen-ratio
   method. Canopy conductance was estimated using a rearranged form of the
   Penman combination equation. The mean hourly evaporation rate during
   daytime was 0.18 mm h-1 and the corresponding value during night-time
   was 0.013 mm h-1, about 7\% of the daytime rate. The mean cumulative
   night-time evaporation was 0.12 mm per night or 4.3\% of the mean
   daytime evaporation. The highest night-time evaporation occurred in
   September and October with 0.21 mm and 0.36 mm per night, respectively,
   some 30-35\% of the daytime evaporation during these periods. Total
   night-time evaporation for the growing season was estimated as 21 mm.
   Night-time evaporation was controlled mainly by vapour pressure deficit
   and ventilation whereas net radiation had only a minor influence. The
   night-time canopy resistance was estimated for a shorter period when the
   canopy was completely closed (leaf area index around 5) and the soil
   evaporation could be assumed negligible. The canopy resistance ranged
   between 10 and 220 s m-1 depending on vapour pressure deficit. The
   dependence on vapour pressure deficit during night-time was similar to
   the dependence during daytime but with a much larger sensitivity during
   the dark period.}},

   for the covariances and cross-covariances between the random head,

   covariances and cross-covariances can be incorporated into a Bayesian
   conditioning procedure which provides optimal estimates of the recharge,
   transmissivity and head fields given available measurements of any or

   valuable information for estimating the random recharge field. However,
   when recharge is treated as a spatially variable random field, the value
   of head measurements for estimating the transmissivity field can be
   reduced considerably. In a companion paper, the method is applied to a

Abstract = {{The first-order analytical solution of the inverse problem for
   estimating spatially variable recharge and transmissivity under
   steady-state groundwater flow, developed in Part 1 is applied to the
   Upper Floridan Aquifer in NE Florida. Parameters characterizing the
   statistical structure of the log-transmissivity and head fields are
   estimated from 152 measurements of transmissivity and 146 measurements
   of hydraulic head available in the study region. Optimal estimates of
   the recharge, transmissivity and head fields are produced throughout the
   study region by conditioning on the nearest 10 available transmissivity
   measurements and the nearest 10 available head measurements. Head
   observations are shown to provide valuable information for estimating
   both the transmissivity and the recharge fields. Accurate numerical
   groundwater model predictions of the aquifer flow system are obtained
   using the optimal transmissivity and recharge fields as input
   parameters, and the optimal head field to define boundary conditions.
   For this case study, both the transmissivity field and the uncertainty
   of the transmissivity field prediction are poorly estimated, when the
   effects of random recharge are neglected.}},

Abstract = {{The methods used to calculate both the Revised Universal Soil Loss
   Equation (RUSLE) erosivity factor (R) and the 10 year frequency storm
   erosion index value (EI10) are presented. As the calculation methods
   require long-term rainfall intensity data, and such data are not
   available for all application sites, an approach used to estimate the
   R-factor is described. Examples illustrating applications of the
   estimation technique in Africa, Asia, and other parts of the world are
   summarized. The method, which establishes correlations between measured
   R-values and more readily available precipitation data, is used to
   develop relations for estimating R-values in the USA. Correlations based
   on average monthly precipitation data and the R-factor values for 155 US
   stations were initially used to develop estimation relations. The 155
   stations were segregated based on the annual distribution of monthly
   precipitation and the correlations improved. Exclusion of 23 stations
   with both `winter-type' precipitation distributions and modified Fourier
   index values greater than 100 mm improved the relations for the
   remaining 132 stations (r2 = 0.81). An estimation relation for the EI10
   is also presented. The R-factor and EI10 estimation relations should
   facilitate the use of RUSLE for locations with only monthly
   precipitation data.}},

Abstract = {{One of six wells drilled into the crystalline rock of the Black Forest

   survey has been used to detect hydraulically active fractures and to
   identify their character by a variety of logging tools such as caliper
   and televiewer logging, vertical seismic profiling (VSP) and electrical
   and thermal measurements in addition to standard logging recordings. In
   the 265 m Moosengrund well drilled into the Triberg granite body these
   methods were applied successfully to discriminate between fractures and
   breakouts and to identify open and closed fractures and water-consuming
   or water-expelling fractures, respectively. Fracture strike, dip and
   width were determined from televiewer data. VSP measurements were used
   to determine the seismic velocities in the unfractured rock and the
   fracture zones. Estimates of permeability (10-55 Darcy) and
   transmissivity (0.1-1.0 cm2 s-1) of the fracture zones were obtained by
   the analysis of P waves and tube waves in the VSP records. The summed
   values of the transmissivity yield an upper estimate of the overall
   transmissivity determined by a pumping test.}},

Abstract = {{Boussinesq's equation is frequently employed to study the influence of
   flood-stage hydrographs in streams on bank storage effects. This
   equation is nonlinear and no analytical solutions are available for
   arbitrarily shaped stage hydrographs. Analytical solutions are presented
   for the linearized form of the equation, and expressions for the flow
   rate from the stream to the aquifer are developed. Results indicate that
   these analytical solutions may not be very accurate (as much as 10\%
   error) when compared with numerical solution of the nonlinear equation.
   These deterministic analytical solutions lead to analytical expressions
   for the mean and variance of flux rates when the hydraulic properties of
   the aquifer are treated as random quantities. Monte-Carlo simulation
   results show that linearized analytical solutions are potentially useful
   for predicting mean flux rates when aquifer properties exhibit a large

Abstract = {{Petrographic methods are used to examine the nature of the Floridan
   post-Oligocene unconformity and diagenetic responses in the associated

   Suwannee Limestone dolomites and basal Hawthorn Group dolosilts. The
   purpose of the study is to determine if the original texture of geologic
   materials is preserved more frequently in rocks deposited in a
   supratidal environment in the uppermost Floridan carbonates, to examine
   possible sources of magnesium for the dolomitization that has occurred
   in the Floridan aquifer, and to determine the chemical environment of
   dolomite formation. On the basis of lithology, the tri-county study area
   can be divided into two regions; one in which the uppermost Floridan
   carbonate is calcareous or locally silicified, and one in which the
   aquifer system is capped with dolomite. Lateral interfingering between
   the two regions is apparent, and it is inferred that the boundary
   between the limestone and dolomite represents a geochemical boundary
   between a mixed marine and freshwater environment and a subaerially
   exposed freshwater environment. Where dolomite has replaced the
   uppermost Suwannee Limestone, the dolomite is overlain by a thin unit of
   dolosilt. The predominant source of magnesium for the dolomitization
   that occurred in the study area is probably seawater.}},

Abstract = {{Information on the water-use efficiency (WUE) of a vegetation cover
   improves understanding of the interrelationship between the water and
   carbon cycles, and enables hydrological practices to be related to
   agricultural and silvicultural planning and management. This study
   determined seasonal and climatic variations of the WUE of a fertilized
   and irrigated short-rotation stand of Salix viminalis L. on a clay soil.
   The WUE was determined as the ratio of above-ground production to
   transpiration or, alternatively, to transpiration divided by the
   saturation vapour pressure deficit. Growth was estimated from a
   combination of destructive and non-destructive measurements for 10 day
   periods during the growing seasons of 1986 and 1988. Daily transpiration
   was estimated using a physically based evaporation model, tuned against
   energy-balance/Bowen-ratio measurements of total stand evaporation.
   Nutrients were adequate and climate conditions were similar in both
   years. In spite of irrigation soil-water deficits developed during
   midsummer and affected growth rates in different ways: in 1986, both
   stem and leaf growth decreased, while in 1988 only stem growth
   decreased. Exceptionally high stem growth rates, twice the total
   potential growth rates, were recorded after the drought of 1988. They
   were probably caused by root-allocated assimilates that were sent
   above-ground after the drought. In both years, stem growth ceased 2-3
   weeks after the leaf area had reached its maximum. Since light and
   temperature were still sufficient to maintain assimilation, all growth
   presumably took place below ground towards the end of the season.
   Changes in root-shoot allocation caused large variations in the WUE in
   1988. The WUE, weighted by the saturation vapour pressure deficit, was
   fairly constant in 1986. In both years, the WUE was correlated with the
   vapour pressure deficit. Towards the end of both growing seasons, when
   all assimilates were sent below ground, the WUE decreased rapidly to
   zero. The total WUE, estimated as the seasonally accumulated
   above-ground production divided by accumulated transpiration, was 4.1 g
   kg-1 in 1986 and 5.5 g kg-1 in 1988, which is relatively high in
   comparison with other species.}},

Abstract = {{A physically based soil water model was applied to a fertilized and
   irrigated short-rotation willow stand on a clay soil. The model is based
   on an extension of Richards' equation, and the water retention curve and
   saturated conductivity are determined by analyses of soil cores. The
   Penman-Monteith combination equation is used to calculate potential
   daily transpiration, soil evaporation and potential interception
   evaporation. Daily meteorological data are used as driving variables.
   Evaporation, estimated by the energy balance/Bowen ratio method, and
   soil-water tension measurements made over several years, were used to
   verify the model. Measured evaporation of water intercepted by the
   vegetation over 1 year was also compared with simulated monthly values.
   Good agreement was found between simulated evaporation and evaporation
   determined from Bowen ratio measurements. The cumulative seasonal
   evaporation exceeded the Penman open water evaporation by up to 31\% in
   3 years out of 4; it ranged between 416 and 584 mm for the period from
   May through October. On a mean seasonal basis, transpiration was 66\%,
   soil evaporation 23\% and interception evaporation 11\% of total
   evaporation. The monthly interception evaporation comprised 5-23\% of
   precipitation. The study period showed interannual variations
   attributable to variation in climate (including irrigation) as well as
   to stand age and development. This indicates that the model is quite
   general in many respects; it is tentatively suggested that it be used
   for accurate simulation of water balance components of short-rotation
   forest on a clay soil in this type of climate.}},

Abstract = {{Thirteen interstitial water chloride profiles have been obtained from
   the unsaturated zone of the coastal Quaternary aquifer in Senegal over
   depth intervals ranging between 7.0 and 35.5 m; three of these profiles
   reached the water table. A regional study of 119 dug wells was also
   carried out over an area of some 1600 km2 for the measurement of
   chloride, as well as other parameters, in samples taken from the water
   table.
   These two sets of data have been used, together with rainfall input
   chemistry collected over a 3 year interval to derive regional estimates
   of recharge for this area typical of the Sahel margin (mean annual
   rainfall 1970-1990 around 280 mm). Recharge estimates range from 13000
   to 1100 m3 kM-2 year-1. It is concluded that the conjunctive use of
   interstitial water profiles and regional shallow groundwater chemistry
   provide an inexpensive technique for recharge estimation which can be
   widely applied in sedimentary terrains.}},

Abstract = {{Leaching of agricultural chemicals from the root and vadose zones into
   groundwater is an important environmental concern. To procure a better
   understanding of the movement and transport of agricultural chemicals
   through the soil profile, a field research study was conducted to
   estimate bromide leaching losses under saturated conditions where
   preferential flow is occurring. The field data were then used to
   evaluate the LEACHM model. Eighteen double-ring infiltrometers were used
   to apply a pulse (100 mm depth) of bromide tracer on two previously
   saturated soils located in a karst region of southeastern Pennsylvania.
   Internal drainage over the next seven days resulted in nearly 51 \% of
   the applied Br- being leached to a depth below 0.80 m. The LEACHM model
   was used to simulate the amount of bromide leached in each
   infiltrometer. The model predicted, accurately, an average of 46\% of
   the applied Br- leached below the 0.80 m depth. Mcan values of bromide
   concentration in the soil profile were predicted within two standard
   deviations of the measured mean for all depths except for the 0.20-0.40
   m depth increment where the model overpredicted the bromide
   concentration. The model predictions of Br- leached were tested against
   field measurements using several statistical tests. The LEACHM model
   performed adequately under preferential flow conditions, perhaps because
   the infiltration rate at each site was used as a model input. This,
   actually, is some measure of the macropore flow process and suggests
   that simple models such as LEACHM can be used in the field, as long as a
   distribution of infiltration rates is used as an input.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in runoff water quality were investigated at the Panola
   Mountain Research Watershed (PMRW), a 41 ha forested catchment in the
   Georgia Piedmont, from October 1985 to September 1988, to evaluate
   processes controlling solute transport. Routine weekly manual sampling
   was augmented by sampling during storms using a computer-controlled
   automatic water-quality sampler. Runoff from a 3 ha bedrock outcrop in
   the headwaters typically had high solute concentrations at the onset of
   a rainstorm. The SO42- and H+ concentrations were higher in runoff from
   this outcrop than in the corresponding rain. These high concentrations
   were attributed to the wash-off of acidic-SO42- dry deposition that had
   accumulated on the outcrop during the preceding dry period. In contrast,
   both NH4+ and NO3- were depleted in the runoff, probably because they
   were removed by the lichens and mosses covering the outcrop.
   Storm sampling of streamwater at the basin outlet indicated that NO3-
   was mobilized during some summer storms, particularly in late July of
   each year. Also, SO42- and alkalinity varied markedly during storms. As
   determined from the routine weekly sampling, the streamwater was
   sufficiently neutral to indicate that streamwater acidification by
   acidic atmospheric deposition was relatively unimportant: only 26\% of
   the decrease in alkalinity was associated with SO42- concentration
   increases. The storm data, however, indicated that streamwater
   acidification did not occur during the storms sampled, but that the
   median alkalinity was much lower and SO42- concentrations were much
   higher than values determined from the weekly (base flow) sampling. The
   storm-sampling results indicate that episodic acidification may occur at
   PMRW.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of the inorganic quality of the groundwater of the Birmingham
   Triassic sandstone aquifer was carried out by sampling seventy 80-150 m
   deep industrial abstraction boreholes, 11 shallow monitoring
   piezometers, two submerged tunnels and two flooded industrial basements,
   and a set of trial pits. Borehole logging and historical data were also
   obtained.
   Given that the city of Birmingham is as long established as most
   industrial conurbations in the world, the degree of groundwater
   inorganic contamination as indicated by abstraction well samples is not
   excessive. Out of the 28 determinands measured, only NO3- and Ba2+
   consistently approach and exceed their European Community Maximum
   Admissible Concentrations standards for drinking water and the barium is
   being supplied by the aquifer rather than having an anthropogenic
   source. However, a few abstraction boreholes have highly contaminated
   groundwaters, with for example milligram per litre levels of heavy
   metals. In addition, there is a correlation between land use and
   chemistry, with the highest salinity, sulphate, chloride, sodium, boron,
   and total heavy metal concentrations being associated with metal-working
   sites. High concentrations of heavy metals (and NH4+ are unexpected in
   the near-neutral pH Triassic sandstone groundwaters given the high
   sorption capacity of the sandstone: it is concluded that one reason for
   the occasionally high concentrations observed is the presence of very
   locialized high concentration recharge. Data from shallow piezometers
   confirm the considerable degree of heterogeneity in groundwater quality
   on a small scale - the pollution is mainly from point sources. Sampling
   from piezometers, tunnels, and basements demonstrates that the
   groundwater concentrations at shallow depths are often much higher than
   the pumped water analyses suggest. However, nitrate groundwaters appear
   to vary much less with depth than other species, reflecting a longer
   history of supply and a wider range of sources. Geophysical logging and
   sampling of well columns, and other observations indicate that the
   intermittent pumping of abstraction wells results in the pumped water
   quality being biased towards the shallower, high concentrations
   groundwaters rather than being a uniform mixture from all screened
   depths. Historical data show various trends, and these can be related to
   local hydrogeology, land use, and abstraction history. Comparisons of
   organic and inorganic pollution show that distributions are very
   different, reflecting differences in physical transport processes,
   chemical interactions, and histories of chemical usage.}},

Abstract = {{Multilevel slug tests provide one means of obtaining estimates of
   hydraulic conductivity on a scale of relevance for contaminant transport
   investigations. A numerical model is employed here to assess the
   potential of multilevel slug tests to provide information about vertical
   variations in hydraulic conductivity under conditions commonly faced in
   field settings. The results of the numerical simulations raise several
   important issues concerning the effectiveness of this technique. If the
   length of the test interval is of the order of the average layer
   thickness, considerable error may be introduced into the conductivity
   estimates owing to the effects of adjoining layers. The influence of
   adjoining layers is dependent on the aspect ratio (length of test
   interval/well radius) of the test interval and the flow properties of
   the individual layers. If a low-permeability skin is present at the
   well, the measured vertical variations will be much less than the actual
   variations, owing to the influence of the skin conductivity on the
   parameter estimates. A high-permeability skin can also produce apparent
   vertical variations that are much less than the actual, owing to water
   flowing vertically along the conductive skin. In cases where the test
   interval spans a number of layers, a slug test will yield an approximate
   thickness-weighted average of the hydraulic conductivities of the
   intersected layers. In most cases, packer circumvention should not be a
   major concern when packers of 0.75 m or longer are employed. Results of
   this study are substantiated by recently reported field tests that
   demonstrate the importance of well emplacement and development
   activities for obtaining meaningful estimates from a program of
   multilevel slug tests.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term water use of a plantation of river red gum (Eucalyptus
   camaldulensis) was estimated using a groundwater hydrographic separation
   technique and compared with transpiration rate estimated by sap flow
   measurements using the heat pulse method. The recession components of
   hydrographs of wells inside and outside the plantation were compared for
   a period of 24 months. During summer the difference in gradient between
   the two well locations was assumed to equal the water use by the
   plantation. With this assumption, the hydrograph separation technique
   allowed differences between rates of transpiration to be estimated.
   Water use was found to range from 0.9 to 1.3 mm day-1 in summer, based
   on analysis of the recession curve, and 0.95 mm day-1 in winter, based
   on the accession curve. Stand transpiration, estimated by the heat pulse
   method, was found to be 0.96 mm day-1. In native woodland where water
   levels are deeper (up to 16 m) the ascending components of the
   hydrographs of wells inside and outside the woodland were used to
   estimate the water use of the woodland. This was found also to be 0.9 mm
   day-1.}},

Abstract = {{Evaporation was measured along three altitudinal transects on Mauna Loa,
   on the island of Hawai'i. Stations lie between 70 and 3400 m a.s.l. and
   included environments ranging from tropical rainforest with 6 m year-1
   annual rainfall to barren, subalpine lava fields in a dry environment
   above a persistent, subsidence temperature inversion. Average daily
   evaporation decreased with elevation between sea-level and about 1200 m,
   and then increased with elevation above that level. Evaporation minima
   ranged from 1.9 to 2.2 mm day-1. The maximum evaporation rate, 6.1 mm
   day-1, was at the highest site, Mauna Loa Observatory at 3400 m.
   Analysis of pan-evaporation data collected at 3400 m showed that
   standard formulae based on other meteorological variables provided good
   approximations of measured evaporation. Transect data were also compared
   with similar measurements from mountains on other Hawaiian islands.}},

Abstract = {{A simple technique for short-scale rainfall disaggregation is developed
   and studied both theoretically and empirically. This technique can be
   combined with a variety of rainfall models. The simplest implementation
   of the technique for a Markovian structure at a discrete time with only
   three parameters is studied in detail as an easy and convenient
   engineering tool for design storm and flood studies. Combining the
   disaggregation technique with a succession of simple hydrological
   models, i.e. a production function, a unit hydrograph and a flood
   routing model, we form a stochastic approach for design storm and flood
   synthesis. Similar to common engineering methods, the proposed method
   starts with the selection of certain characteristics of the design storm
   (i.e. its duration and total depth that correspond to a given return
   period). Subsequently, the method generates a series of probable time
   distributions by disaggregating the given total depth into incremental
   depths. Then the series of hyetographs is routed through the
   hydrological models and the result is the conditional probability
   distribution function of the outflow peak of the hydraulic construction
   studied, given the duration and total storm depth. From this
   distribution we can adopt the design discharge either as the conditional
   expected value of the outflow peak or as a value corresponding to a
   selected probability level. The method is illustrated with a real-world
   example and compared with common engineering methods.}},

Abstract = {{Grouting to reduce fracture permeability is one option for minimizing
   ground water inflow to a large, acid-producing lead-zinc mine in
   fractured metamorphic rock in north Idaho. For grouting to reduce mine
   water inflow effectively, the hydrogeologic characteristics of the
   various scales of structurally controlled fracturing must be identified
   and a conceptual model of the ground water flow system must be
   developed. This paper is the first of two papers which use fracture
   mapping, geologic structural mapping, and a series of underground
   hydraulic stress tests to develop a conceptual model of structurally
   controlled ground water flow in the vicinity of the mine. These data
   were collected in an effort to identify order within the structurally
   controlled spatial permeability distribution.
   Geologic structural discontinuities, ranging from joints to faults that
   extend for several miles, form a geologic structural hierarchy in the
   rock surrounding the mine. The tiers of the hierarchy control ground
   water flow into the mine at different scales. The most prominent faults
   control ground water inflow on the scale of the entire mine. Various
   levels of hydraulic continuity are evident within the rock mass bounded
   by two of the most prominent faults. The highest level of hydraulic
   continuity appears to be associated with a set of sub-parallel, steeply
   dipping faults. Minor faults,joints, and relict bedding planes to a
   limited extent connect the fractures of this set and form a lower level
   of hydraulic continuity. The next lower level of hydraulic continuity
   within the hierarchy is related to a major fault that is characterized
   in drill core by abundant gouge. The hydraulic continuity of the matrix
   within the unfractured quartzite is the lowest level within the
   hierarchy. These levels constitute the components of the order within
   the spatial permeability distribution that we have interpreted from the
   structural and hydraulic stress test data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is the second of two papers that address the influence of
   geologic structures on ground water flow at various scales in fractured
   rocks. The ultimate purpose of this research is to investigate the
   feasibility of grouting preferentially permeable zones as a strategy to
   minimize the production of acid mine drainage in underground hard rock
   mines in which the major permeability is structure and fracture
   controlled. The aim of grouting is to reduce permeability around
   mined-out openings, to minimize the rate of inflow of ground water into
   such openings via the structurally controlled preferentially permeable
   pathways.
   A series of hydraulic stress tests were conducted to help characterize
   the role of geologic structures in controlling the ground water flow
   system in the vicinity of the Bunker Hill Mine in north Idaho. The
   results of these tests indicate that most of the ground water that flows
   from the underground drillholes used for hydraulic stress testing is
   derived from a few discrete, structurally produced fracture zones that
   are more or less connected through smaller-scale fractures. Four types
   of analytical models are considered as a means of analyzing the results
   of multiple drillhole hydraulic stress tests, as follows: cross-hole
   equivalent porous media; double-porosity equivalent porous media; a
   solution to flow in and around a single vertical fracture; leaky
   equivalent porous media, partial penetration. The estimation of
   hydraulic coefficients in complex fractured rock environments involves
   the combined application of a number of deterministic analytical models.
   The models to be used are selected dependent on the location of the
   drawdown observations relative to the water-producing zone and the
   length of the test. The result of the tests can be related to the
   permeability hierarchy discussed in our first paper}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal dynamics of soil water, the annual water balances over a period
   of 30 years (1960-1990) and the frequency of occurrence of extreme water
   shortage were quantified with the model `SWIF' for a Douglas fir stand
   on a sandy soil in the Netherlands. This information was needed for
   evaluating the impact of air pollution and water shortage on forest
   growth, and to calculate chemical budgets. Measurements necessary for
   model parameterization included rainfall, throughfall, transpiration,
   soil water content and soil water pressure head. These data are
   available for 3 years. For the period without measurements, throughfall
   and potential evapotranspiration were calculated from synoptic weather
   data with an empirical model. The effect of using synoptic weather data
   instead of detailed on-site measured data was analysed. The results show
   that after calibration of the empirical model the simulated annual water
   balance and seasonal soil water dynamics were well described with
   synoptic weather data as well as with detailed on-site measured data.
   The modelled annual water balances for the period 1960-1990 are
   presented as cumulative frequency distributions. Median values of the
   major terms of the water balance and the frequency of occurrence of
   extreme water shortage were derived from these diagrams. Annual median
   precipitation was 834 mm, calculated median interception loss 317 mm,
   median transpiration 363 mm, median soil water evaporation 32 mm and
   median vertical drainage at 150 cm depth 195 mm. The sum of the major
   losses is not equal to median annual precipitation as the median values
   of the individual terms may occur in different years. Transpiration
   shows smaller variations (11\%) between the years than through-fall
   (54\%) and vertical drainage (12\%). Although the median value of
   transpiration reduction resulting from water stress is low (4\%), some
   years showed extreme water shortage, the highest transpiration reduction
   being 31\% for 1976. Although total transpiration reduction during
   median years is low, short periods with considerable drought stress
   occur during these years.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the results of empirical and model-based analysis of
   extreme flood events observed in a small basin. The study catchment,
   WE-38 Mahantango Creek (7.2 km2), is situated in the North Appalachian
   Valley and Ridge province of eastern Pennsylvania. Data from four rain
   gauges and one water level station are available at 5 min intervals.
   From the observations, 12 flood events were selected for detailed
   analysis. The data include tropical storm Agnes (21-24 June 1972), which
   was responsible for one of the most devastating floods in the region.
   Model-based analysis of hydrologic response is used to study the
   dominating runoff processes in the catchment. In this study, we use a
   distributed version of Topmodel to model runoff generation, and a lumped
   hillslope and channel routing model to model overland flow and channel
   flow. The runoff generation model relies on a topographic index to
   predict saturation excess runoff and on Philip's infiltration equation
   to predict infiltration excess runoff. The runoff routing model is based
   on the channel network width function and on the drainage basin
   hillslope function. The relative roles of initial conditions, soil
   properties and rainfall rates in determining hydrologic response in the
   basin are investigated. The flood frequency distribution seems to be
   insensitive to scaled maximum rainfall intensity. However, the flood
   frequency distribution is strongly affected by the scaled initial
   storage capacity. Simulated hydrograph characteristics, such as peak
   discharge, are very sensitive to the overland flow velocity parameter in
   the routing model.}},

Abstract = {{Evaporation was computed by the energy-budget method for two north
   Florida lakes with similar surface areas but different depths, for the
   period May 1989 to December 1990. Lake Barco, in north-central Florida,
   is shallow, with an average depth of 3 m; Lake Five-0, in the Florida
   panhandle, is considerably deeper, with an average depth of 9.5 m. As a
   result, the thermal regime and seasonal evaporation rates of the lakes
   are different. Evaporation from the shallower lake was higher than that
   from the deeper lake in the winter and spring. In the late summer and
   autumn, however, the situation is reversed. Evaporation from the shallow
   lake is directly related to the amount of incoming shortwave radiation
   because of its limited ability to store energy. The lag in evaporation
   at the deeper lake is a function of the greater amount of heat that it
   seasonally stores and releases. The difference in annual evaporation
   between Lake Barco (151 cm year-1) and Lake Five-O (128 cm year-1) is
   related to differences in regional climatic conditions between the two
   sites. Additionally, higher than normal evaporation rates at the two
   lakes are probably related to drought conditions experienced in north
   Florida during 1990, which resulted in higher temperatures and more
   incoming radiation. Monthly evaporation at Lake Barco could usually be
   estimated within 10\% of the energy-budget evaporation using a constant
   pan coefficient. This lake may be representative of other shallow lakes
   that do not store considerable heat. Monthly evaporation at Lake Five-O,
   however, could not be estimated accurately by using an annual pan
   coefficient because of the large seasonal influence of change in stored
   heat. Monthly mass-transfer evaporation compared well with energy-budget
   evaporation at Lake Barco, but did not compare well at Lake Five-O.
   These errors may also be associated with changes in heat storage. Thus,
   the thermal regime of the lake must be considered to estimate accurately

Abstract = {{The flow of water in a finite soil layer is analyzed with gravity,
   extending an earlier non-gravitational theory. Analytical approximations
   are obtained to predict the outflow at the lower surface when the

   the predictions is checked by comparison with numerical simulations. The
   solution should be of importance to infer soil properties from outflow
   measurements in laboratory experiments. The time when outflow first
   begins and the steady state flow rate are especially useful for that
   purpose.}},

Abstract = {{To associate a confidence interval with the results of a soil water
   balance, an estimate of the errors involved in the measurements and in
   the calculations is required. Volumetric water content, water storage
   and actual evapotranspiration were calculated from daily neutron
   scattering and tensiometer measurements, and the instrument, calibration
   and vertical integration components of their variance were compared from
   a local standpoint. In contrast to foregoing studies, water content
   values at different depths were not considered to be necessarily
   independent of one another, introducing supplementary covariance terms
   in the calculations. As an illustration, results are presented for two
   irrigated maize fields from the EFEDA experiment conducted in Spain in
   June 1991. The standard deviation of the total error was less than the
   standard deviation of either water storage or computed
   evapotranspiration between measurements.}},

   the calibration, instrument, integration and location components of the

Title = {{SALINE GROUNDWATER IN ISRAEL - ITS BEARING ON THE WATER CRISIS IN THE

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1994}},

Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{389-430}},

Abstract = {{One of the major causes for the deterioration of water quality bearing
   heavily on the water crisis in Israel is the ongoing contamination of
   its water resources by saline water bodies. The present paper reviews
   the geochemical processes forming saline water, lists and explains
   certain chemical and isotopic parameters which enable understanding
   these processes and describes the saline groundwater bodies and various
   salinization phenomena occurring in the country's various aquifers.
   Deterioration of groundwater in Israel is caused by numerous natural
   processes such as encroachment of sea water, migration of connate,
   highly pressurized brines penetrating into fresh groundwater, by
   subsurface dissolution of soluble salts originating in surrounding
   country rocks and by water-rock interaction. In addition to sea water,
   two saline water bodies were identified as the main factors causing
   salinization of fresh groundwater: (a) Ca-chloride brines encountered in
   the Jordan-Dead Sea Rift Valley, in various parts of the Negev and of
   the Coastal Plain, and (b) Na-chloride saline water identified in the
   subsurface of the Negev and in the southern part of the Coastal Plain.
   Intensive exploitation of groundwater in Israel has disturbed the
   natural equilibrium which prevailed between fresh and saline water. The
   newly established groundwater flow regimes have facilitated the
   migration of saline water bodies, their participation in the active
   hydrological cycle and the progressive contamination of fresh
   groundwater. These processes which were not anticipated by planners and
   water resources managers emphasize that large-scale groundwater
   exploitation was undertaken without giving sufficient consideration to
   the occurrence and subsurface migration of saline water and brines.}},

Abstract = {{One hundred and thirty six experiments were conducted on runoff plots on
   semiarid grassland and shrubland hillslopes at Walnut Gulch, Arizona.
   Graphs of Darcy-Weisbach friction factor f against Reynolds number Re
   are positively sloping or convex-upward for the grassland and
   predominantly negatively sloping for the shrubland. These trends are
   attributed to the progressive inundation of the roughness elements, with
   the submergence of the gravel on the shrubland being greater than the
   submergence of the plants on the grassland.
   The f-Re relations are of little value as models for predicting flow
   resistance at locations other than where they were developed because
   each location has its own unique relation which is a function of the
   surface properties at that location. Consequently, multivariate models
   that include surface properties among their predictive variables were
   derived for the grassland and shrubland hillslopes using multiple
   regression analysis. On the grassland 69.5\% of the variation infis
   accounted for by basal plant stem and litter cover, whereas on the
   shrubland 56.3\% of the variation is explained by gravel cover and
   gravel size. The inclusion of Re improves the explained variation by
   5.4\% on the grassland and 7.6\% on the shrubland. These results suggest
   that for most purposes the extra effort involved in measuring or
   modeling flow rate is not worth the small improvement in predictive
   accuracy and, therefore, that the practice of estimating resistance to
   overland flow solely on the basis of surface properties is entirely
   reasonable.
   A comparison of the two sets of experiments reveals that both
   infiltration and resistance to flow are higher on grassland than
   shrubland. Consequently, where shrubland has replaced grassland during
   the past century, in addition to the ground surface becoming more
   exposed to raindrop impact, overland flow has increased in volume and
   velocity. Together these changes have resulted in accelerated erosion in
   the form of rill development and stripping of the soil A horizon.}},

Abstract = {{The displacement and recovery of surface-applied. (NO3)-N-15, H-2 and
   Cl- in the unsaturated zone of the British Upper Chalk was followed over
   a 4 year period. Recovery of Cl- in the chalk matrix under the treated
   plot was equivalent to 110\% of that applied. That of H-2 was 57\% in
   the treated plot. Lateral flow of H-2 was evident from cores taken
   outside the plot, and if this is included, together with H-2 estimated
   to have been lost by evapotranspiration, the recovery approached 100\%.
   Recovery of (NO3)-N-15 was 100\% 1 year after tracer application,
   falling to 9.4\% after 4 years. No evidence of denitrification was
   obtained from background NO3 cores, and it was concluded that the
   shortfall in NO3 recovery was due to uptake by grass from depths of
   50-70 cm. The tracer profiles and recoveries were not consistent with
   significant vertical macrofissure flow, but the lack of seasonal
   periodicity in background H-2 profiles suggested that some microfissure
   flow could be occurring. The displacement of the tracer peaks, when
   considered with the estimates of recharge, indicated that only 50\% of
   the water-filled matrix was conducting flow.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of two hydrological parametrization schemes have been
   assessed  in the framework of a one-dimensional (column) version of such
   a model by comparing the results with observed data for catchments in
   southern England. The schemes, for use in global circulation models,
   were the standard one from the UK Meteorological Office model and the
   ARNO or Nanjing model. The ARNO scheme is designed to represent the
   heterogeneity of the hydrological properties over the area, whereas the
   standard scheme has hydrological characteristics based on data for
   single points. The standard scheme gave deficient runoff through most of
   the year, particularly for the summer and autumn. The ARNO scheme was
   found to be capable, with careful choice of model parameters, of
   simulating the main seasonal variation in runoff for the catchments
   considered. The principal residual problem is that runoff is deficient
   in summer. This probably reflects the difficulty of representing a
   complex hydrological system with one soil moisture variable. In
   particular, to simulate runoff correctly, groundwater storage needs to
   be modelled. The results also indicated possible improvements in other
   aspects of the model including the specification of stomatal resistance
   and the inclusion of aerosols.}},

Abstract = {{A parametrization scheme for the Interactions between Soil, Biosphere
   and Atmosphere (ISBA), has been implemented in the French spectral
   general circulation model (GCM) Emeraude. ISBA represents surface
   physical processes including the variability of soil hydrological
   properties and the influence of vegetation cover on the exchanges
   between the soil-cover system and the atmosphere. The main
   characteristics of the scheme, and the more recent improvements
   concerning the tropical rain forest, are briefly described. The method
   used to derive the maps of the surface parameters is also presented. Two
   3 year experiments with and without ISBA are compared, with special
   emphasis on the results at specific locations where observations are
   available. The general features of the model climatology are found to be
   independent of the inclusion of the scheme. With ISBA, the model gives a
   lower surface soil temperature, mainly owing to an increased surface
   albedo, and an intensification of the hydrological cycle. A more
   striking response to the inclusion of ISBA is the improved partitioning
   of the surface energy budget, which then agrees moderately well with the
   observations over different systems of land cover. A comparison with
   previous GCM experiments with new land surface parametrizations shows
   that the models with the new schemes are in better agreement with each
   other and with the observations over the Amazon region.}},

Abstract = {{The advective transport of atmospheric water vapor, its role in global
   hydrology, and the water balance of continental regions are discussed
   and explored. A data set consisting of 10 years of global wind and
   humidity observations that has been interpolated onto a regular grid is
   used to estimate atmospheric water vapor fluxes across the boundaries of
   selected continental regions. The flux of water vapor from the waters
   surrounding the Americas is computed and graphically represented as
   integrated normal flux across meridional and zonal segments. The total
   flux is decomposed into transport by mean motion and transport by
   correlated transient anomalies in the wind and humidity fields. Seasonal
   maps of these observations for the Americas reveal the underlying
   mechanisms and illustrate the characterizing features of the hydrologic
   cycle and continental water balance for this large land mass.}},

Abstract = {{Downhole electromagnetic (EM) profiles have been used to study the salt
   distribution in four catchments in the wheatbelt of Western Australia.
   The good correlation (r2 = 0.7-0.9) obtained by relating the apparent
   conductivity profiles measured by the downhole EM with salt profiles
   from soil cores enabled estimation of the salt storage in the uncored
   wells. The salt distribution was compared with ground conductivity
   surveys (using EM31 and EM34 instruments) in three catchments and with
   an INPUT aerial electromagnetic survey (AEM) in a fourth catchment. The
   study revealed the presence of five types of apparent electrical
   conductivity profiles (ECa) which are correlated with the basin
   geomorphological units. The conductivity profiles are: (1) low ECa
   (recharge) profile; (2) subsurface peak (discharge) profile; (3) two
   bulge profiles - a single bulge (accumulation-weathering) profile and a
   split (aquifer development) profile; (4) reduced bulge (leaching)
   profile; (5) high ECa irregular (palaeochannel) profile. The salt
   distribution showed a systematic increase in salinity from the
   watersheds to the valleys with salinity increasing upstream of
   geological structures. The salt distribution was found to be controlled
   by the geomorphologic properties of the basins, which control the
   hydrological and hydrogeological processes, and by the recharge
   discharge mechanisms which influence salt mobilization and accumulation.}},

Abstract = {{The convective dispersion equation is often used as a functional
   description of solute transport in soils. In this paper the problem of
   salt or chemical accumulation near the soil surface under the conditions
   of an upward evaporative flux is solved analytically for both a constant
   water content and a depth-dependent water content that is invariant with
   time. The depth-dependent water content profile is obtained by use of
   the Gardner solution for steady-state evaporation from a shallow water
   table. It is shown that under the conditions encountered in the Valais
   Canton, Switzerland, the concentration profile that develops with time
   under steady-state evaporative conditions from a shallow water table can
   be obtained with sufficient accuracy for field conditions using a
   constant water content. The concentration profile which develops with
   time depends upon both the upward evaporative flux of water, which
   concentrates solutes at the surface, and the diffusive-dispersive flux,
   which tends to move solutes downward against the upward flux of water.
   Examples illustrate the influence of velocity and dispersion effects on
   the solute profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Observations reveal a close relationship between groundwater depth and
   stream net characteristics in the permeable lowlands of the sandy
   Pleistocene area of the Netherlands. This applies for average conditions
   as well as for the seasonal expansion and contraction of the network of
   streams that participate in the drainage process. It is plausible that
   this observed relation is caused by the close connection between
   groundwater and surface water in an area where almost all precipitation
   surplus is discharged as groundwater. Under such conditions a stream
   system can be considered the outcrop of a groundwater flow system. The
   hypothesis is that the stream network, as the interface between both
   systems, must have adapted in response to the discharge capacity that is
   required to release the precipitation surplus through the continuum of
   ground waters and surface waters.
   A theoretical model of coupled groundwater and surface water drainage
   systems is proposed that gives the stream net density and channel
   dimensions as functions of the geological and climatic conditions. The
   theoretically derived relationships of increasing stream density and
   decreasing channel size with reducing depth to groundwater and reducing
   topgraphic slope reflect the observed situation. The model further
   allows for assessment of the response of a drainage network to a
   changing environment.}},

Abstract = {{Transpiration, pre-dawn shoot water potential and growth of Norway
   spruce trees were measured for one growing season, under three water
   regimes, giving a seasonal water input of 696 mm (irrigated), 579 mm
   (control) and 270 mm (drought). Potential transpiration was calculated
   from the Penman-Monteith equation, using maximal canopy conductance as a
   function of vapour pressure deficit. Sap flow was measured by a
   tree-trunk heat balance method and the data were expressed per unit
   ground surface. This allowed calculation of canopy conductance (g(c))
   for the three treatments. The median of the daytime g(c) was about 1.1
   cm s-1 for non-limiting water conditions, and about 0.5 cm s-1 for the
   conditions of a moderate water deficit. Pre-dawn water potential did not
   decrease until daily transpiration rates were substantially reduced,
   with corresponding g(c) of 0.2 cm s-1. The type of control which limits
   transpiration is discussed. The basal-area growth was related closely to
   the amount of water infiltrated into the soil. The estimated long-term
   tree water-use efficiency (the total dry matter produced per unit of
   water transpired) was on average 4.8 g kg-1, with insignificant
   differences between the treatments. Seasonal transpiration reached 380
   mm, 325 mm and 209 mm for the irrigated, control and drought treatment,

Abstract = {{The stable isotopes oxygen-18 and deuterium were used to determine the
   seasonal contributions of snow and rain to the soil and groundwater
   systems of a prairie agricultural site during the period, 1985-1987.
   Using measured isotope values and a temperature-isotope relationship the
   isotope values of precipitation during the previous 10 years at
   Edmonton, Canada, were determined. Winter precipitation had average
   oxygen-18 and deuterium values of -25.6 parts per thousand and -194
   parts per thousand, respectively; spring through autumn rains had
   weighted values of -16.2 parts per thousand and -125 parts per thousand,
   respectively. Soil samples taken in the top 4 m indicated that mixing of
   infiltrating waters was generally complete by a depth of 30 cm. With
   algebraic manipulation of measured isotope concentrations of soil and
   precipitation waters with known physical processes, it was possible to
   estimate the seasonal composition of the waters in the top 4 m. After
   correction for evaporation, both soil water (0-0.9 m) and shallow
   groundwater (3-4 m) had lower oxygen-18 values (-18.7 parts per
   thousand; and -20.3 parts per thousand, respectively) than the weighted
   average annual precipitation concentration (-18.1 parts per thousand).
   Using isotopes the snow-water composition of soil water was estimated to
   be 27\% and of groundwater to be 44\%. These values are higher than the
   proportion of winter precipitation of total annual precipitation (21\%
   with rains less-than-or-equal-to 5 mm day-1 excluded). The higher
   snow-water content of groundwater, along with the fact that the
   groundwater underwent less fractionation owing to evaporation than soil
   waters, could be the result of lateral flow from nearby small
   depressions where snowmelt runoff waters accumulated during spring.
   These findings emphasize the importance of the contribution of winter
   precipitation to groundwater recharge.}},

Abstract = {{Cell models consist of a finite number of cell units, each representing
   a certain portion of the watershed. The cells are interconnected in a
   tree-like structure simulating the main drainage pattern in the
   watershed. Each model cell unit is composed of three elements-one for
   converting rainfall excess on the cell area into surface runoff at the
   cell outlet, one to convert channel inflow to the cell into channel
   outflow, and an element that adds the outputs of the other two elements,
   which are in parallel, to produce the total outflow from the cell unit.
   Conventional channel routing methods used for channel inflow-outflow
   conversion have deficiencies which make them difficult to apply for cell
   models. A new, simple, routing element is presented and its properties
   are discussed. The new routing method is described as `rational' because
   it overcomes the deficiencies of other routing methods.}},

Abstract = {{On the basis of a broadly expanding data base, the hydrogeological
   properties of the Judea Group sequence in the northern Negev and
   southern Coastal Plain of Israel have been reassessed. The updated
   subsurface model is based on data derived from water- and oil-wells and
   on recent large-scale geophysical investigations. A new regional pattern
   of faults extending through the subsurface of the study area has been
   revealed. In view of the reassessed geological and hydrological
   subsurface setting, it appears that the Judea Group aquifer should not
   be regarded as one continuous and undisturbed hydrological unit; owing
   to the occurrence of regional faults, its subaquifers are locally
   interconnected. These subaquifers, which contain mainly high-quality
   water, are juxtaposed, as a result of faulting, against Kurnub Group
   sandstones containing brackish paleowater. The latter Group is faulted
   against late Jurassic formations containing highly saline groundwater.
   In the Beer Sheva area, the Judea Group aquifer is vertically displaced
   against the Senonian and Eocene Mt. Scopus and Avdat Groups, which also
   contain brackish and saline water. In the southern Coastal Plain, major
   faults locally dissect also the Pleistocene Kurkar Group, facilitating
   inflow of Mg-rich groundwater deriving from Judea Group dolomites. The
   new geological evidence and its hydrogeological implications provide new
   solutions for previously unexplained salinization phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanics of groundwater flow through fractured rock has become an
   object of major research interest during recent years. This project has
   investigated the flow of groundwater through fractured Precambrian
   metaquartzite rocks in a portion of the Bunker Hill Mine near Kellogg,
   Idaho. Groundwater flow through these types of rocks is largely
   dependent upon the properties of fractures such as faults, joints and
   relict bedding planes. Groundwater that flows into the mine via the
   fractures is acidic and is contaminated by heavy metals, which results
   in a severe acid mine drainage problem. A more complete understanding of
   how the fractures influence the groundwater flow system is a
   prerequisite of the evaluation of reclamation alternatives to reduce
   acid drainage from the mine.
   Fracture mapping techniques were used to obtain detailed information on
   the fracture properties observed in the New East Reed drift of the
   Bunker Hill Mine. The information obtained includes fracture type,
   orientation, trace length, the number of visible terminations,
   roughness, waviness, infilling material, and a qualitative measure of
   the amount of water flowing through each fracture. The hydrogeologic
   field data collected include routine measurements of the discharge from
   four individual structural features and four areas where large
   quantities of water are discharging from vertical rock bolts, the depths
   to water in three piezometer nests at the ground surface, the pressure
   variations in four diamond drillholes, and constant discharge flow tests
   conducted on three of the diamond drillholes.
   The field data indicate that relict bedding planes are the primary
   conduits for groundwater flow, and suggest that the two major joint sets
   that are present connect water flowing through the discontinuous bedding
   planes. The three minor joint sets that are present do not seem to have
   a significant impact on groundwater flow, but along with the two major
   joint sets may store relatively large quantities of water. It appears
   that rock-bolt holes in the central portion of the drift primarily
   intersect relict bedding planes, whereas rock-bolt holes in the
   southeastern portion of the drift primarily intersect joints; this
   probably is related to the shallower angle of dip of the bedding planes
   in the central portion of the drift. It also appears that recharge from
   the surface directly above the mined-out openings is the primary source
   of water in the upper workings of the mine, and that the large seasonal
   head variations in the potentiometric surface are primarily responsible
   for the observed temporal variations in mine inflow. Infilling material
   may control the hydrogeologic character of the faults, with those filled
   with gouge having low hydraulic conductivities and those filled with
   breccia having relatively high hydraulic conductivities. In addition,
   one of the faults may act as a positive (constant head recharge)
   hydrogeologic boundary. A double-porosity approach probably is the most
   appropriate for simulating the groundwater flow system in the vicinity
   of the New East Reed drift. Finally, grouping of a combination of
   breccia-filled faults and relict bedding planes may offer the best hope
   for minimizing mine-water inflow or recharge.}},

   is developed. The simulation mode output of an auxilliary simple linear

   realistic functional relationships between the gain factor and the
   prevailing catchment wetness index are assumed. The resulting model,
   referred to as the variable gain factor model (VGFM), is tested on the
   data of five catchments, assuming two different functional forms of gain
   factor variation with the catchment wetness index. The results indicate
   significant improvement over the performance of the simple linear model
   for the test catchments. The operation of the model is shown to be

Abstract = {{The activated charcoal passive collector method can be applied to
   measure the concentration of Rn-222 in river water. The Rn-222 collector
   is composed of dry activated charcoal sealed in a polyethylene bag.
   However, we found it very difficult to keep activated charcoal in a
   collector dry during the period the collector was left in a river. The
   degree of dampness and the time lapsed when activated charcoal became
   wet were thought to affect the quantity of Rn-222 collected. First, we
   studied the effect of some parameters in the activated charcoal passive
   collector method qualitatively in three experiments. We found that the
   quantity of Rn-222 collected in a collector was not so sensitive to the
   quantity of activated charcoal in the collector or the thickness of
   polyethylene film under the condition of wet activated charcoal, and
   that wet activated charcoal accumulated less Rn-222 than dry activated
   charcoal. We present some equations which could explain how much Rn-222
   was collected in a collector when activated charcoal was submerged
   directly in water and when activated charcoal was packed in a
   polyethylene bag but completely wet. These equations were proved
   effective by being compared with the results of the other experiments.
   Finally, we recommended some conditions which proved useful when
   measuring at an actual river.}},

Abstract = {{The Poisson model for rainfall occurrences in which storm intensity and
   duration are represented by two independent random variables is extended
   to consider intensity and duration as bivariate random variables each
   with a marginal exponential distribution. A numerical optimization
   method using annual maxima is adopted for parameters estimation.
   Comparison is made with the results of a numerical procedure which uses
   the Gumbel distribution as an approximation to the probability
   distribution of the extremes of the bivariate exponential model. A case
   study is presented using data from 18 raingauge stations in northern
   Italy. For rainfall durations of practical interest the theoretically
   derived relationships between probabilities and intensities compare
   favourably with observed relationships.}},

Abstract = {{The Republic of Djibouti is the location of an exceptional geodynamic
   situation, the Afar Depression, which is an emerged triple junction of
   the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the East African rifts, where a fault
   network is particularly well developed and controls the permeability of
   volcanic aquifers. Pumping test data are analysed for two major basaltic
   series, the stratiform series (3.4-1 Ma) and the Dalha series (9-3.4
   Ma), which are distinguished mainly by their geodynamic characteristics
   and geological history although they are both recognized as trap rocks.
   Drawdown and recovery were studied by Jacob's logarithmic approximation
   of the Theis equation and by the Theis recovery method. Elsewhere, step
   drawdown data were interpreted with the Cooper-Jacob graphical solution
   and Rorabough's method. The results describe aquifers in the stratiform
   and Dalha basalts which are identified by different hydrodynamic
   characteristics. Stratiform and Dalha aquifer transmissivities range
   from 1.5 x 10(-4) to 5.7 x 10(-1) m2 s-1 and from 2.9 x 10(-6) to 1.6 x
   10(-2) m2 s-1. Storage coefficients determined from piezometer
   observations and computer simulations describe the aquifers in the Gulf
   basalts, a particular type of the stratiform series, as semiconfined,
   and those in the Dalha basalts as confined or unconfined depending on
   the area. Thus, the calculated specific capacity demonstrated that the
   stratiform basalt aquifers have more favourable hydrodynamic
   characteristics than the Dalha basalt aquifers. Specific capacities vary
   between 0.372 and 510.01 m3 h-1 m-1 within the stratiform basalts and
   between 0.008 and 35.2 m3 h-1 m-1 in the Dalha basalts. As they were
   originally composed of the same type of trap rocks, the stratiform and
   Dalha basalts should have a similar magnitude of permeability, and this
   was confirmed by some wells. The lower specific capacities exhibited by
   the Dalha basalts is explained by a longer period of alteration and
   greater hydrothermal activity, as has been observed in well cuttings and
   field studies.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional finite element model of solute transport in a

   depth of impervious layer and adsorption on salt distribution in the

   considers steady state water flow in the unsaturated and saturated
   zones, and includes the effect of convective transport, dispersion and
   linear adsorption. The results indicate that though the depth of the
   impervious layer has little effect on salt distribution in the
   unsaturated zone, it significantly influences the quality of the
   drainage effluent. Further, it was found that during the initial years
   of reclamation of a highly saline soil with subsurface drainage, the
   effect of adsorption is more pronounced in the unsaturated zone than in
   the saturated zone and the movement of adsorbing solute species is
   retarded for a longer time in the groundwater than in the soil.}},

Abstract = {{The conceptual basis and structure of a semi-distributed, deterministic
   hydrological model is presented. The modelling time interval used is
   variable and changes automatically according to a series of user defined
   rainfall thresholds. The model represents a pragmatic compromise between
   highly detailed physically based and completely empirical approaches.
   This is achieved using a semi-distributed approach, but incorporating
   some effects at scales of less than the sub-area level. Model
   conceptualisations are based on the authors understanding of physical
   hydrology, but the complexity of the algorithms has been limited to
   prevent the model's information requirements from being too stringent.
   The model is designed to be applicable to a range of situations where a
   simulation of the components of catchment hydrology is required to solve
   a problem. The paper also briefly discusses the procedures used to
   estimate parameter values from readily obtainable physical catchment
   characteristics and presents some example simulations to illustrate the
   model's operation.}},

Abstract = {{In the study of unsaturated flow in the soil profile, the soil
   characteristic functions, one relating the pressure head to water
   saturation and the other relating the permeability to water saturation,
   are usually established with data covering a wide range. The application
   of these functions to situations with a mildly unsaturated range, such
   as encountered in a wet irrigation setting in a coarse soil, has been
   investigated. Certain shortcomings in using these soil characteristic
   functions directly have been identified, and modifications to the
   procedure of determining the characteristic functions have been proposed
   and tested. The improvements have been quantified in terms of the
   goodness of fit to published field measurements on the soil
   characteristics and also in terms of simulation results for an idealized
   test situation corresponding to irrigation practice in a relatively
   coarse soil. The special features of the C language have been utilized
   in developing a computer program for finite element modelling of the
   nonlinear Richards' equation describing unsaturated subsurface water
   flow. A weighted least-squares procedure improves the fit of the Brooks
   and Corey characteristic functions for pressure head vs. degree of
   saturation. A numerical integration procedure improves the fit of the
   Van Genuchten characteristic functions for permeability vs. degree of
   saturation. The present study indicates that even for sandy soil, the
   conventional Van Genuchten and Brooks and Corey soil characteristic
   functions need to be modified to yield acceptable results for the mildly
   unsaturated regime.}},

Abstract = {{Fluoride is a strong acid anion and a constituent of acid rain. Fluoride
   concentrations are elevated in surface waters in acidified areas in
   Norway. In July 1991, 100 muequiv l-1 fluoride in 15 mm artificial
   precipitation were added to a 0.38 ha pristine catchment at Sogndal,
   western Norway, to investigate fluoride mobility and its effects on
   runoff chemistry, in particular aluminium. Runoff chemistry responded
   with increased levels of Li and F, increased pH and concentrations of
   Al, but generally lower concentrations of the other major ions. About
   1.4\% of the added Li and 0.2\% of the added F left the catchment in
   runoff during the 14 days after treatment. The concurrent increase in pH
   and inorganic Al suggests anion exchange between the added F and OH
   adsorbed on the soil. The results further indicate that F may be
   mobilized by acidification, with subsequent complexation with inorganic
   Al.}},

Abstract = {{Evaporative groundwater-fed lakes in the glaciated North American Great
   Plains vary widely in chemistry. A contributing cause is chemical
   variability of.source groundwater intercepted by specific lakes, caused
   in part by differing depths of groundwater circulation. Aqueous chemical
   characteristics of 61 lakes and 160 groundwater samples were compared
   for an area where such lakes are common in eastern Montana-western North
   Dakota. Results indicate that groundwater chemistry varies according to
   depth in a similar fashion within different aquifers. Lake water
   evaporation from initial groundwater solutions typical of three depths
   was geochemically modeled using PHRQPITZ, based on a Pitzer treatment of
   activities and equilibria. Results show that chemistry of most lake
   waters in the study area may correspond to that predicted from
   evaporation of shallow- and intermediate-depth groundwater, but not of
   deep groundwater as postulated in some previous investigations. Lakes in
   shallow surface depressions receive water primarily from shallow (local)
   groundwater flow; lakes located in deep or broad topographic depressions
   may additionally receive groundwater from deeper circulation. In the
   field area studied, relative dominance of anions (sulfate vs. carbonate)
   in brines is a signature for inferred depth of source. Also diagnostic
   is the suite of brine salts formed (Na-SO4-Mg salts for shallow flow;
   these plus Na-CO3 salts for intermediate depth flow). Such source
   signatures will vary from area to area according to depth variations in
   groundwater chemistry and in stratigraphy. Chemical evolution of lake
   water is a two-stage process, with a groundwater path (influenced by
   residence time, depth of circulation, aquifer mineralogy, and related
   factors) and a surface path (influenced by evaporation rates,
   lake-aquifer hydraulics, and lake geochemical reactions). Groundwater
   flow patterns may affect the former set of factors, thereby indirectly
   controlling lake water chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Natural helium (He) concentration profiles in the sediments of lakes at
   the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario are modelled, using
   the advection-diffusion equation to calculate groundwater velocities.
   Two headwater lakes with little excess He in bottom water have sediment
   He concentration profiles indicating slow (2-7 cm a-1) recharge of lake
   water to groundwater. Data from three lakes showing He enrichment in
   bottom water indicate groundwater seepage at some sites. Sediment He
   gradients in headwater Lake 239 were usually weak, although a strong
   gradient was found at one site. Probes located within suspected seepage
   areas in Lake 239 indicated groundwater discharge velocities of 3-22 cm
   a-1. Fifth order Lake 240 had a He gradient suggesting groundwater
   seepage at 11-17 cm a-1. Eighth-order Lake 625, a lineament basin with
   high He concentrations in bottom water, had very strong He gradients in
   sediment. One probe indicated diffusive He transport through sediment,
   whereas another indicated seepage at 3-6 cm a-1. Direct He fluxes to the
   lakes, estimated from its accumulation in bottom water during summer
   stratification, are in reasonable agreement with fluxes calculated
   independently from the He gradients in sediment. Measurements of natural
   He gradients in lake sediment give a sensitive and reliable indication
   of the direction and rate of groundwater transport at velocities of
   1-100 cm a-1.}},

Abstract = {{Data from 18 field studies in the south western Murray Basin (Australia)
   and a simple water balance model were used to study the importance of
   factors which affect diffuse recharge in that area. Generally as the
   texture of the soil became heavier the recharge decreased. Under cropped
   land as the clay content in the top 2 m of the soil profile increased
   from 0 to 20\%, recharge decreased by one order of magnitude (from about
   30 to about 3 mm year-1, for a mean annual rainfall of 310-380 mm). As
   mean annual rainfall increased the mean annual recharge also increased.
   Sites with an average clay content of about 10\% in the top 2 m and a
   mean annual rainfall of 270 mm had an estimated recharge of about half
   that of sites with a mean annual rainfall of 310-380 mm. Data from land
   which was grazed but not cropped showed similar relationships. However,
   the data set did not allow a detailed analysis of the effect of land use
   on recharge.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has shown that irregular wetting and preferential flow
   may occur in heterogeneous field soils. Bare dune sands, which at first
   sight show the greatest homogeneity, were sampled volumetrically at nine
   locations in temperate and arid areas to determine the spatial
   distribution of soil moisture content, theta, and dry bulk density.
   Soil moisture patterns were irregular, even in extremely dry situations.
   As k - theta functions for dune sands are very steep in the dry theta
   range, small differences in water content result in huge differences in
   hydraulic conductivity, k. These differences, induced by soil moisture
   variability, may result in anisotropy of the system, and hysteresis
   tends to magnify this phenomenon. So, if soil moisture differences
   exist, they will be consolidated and even amplified during new rain
   events.
   At one site on a recently deposited dune sand, infiltrating water was
   able to transform a one-layer soil system into a two-layer soil system,
   inducing preferential flow at the layer interface. At another site,
   preferential flow paths appeared at the soil surface as `sand columns'
   as a result of the displacement of the dry sand between the flow paths,
   caused by wind erosion.
   In all the dunes studied, dry bulk density patterns were irregular and
   tended to be slightly vertically orientated. Spatial distributions of
   volumetric and gravimetric soil water content showed great similarity.}},

Abstract = {{The configuration of the southward-sloping water table under Yucca
   Mountain is dominated by an abrupt decline of 300 m over a distance of
   less than 2 km. This northeast-striking zone of large hydraulic gradient
   (of 0.15 or more) separates an area of moderate gradient (of about
   0.015) to the north from an area of very small gradient (0.0001) to the
   south. The position of the large gradient does not correlate well with
   any evident geologic feature in the upper 0.5 km of the mountain, but we
   suggest that buried geologic features are present that can explain all
   the geohydrologic observations.
   The three areas of differing hydraulic gradient under Yucca Mountain are
   parts of hydrogeologic domains that extend more than 70 km to the
   northeast. On a regional basis, the moderate and very small gradients
   generally correspond to areas underlain by exceptionally thick Tertiary
   volcanic sections and a highly transmissive Paleozoic carbonate aquifer,
   respectively. The regional large gradient and water-table decline are
   spatially associated with a contact in the Paleozoic rocks between
   clastic rocks and carbonates. This contact marks a large abrupt drop in
   the effective base of the hydrologic system because it is the upgradient
   boundary of the deep carbonate aquifer, which has a thickness of 5 km.
   An aeromagnetic high follows the regional-scale domain of large gradient
   under northern Yucca Mountain from outcrops of a magnetite-bearing
   clastic confining unit to the east, indicating that the regional
   correlation of the steep water-table decline with the upgradient
   boundary of the deep carbonate aquifer may extend to Yucca Mountain.
   Five additional features may be related to an explanation for the large
   hydraulic gradient: (1) anomalously low heat flow has been measured deep
   in the volcanic section south of the water-table decline, suggesting
   underflow of cool water in the deep carbonate aquifer; (2) the lower
   tuff sequence, of 0.5-1 km in thickness, which underlies most of Yucca
   Mountain, is largely replaced in the volcanic section by lavas in the
   area of the large gradient; (3) an analysis of the hydrogeology of the
   tuff section under Yucca Mountain indicates that transmissivity in the
   tuffs increases to the south; (4) a northeast-trending gravity low is
   present immediately south of the water-table decline; (5) units in the
   lower part of the volcanic section are 50-100\% thicker in the area of
   the gravity low than to the north and south. The abrupt stratigraphic
   thickening into the area of the gravity low indicates that the low
   represents a buried graben with its northern bounding fault centered
   beneath the abrupt water-table decline.
   These geologic features of the zone of large gradient under Yucca
   Mountain suggest two possible hydrogeologic models. First, the northern
   bounding fault of the buried graben may provide a highly permeable
   pathway (a drain) through the brittle lavas in the lower part of the
   volcanic section under northern Yucca Mountain. The drain would allow
   flow from the tuff aquifer north of the decline to be captured by the
   deep carbonate aquifer, resulting in the heat-flow low, the abrupt
   water-table decline, and the transition to a very small hydraulic
   gradient.  Alternatively, the northern bounding fault of the buried
   graben may be the effective northern limit of the tuff aquifer under
   Yucca Mountain because of the permeability in the tuffs north of the
   fault may have been diminished by hydrothermal alteration.  In this
   second model, the large gradient marks the point where the small
   southward flow of water through the altered volcanic rocks to the north
   abruptly drops into the tuff aquifer.
   In either case, heads in the tuff aquifer in the area of very small
   gradient may be regulated partly by upward flow from the deep carbonate
   aquifer.  This upward flow under southern Yucca Mountain is indicated by
   linear thermal highs along fault zones, by ground-water isotopic data
   suggesting inmixing of waters from the deep carbonate aquifer into the
   tuff aquifer, and by the upward hydraulic gradient found in a drill hole
   that penetrates the deep carbonate aquifer under southern Yucca
   Mountain.}},

Abstract = {{Evapotranspiration exceeds rainfall by a factor of three in the Okavango
   swamps of northern Botswana, yet saline surface water is rare. Brines
   develop in the groundwater beneath islands, however, and very strong
   lateral concentration gradients develop. These arise as a result of
   transpiration by trees which grow around the fringes of islands as well
   as by capillary evaporation of groundwater from the interior of islands.
   Precipitation of calcite and amorphous silica from the groundwater
   occurs beneath island fringes. Long-term monitoring of the water table
   and groundwater chemistry beneath an island in the seasonal swamps has
   revealed that groundwater rises and falls with the seasonal flood and
   that the saline groundwater remains centred beneath the island. The
   study shows that islands act as sinks for dissolved solids during
   intense evapotranspirational loss from the swamps.}},

Abstract = {{A geochemical study on 26 thermal springs and 5 samples from thermal
   wells (t > 20-degrees-C), 19 cold springs, 11 cold gas pools, and 14
   stream samples from the Tolfa and Sabatini Mountains volcanic district
   (about 1300 km2) has clarified their genesis and evolution. Meteoric
   waters infiltrate the more permeable exposed rocks (carbonates and/or
   volcanites) and percolate down into two main aquifers. One is deep and
   located in Mesozoic anhydritic-carbonate formations, and is the regional
   geothermal reservoir that feeds springs that emerge at the margins of
   the carbonate series (either exposed or barely covered); its waters
   display typical bicarbonate-sulfate alkaline earth composition. The
   other aquifer(s) is shallower, consisting of waters that circulate
   primarily in volcanic deposits. The chemical characteristics of these
   shallow waters are heavily influenced by lithology and by a gas phase,
   mainly CO2, originating at depth. Temperature estimates obtained with
   SiO2 and gas geothermometers, which seem to be the most reliable under
   these conditions, indicate the widespread occurrence of deep fluids at
   temperatures higher than 110-degrees-C under the area covered by the
   Sabatini volcanites. In some areas (Manziana, Trevignano, Nepi, and
   Cesano) the subsurface waters reach temperatures within the range
   characteristic of medium to high enthalpy systems (120-160-degrees-C).}},

Abstract = {{Electrical and magnetotelluric surveys have been performed on the
   Apulian carbonate platform to study the deep coastal karst aquifer. The
   surveys extend to a depth of about 7 km, to give a complete
   hydrogeological understanding of the area. The problems of interpreting
   regional geophysical data in highly heterogeneous carbonate rocks are
   extensively analyzed. This study suggests that the aquifer is generally
   confined at both the top and the bottom by more compact carbonate rocks
   and has a maximum depth of about 2 km. Also, seawater invasion is both
   areally and vertically limited. The possibility that dolomite rocks,
   present in the 2-5 km depth range, could also hold low-salinity waters
   is discussed. All the hydrogeological features of the investigated area
   are found to be mainly dependent on the tectonic evolution of the
   carbonate platform.}},

Abstract = {{Microlysimeters were used to measure dewfall over seven nights on a
   grazed grass and clover pasture in the Collie River basin in
   southwestern Australia. The Penman-Monteith combination equation was
   used over the same period to estimate potential condensation. Measured
   dewfall ranged between 0.002 and 0.100 mm night-1; the highest recorded
   dewfall rate was 0.032 mm h-1. Dewfall was shown to increase with
   pasture height and biomass. Potential condensation was between 0.20 and
   0.36 mm night-1. There was good agreement between measured and potential
   vapour flux trends. Low overnight wind speeds resulted in a low ratios
   of dewfall to distillation. The literature suggests that annual dewfall
   could be up to 12 mm and may occasionally contribute significantly to
   daily evaporation. However, these amounts are not significant when
   compared with the 694 mm average annual rainfall of the area. Hence
   dewfall is not considered to be a significant component of the water
   balance at this site.}},

Abstract = {{Neodymium, samarium, and dysprosium concentrations were determined in
   groundwaters along a transect of Lake Gilmore sediments from the
   shoreline toward the playa center with the future intention of employing
   the whole suite of rare earth elements (REE). Two different water bodies
   were identified in the groundwater/playa system based on the neodymium,
   samarium, and dysprosium concentrations and associated pH and salinity
   values. Shallow groundwaters that discharge along the playa margins had
   the highest concentrations of these elements and the lowest pH and
   salinity. A more saline entrained brine was identified toward the middle
   of the playa with higher pH values and the lowest observed
   concentrations of neodymium, samarium, and dysprosium. Groundwaters with
   transitional neodymium, samarium, and dysprosium values, pH, and
   salinity were also recorded along the transect. The data suggest that
   the acidic shallow groundwaters remove REE from the surrounding granitic
   rocks of the Yilgarn block and introduce them into the playa where they
   are removed from solution as the pH of the system increases. Evaporative
   concentration does not appear to have a significant effect on the REE
   concentrations in the Lake Gilmore system. Other factors such as
   increasing pH and scavenging of REE by iron oxyhydroxides which
   precipitate as pH rises appear to exert more control on REE
   concentrations in the groundwaters by removing them from solution.}},

Abstract = {{In the Saskatchewan River Basin, Canada (area: 365 00O km2), we compared
   methods of measuring total solutes concentrations, and assessed
   cross-channel and diurnal variation within sites, using data collected
   over 25 years at numerous sites throughout the basin. Regression
   analysis indicated that total solutes concentrations measured as the sum
   of major inorganic ions (TS(c)) could be reliably converted to
   concentrations measured by filtration (FR) or evaporation by FR =
   1.055(TS(c)). CoeffiCients of variation (CV) for multiple total solutes
   samples taken within 1 day at four sites were usually less than 5\% and
   always less than 10\%, suggesting that the daily mean concentration may
   be reliably estimated from a single sampling time. At 20 sites, C V of
   total solutes samples taken at points across the river channel were
   always less than 10\%, and were less than 5\% in 77\% of samples.
   Cross-channel variation was unaffected by solutes concentration (86-317
   mg l-1), discharge, time of year, or type of watercourse (prairie river
   or mountain stream). Statistical comparisons indicate that cross-channel
   variation in total solutes concentrations is unlikely to be significant
   except where tributary inflows have not yet mixed with flow in the main
   channel.}},

Abstract = {{Rising groundwater tables and increasing river salinities are major
   problems in the semi-arid Murray-Darling (M-D) Drainage Basin of SE
   Australia. Chemical data from precipitation, rivers and groundwaters are

   alteration of the hydrologic balance in the basin initiated during
   European settlement approximately 150 years ago. Our analysis indicates
   that about half of Cl deposition from the atmosphere in the western
   Murray Basin is derived from resuspended regional continental dust,
   resulting in high Ca/Na ratios in bulk precipitation samples. Estimates
   of recent marine deposition of Cl to the M-D Basin were made by
   excluding rainfall data from sites having high Ca/Na ratios. Basin-wide
   budgets for Cl delivery from the atmosphere and removal by rivers
   indicate that the Darling Basin retains about 90\% of current annual
   input of marine Cl whereas the River Murray exports two to three times
   current annual input to the Murray Basin (exclusive of the Darling).
   Some implications from this study are as follows: (1) Re-evaluation of
   net marine Cl input by rain implies that recent model calculations of
   Cl-36/Cl inputs from the atmosphere to the Murray Basin may differ
   significantly from actual values. In particular, net Cl-36/Cl input
   ratios from the atmosphere to the western Murray Basin may be a factor
   of two higher than those derived assuming all Cl in rain is of recent
   marine origin. (2) The very large inventories of salt within the two
   catchments, especially the saline groundwaters of the Murray Basin,
   accumulated over very long periods, probably of the order of a few
   million years. The current rearrangements of stored salinity as a
   result, at least in part, of human perturbations of the hydrologic
   balance are likely to continue for an extended period because of the
   massive quantities of salts involved, and thus present major limitations
   on options for long-term management of the M-D Basin.}},

Abstract = {{Middle Pennsylvanian fluvial sandstones in eastern Kentucky (Breathitt
   Group) manifest visible evidence of alteration related to fluid flow
   localized through near-vertical joints. Fracture-related alterations
   involve both physical and chemical modifications that together create
   dramatic permeability variations at the outcrop scale. On the fracture
   surface, infiltered detritus combined with mineral and organic coatings
   have reduced pore sizes and, hence, permeabilities (0.03-0.44 md) by an
   order of magnitude over values characteristic of the adjacent sandstone
   (0.32-1.53 md). Prominent zones of orange-brown discoloration contain
   evidence of oxidation reactions and form an envelope of variable
   thickness around the fractures. Authigenic iron oxides are not uniformly
   distributed within these zones, but rather are concentrated as local
   bands of pervasive mineralization commonly known as liesegang bands.
   Petrographic evidence suggests that most of the iron that now resides in
   oxidized authigenic phases was derived from solutes mobilized through
   dissolution of older iron-bearing authigenic minerals. Permeability and
   pore sizes within the oxidation zone are bimodal and vary from high
   values similar to those in adjacent unoxidized sandstone to low values,
   associated with the zones of pervasive mineralization, that approach
   those values observed for the fracture skin. The large magnitude of
   permeability variation around fracture systems in these sandstones
   documents the presence of a dual porosity system and suggests that fluid
   and contaminant transport cannot be realistically modeled using average
   rock properties.}},

Abstract = {{Large catchments usually exhibit seasonal flow variation. The Linear
   Perturbation Model (LPM) of Nash and Barsi (1983) is an efficient tool
   to utilise this source of information for hydrological modelling. This
   paper briefly reviews the development of the model and presents the
   results of application to some catchments within the Yangtze River
   (known as Changjiang in China) basin. The flow forecasts at the outlets
   of each catchment are made principally by routing flows observed further
   up the catchment. To simulate intervening area inflow from rainfall,
   both linear models and a two-parameter conceptual water balance model
   are tested. On the catchment above Hankou alone, at which the LPM
   accounts for more than 50\% of the residual variance of the simple
   linear model (SLM), the improved accuracy which could be obtained by
   allowing time variation of the LPM parameters has been studied and the
   results are presented. The paper concludes with the application of the
   LPM in real time forecasting mode.}},

Abstract = {{Not all groundwater flows, and traps that host stagnant groundwater may
   also occur, which are similar in nature to the better known traps of
   oil, gas and brine. Such traps are envisaged as mega-inclusions that are
   hydraulically isolated. They are under no hydrostatic head, as they are
   sealed from above and disconnected from recharge, but they are
   pressurized to various degrees by compaction. Hydraulic gradients based
   on data obtained from wells that belong to distinct aquifers that are
   hydraulically isolated from each other are false gradients. False
   hydraulic gradients applied in Darcian equations of flow velocity and
   water age lead to meaningless results (e.g. water ages that are too
   young).
   Criteria to establish hydraulic isolation of trapped groundwater include
   geological configuration (deep aquifer, engulfed by impermeable rocks),
   abrupt differences in water properties observed between adjacent wells
   (temperature, pressure, concentration of solutes, water age), and high
   groundwater ages (more than 10(7) years). The Great Artesian Basin,
   Australia, is discussed in some detail in the light of these guidelines,
   revealing a multitude of pressurized isolated aquifers. Calibration of
   groundwater dating methods based on hydraulic computations and isotopic
   methods (e.g. Cl-36 and He-4) is discussed for the Great Artesian Basin,
   with reference to the competing models of dynamic and static groundwater
   aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{A framework is presented for regional flood frequency analysis that is
   applicable for estimating extreme flow quantiles at ungauged catchments.
   The methodology uses the Region of Influence (ROI) approach to
   regionalization and explicitly incorporates a homogeneity test in the
   process of selecting the collection of stations that comprise the
   `region' for an ungauged site. The relative merits of the methodology
   are demonstrated through an application to extreme flow data for sites
   in Newfoundland, Canada. The new approach is compared with results
   obtained from regression analysis and is shown to provide improved
   estimates of extreme flow quantiles at sites which are considered to be
   ungauged.}},

Abstract = {{Two column breakthrough tests and a series of 88 batch-equilibrium
   isotherms were conducted to quantify adsorption parameters for the
   fluorescent dye Rhodamine WT (Acid Red 388), in contact with a Nicollet
   loam soil. Results from batch-equilibrium isotherms performed at a 2:1
   (water:soil) ratio showed that dye adsorption reached an equilibrium
   after 10 min on a shaker table. Regression equations were developed to
   predict distribution coefficients (K(d)) for Rhodamine WT (RWT)
   adsorption to the soil based on soil organic carbon and the ionic
   strength of the RWT solution. A linear isotherm fitted the
   batch-equilibrium data for RWT in the concentration range evaluated
   (25-8000 mug l-1).
   K(d) values obtained from the regression equation generated from the
   batch-equilibrium isotherms were input to a one-dimensional
   convection-dispersion model. The predicted results were compared with
   the experimental results obtained from two repacked column breakthrough
   curves. RWT adsorption was less than predicted in the first column (in
   which the breakthrough curve was terminated after 45 pore volumes), but
   greater than predicted for the second column (which was terminated after
   420 pore volumes). The reason for the discrepancy was attributed to the
   plateau-shaped breakthrough curve observed for RWT and differences in
   the ionic compositions of the two RWT solutions used to conduct the two
   column breakthrough curves. RWT did not appear to be a reliable adsorbed
   tracer if quantitative prediction is needed.
   Breakthrough curves for atrazine and trifluralin, two herbicides present
   in the second column, showed atrazine adsorption to be less and
   trifluralin absorption greater as compared with RWT, as was predicted
   from their respective organic carbon partitioning coefficients (K(oc)).}},

Abstract = {{The importance of incorporating nonuniform flow effects in determining
   field-scale values of longitudinal dispersivity from tracer tests in
   aquifers is illustrated. We show that under conditions of Fickian
   dispersive flux, where a tracer has traveled at least 10 times the
   longitudinal dispersivity value, nonuniform flow effects account for the
   typical tailing exhibited by data from radial flow and doublet
   (two-well) tracer tests. Approximate analytical solutions for solute
   transport in nonuniform flow fields based on earlier general work are
   presented. Specific cases evaluated include pulse and step inputs in
   diverging radial flow, a pulse input in converging radial flow, and
   doublet (two-well) tests with pulse and step inputs. The additional
   effect of longitudinal dispersivity increasing linearly with distance
   for radial flow cases is examined. Also presented is an analysis of the
   effect of injection borehole flushing represented by an exponentially
   decreasing tracer input in the converging radial flow case. The
   solutions are applied to four sets of field data where previous analyses
   did not adequately address nonuniform flow effects. Some data reanalyses
   yield longitudinal dispersivity values which are up to a factor of three
   smaller than those previously reported, indicating a previous
   overprediction of plume dilution. We demonstrate that an understanding
   of the sensitivity of the mathematical solutions to tracer input
   conditions, nonuniform flow effects, and scale can lead to better
   tracer-test design.}},

Abstract = {{A regional model is proposed for estimating the probability distribution
   of routed peak discharges. The model is composed of two parts: the
   distribution of the annual maxima of peak discharges Q(p) and the
   conditional joint distribution, given the peak discharge q(p), of three
   of the four parameters (peak discharge q(p), baseflow discharge q(b),
   storm runoff v and time to peak t(p)) assumed to represent a flood event
   hydrograph. The model is based on some simplifications and
   approximations. Analysis of the model behaviour in flood routing
   simulations, however, suggests that it may be considered reasonably
   accurate, at least in the range of accuracy accepted for design
   purposes.}},

Abstract = {{In west-central Florida, sections of the Upper Floridan aquifer system
   range in character from confined to leaky to unconfined. The confining
   unit is the Hawthorn Formation, a clay-rich sequence. The presence or
   absence of the Hawthorn Formation affects the geochemical evolution of
   the ground water in the Upper Floridan aquifer system. Mass-balance and
   mass-transfer models suggest that, in unconfined areas, the geochemical
   reactions are dolomite dissolution, ion exchange (Mg for Na, K), sulfate
   reduction, calcite dissolution, and CO2 exchange. In the areas in which
   the Hawthorn Formation is leaky, the evolution of the ground water is
   accounted for by ion exchange, sulfate reduction, calcite dissolution,
   and CO2 exchange. In the confined areas, no ion exchange and only
   limited sulfate reduction occur, and the chemical character of the
   ground water is consistent with dolomite and gypsum dissolution, calcite
   precipitation, and CO2 ingassing. The Hawthorn Formation acts both as a
   physical barrier to the transport Of CO2 and organic matter and as a
   source of ion-exchange sites, but the carbonate-mineral reactions are
   largely unaffected by the extent of confinement of the Upper Floridan
   aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{Stable isotopes (deltaH-2, deltaO-18 and deltaC-13) and radiocarbon
   (C-14) have been used in conjunction with chemical data to evaluate
   recharge mechanisms, groundwater residence time and palaeohydrology
   within the confined Dilwyn sand aquifer in the Gambier Embayment of the
   Otway Basin. This aquifer does not receive recharge down-gradient of the
   hydraulic hinge-line and data have been interpreted along two discrete
   flow lines. The mean residence time of groundwater (determined by C-14)
   in the confined aquifer from the hydraulic hinge position to the sea (a
   distance of about 50 km) along an inferred flow path is approximately
   12800 years. The corresponding hydraulic travel time calculated from
   Darcy's law is approximately 49 000 years. The apparent discrepancy may
   be a result of eustatic sea-level lowering during the last glacial.
   Because the groundwater system is hydraulically connected to the sea,
   lower sea-level would result in increased gradients and a decrease in
   groundwater residence time. Variations in stable isotopic composition
   along flow lines suggest a number of recharge mechanisms. Stable isotope
   data indicate progressive depletion     of H-2 and O-18 in the
   groundwaters over the past 30000 years. Groundwaters older than about
   10000 years B.P. were recharged either during a cooler climate climatic
   regime (lower precipitation/evapotranspiration and temperature) and/or
   the vapour source(s) had travelled over greater continental mass than
   those recharged over the past 10 000 years. Lower chloride
   concentrations in some of the older groundwaters indicate lower
   evapotranspiration rates in the recharge areas before 10 000 years ago.}},

Abstract = {{Different types of mixing cell models are analysed in detail. One type
   is found to be second-order accurate when reactions are not considered
   but reduces to first-order accuracy when a sorption reaction is taken
   into account. The second type is only first-order accurate even when a
   reaction is not considered. The most commonly used mixing cell model is
   extended to account for different surface boundary conditions, including
   that for a landfill. The exit conditions for a finite spatial domain
   were taken into consideration by making use of boundary layer
   corrections. It is found that the results obtained using the mixing cell
   model coupled with a non-linear isotherm are very accurate when compared
   with results obtained from a Crank-Nicolson scheme. It was observed that
   the accuracy of the results is dependent on the spatial step size. Best
   results are obtained when the spatial step size is close to twice the
   dispersivity. Application of the mixing cell model with a boundary layer
   correction was demonstrated by comparison with experimental data from a
   laboratory Na-Ca exchange experiment in which a solution containing Na
   was passed through a column filled with Ca-saturated loamy sand. The
   mixing cell model was also applied to breakthrough curves of two organic
   compounds (carbontetrachloride and tetrachloroethylene) observed in a
   field experiment conducted at Borden, Ontario, Canada. The mixing cell
   model described satisfactorily the Na transport in loamy sand and also
   the transport of organics in a Borden aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{Information on dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) concentrations and fluxes is presented for streams draining
   a matrix of acid moorland, conifer forested and harvested areas of
   Plynlimon, Mid-Wales. The results show six features. (1) pCO2 levels
   average 2.25 times the atmospheric value at 10(-3.15) for all the
   streams; excluding outlier points, 95\% of the data lie in the range
   0.2-5.4 times the atmospheric value. Although data scatter is high, the
   PCO2 levels tend to increase with decreasing pH. The flow-weighted pCO2
   levels average 2.5 times the atmospheric value at 10(-3.1). (2) Flow
   weighted average DIC and DOC concentrations are similar for all the main
   streams, at about 55.1 muM DIC l-1 (range 46.9-60.8) and at about 143
   muM DOC l-1 (range 121-159), respectively. (3) The DIC and DOC fluxes
   are similar for the main streams, at about 12.4 kg DIC ha-1 year-1
   (range 11.5-15.6) and at about 32.7 kg DOC ha-1 year-1 (range
   25.8-37.2), respectively. (4) DOC makes up about 72\% of the total
   dissolved carbon concentration/flux in the main streams, and
   undissociated carbonic acid contributes more than 87\% to the total DIC.
   (5) Deforestation leads to an increase in the DOC concentration and flux
   of about 29\%; this increase persists for several years after felling.
   (6) There is a statistically insignificant change in the concentration
   and flux for DIC, and pCO2, with deforestation. However, the main
   streams contain lower bicarbonate concentrations under baseflow
   conditions during and for the first few years after felling.}},

Abstract = {{A stochastic hydroclimatological model is developed to characterize
   areal droughts. Statistical properties of drought indices are described
   by conditioning monthly drought indices on large-scale atmospheric
   circulation patterns (CP). The methodology is applied to an area of
   about 110 000 km2 in eastern Nebraska, USA where the dry continental
   climate often produces severe droughts. In this example, the
   Bhalme-Mooley drought index (BMDI) illustrates the methodology. Five
   monthly classes of CP are derived using cluster analysis. Time series of
   BMDI are conditioned on monthly CP classes; BMDI is strongly related to
   these classes. A climate change may alter the structure of monthly CP
   classes; thus the impact of climate change on drought can be predicted.}},

Abstract = {{A coupled atmospheric-hydrological model is presented. Sequences of
   daily rainfall occurrence for the 20 year period 1971-1990 at sites in
   the British Isles are related to the Lamb's Weather Types (LWT) by using
   conditional probabilities. Time series of circulation patterns and hence
   rainfall were then generated using a Markov representation of matrices
   of transition probabilities between weather types. The resultant
   precipitation data were used as input to a semidistributed catchment
   model to simulate daily flows. The combined model successfully
   reproduced aspects of the daily weather, precipitation and flow regimes.
   A range of synoptic scenarios were further investigated with particular
   reference to low flows in the River Coln, UK. The modelling approach
   represents a means of translating general circulation model (GCM)
   climate change predictions at the macro-scale into hydrological concerns
   at the catchment scale.}},

Abstract = {{Flood deposits on the Virgin River in southern Utah and northern Arizona
   preserve a record of the magnitude and frequency of the largest natural
   floods that have occurred on the river since AD 900. In the Virgin River
   gorge, several of the natural paleoflood discharges were comparable
   with, or even greater than, the flood from a catastrophic dam failure in
   1989 that produced an estimated peak discharge of 1730 m3 s-1 in this
   reach of the Virgin River. To estimate the paleoflood discharges, the
   heights of slackwater flood deposits in the lower bedrock gorge of the
   Virgin River were compared with water-surface elevations calculated with
   the HEC-2 step-backwater hydraulic model. The timing of the paleofloods
   was determined by the ages of layers rich in human artifacts that are
   interbedded with the flood deposits. The estimates of both the 1989
   flood and the paleofloods were carried out in the Virgin RiveT gorge,
   about 60 km downstream of the dam break site. No natural floods of this
   magnitude have occurred within the relatively short period of the gaged
   record. This study illustrates how incorporating rare, extreme events
   from the long-term paleoflood record improves the database for flood
   frequency analysis. The 1989 flood serves as an analog to the effects of
   rare natural floods with similar magnitudes along the lower Virgin
   River.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional flood routing model (DAMBRK) is used to explore the
   influence of some channel and floodplain hydraulic and geometric
   properties on the frequency distribution of peak flood flow rates as
   flood waves propagate downstream. Peak flood inflows for selected return
   periods are derived from a known flood frequency distribution and the
   effects of channel and floodplain properties on the associated
   hydrographs and peak flow rates are examined as the floods propagate
   down a single river reach; geometric and hydraulic properties of the
   reach are varied over a wide range. With no lateral inflow to the reach,
   a one-to-one mapping of computed peak flows and return periods of the
   routed hydrographs is used to determine the flood frequency distribution
   at downstream locations. For an upstream peak flood flow regime defined
   by an extreme value type I distribution (EV I) with coefficient of
   variation 0.6, the form of the downstream peak flow distribution appears
   to change from EV I to either EV II or EV III whenever inundation of the
   floodplain occurs, and the peak flow distribution becomes less variable
   with the amount of reduction in variance depending on the effective
   storage of the floodplain-channel reach. The findings are important when
   selecting data for use in regional flood frequency estimation.}},

Abstract = {{Management of urban hydrological systems requires a knowledge of
   short-term and small-scale rainfall properties. Small catchment areas,
   dense building structures, a high degree of impermeable areas, and
   resulting rapid runoff, mean that the properties of individual rain
   cells are important considerations. Accordingly, this paper
   characterizes mainly spatial rainfall properties on a scale suitable for
   urban hydrology. Because of the usually dominant advective velocity
   component of individual rain cells the Eulerian view (observations of
   the moving rain cell by a fixed rain gage network) gives a distorted
   picture in the direction of movement of the actual rain cell. The extent
   of distortion depends on the magnitude of the advective velocity. The
   Lagrangian approach (moving along with the same speed and direction as
   the cell) gives different information regarding cell characteristics
   (e.g. size) compared with the Eulerian approach. It is shown that the
   Lagrangian cell size as indicated by the spatial correlation structure
   on average is twice the size of the Eulerian cell size. Thus, it is
   argued that the Lagrangian approach provides a more realistic picture of
   the rainfall structures compared with the Eulerian approach. The cell
   properties exhibit a temporal persistence of the spatial characteristics
   in the direction of movement. This persistence is, however, not strong
   and thus a forecasting procedure using advection only does not seem
   appropriate.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents some results of a study on the identification of
   flood formation processes and their modelling in the geographic context
   of the Swiss Plateau. With the help of hydrometric measurements at
   different scales, groundwater depth measurements or isotopic tracing
   (O-18), it is shown that all three processes mentioned in the literature
   (subsurface flow, and saturation excess and infiltration excess overland
   flow) occur in the Haute-Mentue catchment (12.5 km2). For heavier
   floods, however, overland flow predominates, with a proportion of new
   water in the flood rarely encountered in the literature. Under these
   conditions, the location of contributing areas, which is essential for a
   physically based model, proves to be difficult to determine. In
   particular, the use of a topographic ind'' is not entirely satisfactory.
   An attempt is made to show the difficulties in describing the complexity
   of the catchment's response to precipitation and, consequently, the
   limitations when deterministic physically based model are used.}},

Abstract = {{The daily rainfall-runoff model, MODHYDROLOG, has been used extensively
   in Australia to estimate runoff from rainfall and potential
   evapotranspiration data. This paper describes the application of
   MODHYDROLOG to 28 catchments throughout Australia with different
   climatic and physical characteristics. Four simulations are carried out
   on each catchment, the simulations differing in the numbers of model
   parameters optimized in the model calibration. The study indicates that
   the use of nine (or fewer) model parameters is sufficient to give
   adequate estimates of streamflow, and the use of four or five parameters
   may be sufficient in temperate catchments and in applications where only
   approximate estimates of runoff are required. MODHYDROLOG is purported
   to be `physically based' and this study also indicates that certain
   model parameters can be related to the catchment characteristics.
   However, it is difficult to estimate the values of some of the
   `important' parameters, and for this reason, MODHYDROLOG must always be
   calibrated in all modelling applications. Based on the general results
   from this study, recommendations are given in the Appendix to guide
   model users in optimizing and determining parameter values in
   MODHYDROLOG.}},

Abstract = {{The development and testing of coupled hydrological and chemical models
   for describing the impact of acid deposition on soil water and surface
   water chemistry are reviewed. Two problems fundamental to the modelling
   of environmental systems are identified. First, calibration data
   generally do not contain enough information uniquely to determine model
   parameters; this leads to an apparently good fit between observations
   and predictions, but provides only a weak test of the hypothesized
   processes. Second, state variables contained within the model are often
   difficult to relate to field observations, because of spatial
   heterogeneity or a `conceptual' model structure being imposed on the
   system. This difficulty can prevent application of the scientific method
   to model development. Within hydrochemistry, more testable and thus
   better posed models ran be built by using chemical signals to constrain
   the hydrological structure. More generally for environmental systems,
   the use of synthetic data analysis is suggested as a means to determine
   the minimal field observations necessary to identify the model
   parameters and to test the model. Still, given the measurements that can
   be performed, there may be fundamental limitations to the modelling of
   environmental systems that cannot be overcome. Probing such questions is
   vital to the future of environmental modelling.}},

Abstract = {{Problems encountered in field applications of water tracing dyes include
   background fluorescence and interference between dyes, where the
   complexity of hydrological systems, particularly in karst areas, makes
   multiple dye tracing experiments desirable. The fluorescence of water
   tracing dyes may vary dramatically according to the pH of the water, and
   this property can be used to address these problems. The response of a
   number of commonly available water tracing dyes to pH is investigated;
   the distinctive curves provide a means of distinguishing between dyes,
   and between dyes and background fluorescence caused by algae. It is not
   necessary to reproduce the full pH response curve to utilize these
   properties. Recommendations are made in the use of pH buffering to
   improve sensitivity in detecting dyes, and for quantitative laboratory
   analysis. Buffering to a small number of predetermined pH values can be
   used effectively to distinguish both between dyes which fluoresce at the
   same wavelength, and between natural and induced fluorescence. It is
   particularly useful in the case of the green dyes, both for detection
   when there are high natural backgrounds and because it allows more than
   one green dye to be used simultaneously. If Rhodamine is used together
   with, for example, Fluorescein and Pyranine, triple dye tracing
   experiments can be executed.}},

Abstract = {{We address the problem of declining streamflows in interconnected
   stream-aquifer systems and explore possible management options to
   address the problem for two areas of central Kansas: the Arkansas River
   valley from Kinsley to Great Bend and the lower Rattlesnake
   Creek-Quivira National Wildlife Refuge area. The approach we followed
   implements, calibrates, and partially validates for the study areas a
   stream-aquifer numerical model combined with a parameter estimation
   package and sensitivity analysis. Hydrologic budgets for both
   predevelopment and developed conditions indicate significant differences
   in the hydrologic components of the study areas resulting from
   development. The predevelopment water budgets give an estimate of
   natural ground-water recharge, whereas the budgets for developed
   conditions give an estimate of induced recharge, indicating that major
   ground-water development changes the recharge-discharge regime of the
   model areas with time. Such stream-aquifer models serve to link proposed
   actions to hydrologic effects, as is clearly demonstrated by the effects
   of various management alternatives on the streamflows of the Arkansas
   River and Rattlesnake Creek. Thus we show that a possible means of
   restoring specified streamflows in the area is to implement protective

Abstract = {{The remediation of non-mobile non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) from the
   unsaturated zone involves a number of physical processes that may be
   functions of temperature. The coupled mechanism of soil moisture (liquid
   and vapour) and thermal energy transfer in a partially saturated porous
   medium has been investigated through the use of mathematical modelling.
   The physical flow processes involved in this analysis are liquid, vapour
   and adsorbed liquid flow, heat conduction, heat convection, latent heat
   and heat of wetting transfer. A mixed form of both the moisture and the
   thermal energy equations is utilized, ensuring a mass and energy
   conservative formulation. The Galerkin finite element method is employed
   for the spatial integration of the governing equations while temporal
   integration is achieved by a fully implicit finite difference method
   with a variable time-stepping scheme. The two-dimensional coupled
   equations of moisture and thermal energy flow are assembled through the
   use of a simultaneous solution approach, resulting in a non-linear
   system of equations which is linearized at each time-step using a full
   Newton-Raphson iteration scheme.
   The proposed model was tested on a variety of problems which verified
   that it was formulated properly. Simulation results indicate that
   transient temperature gradients affect the moisture velocity and water
   pressure fields, due mainly to viscosity effects on the hydraulic
   properties of the medium. The effects of pressure gradients on the
   temperature distribution are minimal, indicating that heat conduction is
   the dominant mechanism associated with thermal energy transport.
   This present study is a step toward the non-isothermal analysis of the
   transport of contaminant gases in the unsaturated zone and in the
   dissolution kinetics of residual organics which may lead to a better
   understanding of remedial actions that involve thermal processes.}},

Abstract = {{In the past, cloud-cover has been a major factor limiting the use of
   remote sensing for hydrological applications. Satellites such as ERS-1,
   which carry microwave sensors, can now achieve regular observation of
   the Earth's surface, even in the presence of thick cloud-cover. This
   offers new opportunities for the observation of hydrological change over
   time and for the quantification from space of hydrological variabilities
   which are very difficult to measure on the ground. This paper identifies
   three areas where remote sensing can be particularly useful for
   hydrological studies. These are, the siting of ground-based instruments,
   the measurement of catchment physical characteristics and the
   quantification of catchment variables, Application areas for microwave
   remote sensing are then classified as being either operationally
   feasible, near-operational or requiring development and/or
   multifrequency sensors. A range of satellite microwave sensors will be
   operational until the end of the century; their data will be underused
   unless hydrological models are designed to accept the type of spatially
   referenced information they produce.}},

Abstract = {{When water passes vertically through low-conductivity zones in aquifers,
   significant vertical head gradients occur. The importance of such
   gradients is identified in a study of the Bromsgrove Sandstone Aquifer
   Unit. A mathematical model incorporating the low-conductivity layers has
   been developed to explain the changed conditions from 1900, when there
   were extensive spring flows, to the present day, when deep boreholes
   intercept much of the groundwater flow. The mathematical model also
   helps in understanding the changing pumped drawdowns and water table
   elevations.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental removal of woody debris from a small, gravel-bed stream in
   a forested basin resulted in dramatic redistribution of bed sediment and
   changes in bed topography. Removal of debris changed the primary flow
   path, thereby altering the size and location of bars and pools and
   causing local bank erosion and channel widening. Marked bed adjustments
   occurred almost immediately following experimental treatment in May 1987
   and continued through to the end of the study period in 1991. Increased
   bed material mobility was attributable to destabilization of sediment
   storage sites by removal of debris but-tresses, elimination of
   low-energy, backwater environments related to debris, and an inferred
   increase in boundary shear stress resulting from the removal of
   debris-related flow resistance. In contrast to these changes, which
   favored sediment mobilization, deposition was favored by the elimination
   of debris-related scouring turbulence and by increased flow resistance
   from a developing sequence of alternate bars.
   A more regularly spaced sequence of alternate bars replaced the
   pretreatment bar sequence, whose location, size, and shape had been
   strongly influenced by large woody debris as well as by bank projections
   and channel curvature. Following initial readjustment of the stream bed
   during the first posttreatment year, loss of scouring turbulence and
   increased flow resistance from alternate bars resulted in deposition of
   approximately 44 m3 of sediment within the 96 m study reach. The loss of
   5.2 m3 to bank erosion left a net increase in sediment storage of 39 m3.
   Mean spacing of thalweg cross-overs and pools did not change measurably
   following debris removal, although variability of spacing between
   thalweg cross-overs tended to decrease with time as the location of bars
   stabilized. No consistent pattern of change in mean residual depth of
   pools or in distribution of depths occurred within the first 4 years
   following debris removal.}},

Abstract = {{Snowmelt recharge to shallow (less than 25 m) groundwater systems is the
   primary source of streamflow in many mountainous watersheds, but
   characteristics of these systems are not well understood. Response time
   between snowmelt, piezometers and streamflow in the Upper Sheep Creek
   Watershed within the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed differs
   drastically from year to year depending on the extent of recharge from
   snowmelt. This is believed to be caused by groundwater flow becoming
   confined during years with normal or above normal snowmelt recharge. A
   two-dimensional, variably saturated, groundwater model was applied to 3
   years of data to validate the computer model and to test the conceptual
   model of the basin. Groundwater response measured in piezometers was
   simulated quite accurately when a confining layer (observed in drilling
   logs) was included, but not when the confining layer was omitted.
   Simulation results give credence to the variably saturated groundwater
   model, support the conceptual model of the basin, and improve our
   understanding of the shallow groundwater system in this mountainous

Abstract = {{After a brief survey of the history and prehistory of the subject, the
   paper expounds the current theory, in terms of the `simultaneous'
   inflow/outflow convention, of the continuous-state stochastic reservoir
   in discrete lime, with strictly continuous independent and identically
   distributed inflows. The Moran-Prabhu integral equation is derived, and
   an iterative scheme for its numerical solution is developed. An
   equivalent scheme for the evaluation of the storage distribution is
   alternatively derived directly from the fundamental stochastic
   difference equations, without involving Moran's discontinuity-avoiding
   U-transformation and without invoking the integral equation. The first
   approximation demanded by the iterative scheme is, constructed from the
   storage distribution in an efficient version of the approximating
   discrete-state reservoir. (Two almost equally good versions are derived,
   one being the `divided interval' version.)
   The direct derivation of the iterative scheme has the virtue of being
   applicable to reservoirs with discontinuous inflow distributions, for
   which no relatively simple integral equation exists, and is here applied
   to an arid-climate inflow distribution with a probability concentration
   at the origin.
   The continuous and discontinuous inflow cases are illustrated with
   numerical examples, both of which exhibit rapid convergence. It is found
   that, depending on the details of the inflow distribution, the storage
   density can exhibit interesting discontinuities (in addition to those at
   the boundaries) and corners.}},

Abstract = {{The paleohydrology of mature sedimentary basins undergoing uplift and
   tilting, deposition, and erosion is studied by numerically modelling the
   flow of variable-density ground water. In regional how systems
   consisting of both shallow freshwater aquifers and deep saline aquifers,
   complex ground-water flow patterns can exist, when buoyancy forces
   dominate the hydraulic head gradients arising from topographic relief
   The relative magnitude of the two driving forces, hydraulic gradient and
   buoyancy, changes during the hydrodynamic development of a sedimentary
   basin that is undergoing topographic changes. The relationship between
   the two driving forces and their effect on flow and transport is studied
   through coupled flow and solute transport simulations using an idealized
   model scenario. Modelling shows that increases in recharge rates can
   rapidly change hydrodynamic conditions from buoyancy-dominated flow
   governed by variable density to gravity-driven flow governed by
   topography. Because the dissolved mass responds much slower to changes
   in hydrologic boundary condition than does fluid pressure, transient
   conditions occur whereby the solute distribution may not correspond to
   the simulated ground-water flow pattern.
   Hydrodynamic scenarios were examined in the Palo Duro basin, Texas,
   where observed fluid densities range between 1000 and 1150 kg m(-3). The
   Pale Duro basin was affected by Cenozoic uplift, deposition, and
   erosion, causing modifications in topography and major changes in
   regional hydrodynamics during the last 15 Myear. Although fluid
   pressures have largely equilibrated with topographic changes in the
   recent geologic past, the distribution of dissolved mass evolves over a
   much longer time, and the observed solute distribution in the basin, as
   suggested by the geochemistry of the deep basin brines, may represent
   some past state of the hydrodynamic system.
   Paleohydrologic simulations describe buoyancy-dominated flow phenomena
   in the recent geologic past, when the topographic relief across the
   basin was much lower than it is today. Prior to maximum basin uplift,
   simulated flow patterns in the deep aquifers are characterized by
   convection cells. In the western part of the basin, where fluid
   densities increase with depth, convection cells show clockwise fluid
   motion, restricting recharge of shallow ground water to the upper part
   of the deep aquifers. In the eastern part of the basin, where fluid
   densities decrease with depth, convection cells are characterized by
   counterclockwise fluid motion and reflect thermohaline convection. With
   enhanced recharge due to continued basin uplift and subsequent erosional
   events, buoyancy-dominated how phenomena diminish and the gravity-driven
   flow component arising from topographic relief becomes dominant. This
   study demonstrates that, although present ground-water flow circulation
   in the basin is not affected by the observed fluid densities,the flow
   pattern history during Cenozoic basin development is much more complex
   than that which would be expected from a gravity-driven flow
   conceptualization (assuming uniform fluid densities). More important,
   the model scenarios describe the interrelationship between geologic
   processes, regional hydrodynamics, and transport phenomena and its
   importance in explaining hydrologic and geochemical phenomena in
   sedimentary basins.}},

Abstract = {{Water content was determined gravimetrically and apparent dielectric
   constant was measured by time domain reflectometry (TDR) for a total of
   189 samples of soil from the plough layer and the subsoil at five Danish
   locations. The soil types ranged from a coarse sandy soil to a sandy
   clay loam. Water contents varied from air dry to near water saturation.
   Samples were packed at dry bulk densities around 1.35 x 10(3) or 1.55 x
   10(3) kg m(-3). A third-order polynomial relationship between the
   volumetric water content and the apparent dielectric constant was found
   suitable for calibration. The relationship differed from earlier
   results; the deviations could be explained partly by differences in
   texture. Inclusion of linear terms for dry bulk density, clay content
   and organic matter content in the calibration equation each yielded an
   improvement in the correlation; this improvement, although small
   compared with the uncertainties in the measured dielectric constant and
   in the gravimetrically determined water content, was statistically
   significant. Even after inclusion of density, clay and organic matter
   content in the calibration equation, statistically significant
   differences between the ten soil types remained; this suggests that
   rather complex interactions between the soil components affect the
   electric properties of the soil.}},

Abstract = {{In 3.5m x 5m field plots at three locations, the apparent dielectric
   constant was measured by time domain reflectometry (TDR) during a soil
   moisture drying period using probes installed vertically to depths of
   15, 30 and 60 cm. Gravimetric water contents were measured for
   comparison. The three soils investigated were a Jyndevad coarse sand
   (coarse sandy mixed, mesic Orthic Haplohumod), an Askov sandy loam
   (coarse loamy to fine loamy mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf) and a Ronhave
   sandy loam (loamy mixed, mesic calcareous Typic Agrudalf) having topsoil
   clay contents of 3, 11 and 14\%, respectively. A root mean square error
   analysis showed that the laboratory calibration method of the authors
   (described elsewhere) performed better than the generalised calibrations
   of earlier workers. The new calibrations exist in versions with and
   without inclusion of an effect of dry bulk density. No difference was
   found between the two variants.
   For the field plots, the standard deviation was higher for water
   contents determined by TDR than by gravimetry (0-15 cm depth). Moreover,
   the standard deviation increased with increasing clay content,
   particularly with respect to the TDR measurements. Standard deviations
   for volumetric water content determined by TDR were in the range
   0.005-0.023. The measuring depth (0-15, 0-30 and 0-60 cm) did not affect
   the variation of the TDR measurements in a consistent way.}},

Abstract = {{The movement of water and chemicals in soils is generally better
   described with multidimensional nonequilibrium models than with more
   commonly used one-dimensional and/or equilibrium models. This paper
   presents analytical solutions for non-equilibrium solute transport in
   semi-infinite porous media during steady unidirectional flow. The
   solutions can be used to model transport in porous media where the
   liquid phase consists of a mobile and an immobile region (physical
   non-equilibrium) or where solute sorption is governed by either an
   equilibrium or a first-order rate process (chemical non-equilibrium).
   The transport equation incorporates terms accounting for advection,
   dispersion, zero-order production, and first-order decay. General
   solutions were derived for the boundary, initial, and production value
   problems with the help of Laplace and Fourier transforms. A
   comprehensive set of specific solutions is presented using Dirac
   functions for the input and initial distribution, and/or Heaviside or
   exponential functions for the input, initial, and production profiles. A
   rectangular or circular inflow area was specified for the boundary value
   problem while for the initial and production value problems the
   respective initial and production profiles were located in
   parallelepipedal, cylindrical, or spherical regions of the soil.
   Solutions are given for both the volume-averaged or resident
   concentration as well as the flux-averaged or flowing concentration.
   Examples of concentration profiles versus time and position are
   presented for selected problems. Results show that the effects of
   non-equilibrium on three-dimensional transport are very similar to those
   for one-dimensional transport.}},

Abstract = {{A hydrogeochemical investigation of a small moorland catchment in
   Mid-Wales has determined the importance of chemical changes along
   stormflow pathways to stream water chemistry.
   Flow from a network of ephemeral, natural soil pipes was identified as a
   major source of solute-rich water to the stream during storm events.
   Water was sampled during five events, of different rainfall magnitudes
   and antecedent conditions. Samples were collected at several points
   within the pipe network, along the water pathway from a major pipe
   outlet to the head of the stream and within the stream channel.
   There were significant changes in the chemical composition of water
   along the flow pathways to the stream; antecedent conditions, size of
   event and season were important in determining the magnitude of these
   changes. Between the outlet of the main pipe and the stream channel,
   concentrations of Ca, Mg and Si increased, whereas concentrations of
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC), Fe, H+ and Al species decreased. The
   response of K and NO3-N Varied with season. Concentrations of Na, Cl and
   SO4 varied little along the pathway.
   The most significant change in chemical composition was the release of
   Ca and Mg and the associated consumption of Hf within the drift material
   at the head of the stream. This reaction has important consequences for
   the degree to which the stream is buffered against inputs of acidic pipe
   water and hence for the acidity of the stream water. Solutes whose
   concentration and speciation are controlled by pH are also affected.
   The results emphasize the significance of spatial variability within the
   catchment soils and the importance of chemical and biological reactions
   along water pathways in determining stream water chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the annual water balance within a catchment is still
   hampered by an insufficient understanding of winter conditions. The
   least known term of the winter water balance is evaporation -
   particularly that from intercepted snow. Methods to measure interception
   and evaporation are reviewed. Undisturbed meteorological conditions,
   high time resolution and continuous measurements of intercepted mass
   were taken as criteria for an ideal method. The ideal method should work
   during periods of melt and sublimation and above rough forest surfaces.
   None of the existing methods fulfils air the criteria. Most traditional
   hydrological methods to estimate winter-time evaporation, such as runoff
   and snow-course studies, non-weighing lysimeters, and precipitation and
   throughfall measurements, produce too little information to distinguish
   the causes of the observed changes. Among micrometeorological methods,
   only the eddy-correlation technique is suitable, and should be used in
   combination with interception measurements. Of the methods primarily
   designed to quantify interception, i.e. collection of intercepted snow,
   visual or photographic observations, displacement transducers, weighing
   of branches and trees and gamma-ray attenuation, only the last two yield
   continuous interception records. In combination with continuous
   measurements of throughfall and drip, these methods can be used to study
   the evaporation process. The gamma-ray method can be used to measure
   whole-canopy losses, whereas the other two methods deal only with losses
   from a branch or a single tree. The weighing-lysimeter technique
   produces the same information as the method of weighing a cut tree but
   employs a more complex set-up. The weighing-tree method combined with
   measurement of drip is one of the current methods that is most suitable
   for process studies. A new device for this purpose is presented, which
   differs from earlier designs by allowing a continuous weighing of drip
   in a tray of 2 m width placed around the tree. The tray was fastened to
   the tree with wires and was automatically raised and lowered, thus
   allowing continuous measurements of both intercepted mass (with the tray
   raised) and evaporated mass (with the tray lowered). A maximum
   evaporation rate of 0.3 mm h(-1) was recorded with this device on 22-23

Abstract = {{Hydrometric and stream chemistry measurements were made across a network
   of sites to identify the dominant flowpaths producing storm runoff in
   Walker Branch Watershed, a small forested catchment with deep soils
   overlying dolomitic bedrock in eastern Tennessee. Recession analysis of
   storm hydrographs and an end-member mixing analysis using Ca and SO4
   concentrations suggested that three subsurface flowpaths were important
   in streamflow generation during a storm in March 1991. The chemical
   end-member mixing analysis indicated that vadose zone, saturated soil
   zone, and bedrock zone flowpaths contributed to streamflow, but the
   contribution of each varied over space and time. Bedrock zone flow, with
   high concentrations of Ca and low concentrations of SO4, dominated
   during baseflow prior to the storm, and was more important at a lower
   stream site than an upper stream site. Vadose zone water, with low
   concentrations of Ca and high concentrations of SO4, dominated the
   stormflow response at both stream sites, but was more important at the
   upper site than the lower site. Water level observations from shallow
   and deep hillslope and ridgetop wells showed the development of
   transient, perched groundwater tables within the top several meters of
   soil. Large increases in streamflow generated via vadose zone and
   saturated soil zone flowpaths appeared to be dependent on development of
   these zones of perched saturation in the upper soil profile and the
   initiation oflateraI and vertical preferential flow.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic gradients between the water level of Little Pond, a small,
   tidally influenced coastal pond located on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and
   41 mini-piezometers located along the shores and in the sand layer
   underlying soft bottom sediments indicate that the flow of groundwater
   to the Pond is mainly concentrated along the western shore, within a
   nearshore sandy strip. Similar results are obtained from the
   distribution of salinity in shallow bottom sediments. The point
   measurements of groundwater head are translated to long-term values by
   approximating tidal movements to a sinusoid and using a simple
   mathematical model. Salinity depth profiles in the shore and bottom
   sandy sediments indicate at least occasional outflow of salt water to
   the ground, and suggest that a density-driven convection may play an
   important role in determining the direction of flow and the distribution
   of solutes. Salinity depth profiles in the soft sediments compared with
   the results of an advection-diffusion model indicate a locally strong
   upward flow of fresh groundwater. The model is also used to estimate
   long-term average velocities of groundwater flow within soft bottom
   sediments. This flow makes up only about 1\% of total groundwater
   inflow, but may be important for the exchange of solutes across the
   sediment-water interface. In 1989, groundwater contributed about 60\% of

Abstract = {{Selected techniques for estimating exceedance frequencies of annual
   maximum flood events at a gaged site are compared in this paper. Four
   tail probability estimators proposed by Hill (PT1), Hosking and Wallis
   (PT2) and by Breiman and Stone (ET and QT), and a variable kernel
   distribution function estimator (VK-C-AC) were compared for three
   situations - Gaussian data, skewed data (three-parameter gamma) and
   Gaussian mixture data. The performance of these estimators was compared
   with method of moment estimates of tail probabilities, using the
   Gaussian, Pearson Type III, and extreme value distributions. Since the
   results of the tail probability estimators (PT1, PT2, ET, QT) varied
   according to the situation, it is not easy to say which tail probability
   estimator is the best. However, the performance of the variable kernel
   estimator was relatively consistent across the estimation situations
   considered in terms of bias and r.m.s.e.}},

Abstract = {{I examined the effects of an early fall (8-10 September 1977) cold.front
   on eutrophic Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, during which `Lake Number' L(N)
   (dimensionless) attained a minimum 3 h value of 0.45, and remained below
   1.0 for a total of 39 h. The front accelerated heat transport downward
   through the main thermocline, resulting in hypolimnetic warming; the
   vertical eddy conductivity K(z) increased monotonically with depth from
   a minimum 0.8 m2 day-1 at 16 m to 1.9 m2 day-1 at 21 m. The front also
   affected significant lateral and vertical redistribution of three
   passive solute `tracers': phosphate (P), silicic acid (Si) and soluble
   reduced manganese (Mn2+). Lateral concentration gradients along
   isopycnals predating the storm were erased. For Mn, especially, the
   vertical redistribution within the hypolimnion agreed with modeled
   changes based on vertical gradients and the K(z) profile. Mn and P
   behaved quasi-conservatively within the anoxic hypolimnion (no net
   sources or sinks), but additional supplies of Si appeared in the
   hypolimnion (8.0 +/- 1.5 Mg m-3 day- 1). This rate over 4 days agreed
   with the mean rate of hypolimnetic Si accumulation over the 80 day
   interval preceding 7 September 1977 (8.7 mg m-3 day-1). These results
   corroborate other environmental evidence that Mn and P both enter Lake
   Mendota's hypolimnion mainly during the first half of the summer, prior
   to the onset of bulk hypolimnetic anoxia, whereas Si is released by
   hypolimnetic sediments continuing into the late summer.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic study of the chemical composition of snow, firn from a
   shallow core, surface ice and of meltwater samples collected from the
   Chhota Shigri glacier, Central Himalaya, is reported here. The average
   concentrations of Na and Cl in snow are 402 and 753 mug l-1
   respectively; whereas those in old surface ice are relatively low, 185
   mug l-1 and 375 mug l-1, respectively. The average Cl/Na weight ratio in
   these samples is almost-equal-to 1.9, quite similar to that in the sea
   salts suggesting that both Cl and Na are predominantly of marine origin.
   The concentrations of other major ions such as K, Mg, Ca, NO3 and SO4 in
   snow and ice samples are generally less than 1 mg l-1. The major ion
   concentrations, when normalized to Na, indicate that the abundances of K
   and Ca are dominated by terrestrial sources whereas Mg appears to have
   both marine and terrestrial sources. Based on the seasonal variations of
   Na and Cl concentrations observed in the ice core samples, an
   approximate accumulation rate at the core site has been estimated to be
   1.6 m year-1 (640 kg m-2  year-1).}},

   model is employed in modeling the average 10 day streamflow of the
   Tanshui River basin in Taiwan to deal with the extraordinary phenomena
   caused by typhoons and other serious abnormalities of the weather.
   Including five types of typhoons and one serious drought as the external
   factors, the model is capable of describing the special hydrological
   time series. The intervention model is applied to streamflow forecasting
   and synthesis at Sanhsia gaging station in the basin. Comparing with
   traditional autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) models, the
   intervention model greatly improves the forecasting technique and
   successfully captures the special pattern of the streamflow when
   typhoons invade. In addition, the model can be used effectively to
   synthesize streamflows.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrology as a science and a technology is examined, as are some of the
   myths on the role of forests in hydrology and water resources. The
   history of catchment area research is traced, in Europe, in the USA and
   in East Africa, with particular reference to forest hydrology and, in
   the earlier years, to water quantity rather than water quality. The
   importance of associating physical process studies with hydrological
   systems' investigations, to enhance understanding of why particular
   catchments behave as they do, is stressed. Recent advances in
   hydrochemistry have been exploited to elucidate water flow paths within
   experimental catchments. Stimulated by requirements for research into
   acidification of surface waters, research catchments have proved to be
   valuable outdoor laboratories from which a much improved understanding
   of the flow processes has been achieved. Conflicting claims about the
   impacts of forestry are described and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This work reviews the runoff generation process in forests. A survey of
   the delivery mechanisms of hillslope runoff and the difficulties of
   incorporating some of them in recent physically based models is
   considered. The research challenge in reconciling the results from
   recent stream hydrogeochemistry studies with the results from previous
   hillslope hydrometric experiments is also highlighted. `Physically
   based' runoff process models for application to forest land management
   problems are then summarised. The work concludes by proposing a new,
   intensive phase in experimental hydrology which should support the
   continued development of new algorithms in runoff process modelling.
   Particular attention should be given to tropical forests and the need
   for additional hillslope hydrology research to address the important
   issues associated with hillslope management and conversion.}},

Abstract = {{In the last two decades, the effects of forest management on streams,
   riparian zones, and floodplains have become of much interest. In
   general, there is agreement that such areas should be maintained in a
   state approximating naturalness, although it is recognised that
   definition of this state is usually difficult or impossible. A diversity
   of management effects has been recognised and, in some cases quantified.
   For upland catchments, issues particularly relate to direct disturbance
   of the zone, changes in the flow of woody debris into the stream, or
   disturbance to the environment by effects generated upstream or
   downstream. For many areas, a particularly important commercial aspect
   is the definition of a `stream', as this can impose many expensive and
   severe restrictions on management of the land. For large rivers, a
   common issue is the effect of river management on flooding forests. In
   each case, the issues are complex, information is difficult to collect,
   and there are fundamental difficulties in going from anecdotal
   observation to data. Currently, most information appears to be at a
   relatively local level, and there is a very inadequate knowledge base to
   give a more holistic overview, although the concept of `cumulative
   effects', with the effects accumulated over both space and time, has
   much potential value. There are many opportunities for work in this
   field.}},

Abstract = {{Water yields increased after logging by 150-250 mm per year in small
   catchments of moist old-growth eucalypt at Karuah in central New South
   Wales. The magnitude of this initial increase was directly related to
   the percentage of the catchment logged (29-79\%). Where substantial
   vegetation removal took place in less than 20\% of one catchment no
   increased water yield was observed. Water yields began to decline in all
   catchments 2-3 years after logging as regrowth eucalypts became
   established, and the rate of this decline was related to the mean
   stocking rate of eucalypt regeneration during the next 4 years. This
   water yield decline exceeded 250 mm in the sixth year after logging in
   the catchment with the highest stocking of regeneration and the highest
   regrowth basal area. Water yields in this catchment had declined to
   levels significantly below pre-logging levels by this time, supporting
   the notion that regrowth evapotranspiration had begun to exceed that of
   the old-growth forest. Patterns of declining water yield in the other
   catchments suggest that yields in some may also decline below
   pre-logging levels as regrowth evapotranspiration increases in line with
   increases in the basal area of the regrowth forest. Further study is
   required to determine the magnitude and duration of water yield
   reductions in these regrowth catchments, and to quantify the eucalypt
   growth rates and stand conditions responsible for the reductions.
   Nevertheless, these early results are consistent with water yield
   changes observed in mountain ash forest in Victoria, and support the
   concept of greater water use by a rapidly regenerating forest.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term changes in annual water yield are summarized and compared for
   11 catchment studies in the northeastern USA. Substantial increases in
   water yield of up to 350 mm year-1 were obtained in the first year by
   clearing forest vegetation and controlling regrowth with herbicides.
   Commercial clearcutting with natural regrowth resulted in initial
   increases in water yield of 110-250 mm year-1. This range in response
   was due to differences in precipitation and configuration of cuttings.
   Unless regrowth was controlled with herbicides, yield increases declined
   quickly after cutting, seldom persisting for more than 10 years.
   However, yield increases were readily extended over 20 years or more
   with intermediate cuttings and/or repeated control of regrowth with
   herbicides. Nearly all increases in water yield occur during the growing
   season as augmentation of baseflow. Changes in species composition after
   forest cutting on several study catchments eventually resulted in
   decreased water yields compared with those from uncut, control
   catchments. Results are discussed in terms of implications for surface
   water supplies, global climate change, nutrient cycling, hydrological
   modeling, and long-term research.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment in mountain ash forests in Melbourne's water supply
   catchments in south-east Australia investigated the impact on long-term
   water yield of reducing forest density. Fifty-four per cent of basal
   area was removed from a 17 ha catchment (Black Spur 1) by patch cutting,
   and the patches were regenerated with mountain ash. A 50\% reduction was
   implemented in Black Spur 3, an 8 ha catchment, through uniform
   thinning. Uniform thinning was shown to be more effective in enhancing
   streamflow than patch cutting. A streamflow increase of 25-30\% (130-150
   mm year-1) was observed after treatment in both catchments. Eleven years
   later, a treatment effect of 15\% was still evident in the selectively
   thinned catchment (Black Spur 3), but the effect had completely decayed
   in the patch cut catchment (Black Spur 1).
   Research by Melbourne Water has established that streamflow is
   significantly influenced by forest age. It is hypothesised that this
   relationship, and the observed decay after patch cutting in Black Spur
   1, is largely the result of variation in transpiration. To study the
   relationship between forest age and transpiration in detail, sap
   velocity was measured over two summers in four mountain ash plots using
   the heat-pulse method. The trees on these plots were 50, 90, 150 and 230
   years old. On days when measurements were made, the mean sap velocity
   was not significantly different in the 50-, 90- and 230-year-old stands,
   but was significantly smaller by 14\% in the 150-year-old stand.
   Overstorey sapwood area gradually decreased with plot age, and was 57\%
   lower in the 230-year-old plot than in the 50-year-old plot. When
   combined with the sap velocity measurements, these data indicated that
   over the six warmest months of the year, transpiration in the
   50-year-old plot was 190 mm more than in the 230-year-old plot. These
   results support a hypothesis that differences in streamflow between
   50-year-old and 230-year-old mountain ash forest can largely be
   accounted for by differences in transpiration. Further heat-pulse
   studies in young regrowth and in thinned and unthinned 1939 regrowth
   will be needed if the streamflow changes in Black Spur 1 and Black Spur
   3 are to be fully explained.}},

Abstract = {{The jarrah forest of south-western Australia produces little streamflow
   from moderate rainfall. Water yield from water supply catchments for
   Perth, Western Australia, are low, averaging 71 mm (7\% of annual
   rainfall). The low water yields are attributed to the large soil water
   storage available for continuous use by the forest vegetation. A number
   of water yield studies in south-western Australia have examined the
   impact on water yield of land use practices including clearing for
   agricultural development, forest harvesting and regeneration, forest
   thinning and bauxite mining. A permanent reduction in forest cover by
   clearing for agriculture led to permanent increases of water yield of
   approximately 28\% of annual rainfall in a high rainfall catchment.
   Thinning of a high rainfall catchment led to an increase in water yield
   of 20\% of annual rainfall. However, it is not clear for how long the
   increased water yield will persist. Forest harvesting and regeneration
   have led to water yield increases of 16\% of annual rainfall. The
   subsequent recovery of vegetation cover has led to water yields
   returning to pre-disturbance levels after an estimated 12-15 years.
   Bauxite mining of a high rainfall catchment led to a water yield
   increase of 8\% of annual rainfall, followed by a return to
   pre-disturbance water yield after 12 years. The magnitude of specific
   streamflow generation mechanisms in small catchments subject to forest
   disturbance vary considerably, typically in a number of distinct stages.
   The presence of a permanent groundwater discharge area was shown to be
   instrumental in determining the magnitude of the streamflow response
   after forest disturbance. The long-term prognosis for water yield from
   areas subject to forest thinning, harvesting and regeneration, and
   bauxite mining are uncertain, owing to the complex interrelationship
   between vegetation cover, tree height and age, and catchment
   evapotranspiration. Management of the forest for water yield needs to
   acknowledge this complexity and evaluate forest management strategies
   both at the large catchment scale and at long time-scales. The extensive
   network of small catchment experiments, regional studies, process
   studies and catchment modelling at both the small and large scale, which
   are carried out in the jarrah forest, are all considered as integral
   components of the research to develop these management strategies to
   optimise water yield from the jarrah forest, without forfeiting other
   forest values.}},

Abstract = {{The jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest on a small catchment was

   respectively, below the long-term average. Streamflow increased from
   0.5\% of rainfall (4.3 mm) before thinning to 7.6\% of rainfall (90 mm)
   9 years after thinning. Streamflow duration increased, with the largest
   increases in streamflow in the wet winter months of June-October. The
   deep groundwater level at a midslope location increased by 8 m and at a
   valley location by 4 m in the 8 years after thinning. There was no
   indication of a new equilibrium being reached for either streamflow or

Abstract = {{Streamflow and its storm-flow elements in four catchments were analyzed
   by the paired catchment method for a response to fire. Prior to burning
   two of the catchments were vegetated with over-mature fynbos (the
   indigenous scrub vegetation of the southwestern Cape, South Africa), one
   was afforested with Pinus radiata and the fourth with Eucalyptus
   fastigata. One of the fynbos catchments was burned in a prescribed fire
   in the late dry season. The other catchments burned in wildfires.
   Neither of the fynbos catchments showed a change in storm-flow. Annual
   total flow increases of around 16\% were in agreement with model
   predictions, being related to the reductions in transpiration and
   interception. The manner of streamflow generation appeared to have
   remained unaltered despite the presence of some water repellency in the
   soils and consequent overland flow on some steep midslope sites.
   The two timber plantation catchments experienced large and significant
   increases in storm-flows and soil losses, while total flow increased by
   12\% in the pine catchment and decreased marginally in the eucalypt
   catchment. The pattern of the storm-flow increases was similar in both
   cases. After fire, storm hydrographs were higher and steeper though
   their duration was little changed. The respective first year increases
   in the pine and eucalypt catchments were 290\% and 1110\% for peak
   discharge, 201\% and 92\% for quick-flow volume, and 242\% and 319\% for
   storm response ratio. These fire effects are considered to be due to
   changes in storm-flow generation consistent with an increased delivery
   of overland flow (surface runoff) to the stream channel. This was
   caused, in part, by reduced infiltration resulting from water repellency
   in the soils of the burned catchments. Overall the hydrological effects
   of fire are related to numerous interactive factors, including the
   degree of soil heating, the vegetation type and soil properties.}},

Abstract = {{Lumped catchment models spatially average hydrologic processes at the
   hillslope scale or larger. Typically they can only be calibrated to
   streamflow data, and judgements on the reliability of their predictions
   must be based upon the results of a split-sample test in which part of
   the streamflow record is used for calibration and the remainder reserved
   for an independent test of the model. However, it has been argued that
   such a split-sample test is not an adequate test of model structure or
   of the hypotheses upon which the model is based because the independent
   record is typically hydrologically similar to the calibration record,
   rendering the test an exercise in model interpolation. A stronger test
   of model structure would force the model to extrapolate beyond the range
   of conditions encountered in the calibration record. One way to achieve
   this is to select a catchment which undergoes a major land use change
   during the independent test period. The small-scale experiments of
   forest hydrology are particularly important in this regard because they
   typically provide high-quality data on the effects of radical land use
   changes. This study illustrates application of this modified
   split-sample approach for the Crotty Creek experimental catchment which
   underwent a 6 year strip thinning treatment that removed 42\% of its
   forest cover. Two lumped catchment models, the SDI and CATPRO models,
   were compared. To make use of the full rainfall and streamflow record it
   was necessary to modify these models to differentiate between the
   interception and evapotranspiration fluxes of the forest and the scrub
   communities which developed in the cleared strips. Both models were
   calibrated to the pre-treatment record during which there was 100\%
   forest cover. Only the scrub parameters were calibrated to the
   post-treatment record. It was found that the SDI model, even though it
   had been previously extensively tested, failed to predict adequately the
   high monthly flows that followed the strip thinning treatment, whereas
   the CATPRO model, using a different conceptualization of quickflow,
   provided a reasonably good description of monthly water yields before
   and after the strip thinning treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the two catchment studies reported here was to allow the
   effects on water quality of road use and maintenance to be separated
   from the effects of a logging operation. In the first project, known as
   the Myrtle experiment, two small catchments in an old-growth mountain
   ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forest were chosen for a paired catchment study
   of the effects on physical and chemical water quality (baseflow and
   stormflow) of logging under a strict code of practice and with no roads
   crossing runoff producing areas. In the second project, known as the
   Road 11 experiment, the effect on sediment production from unsealed
   forest roads of vehicle use and level of road maintenance was assessed.
   The Myrtle experiment showed that the harvesting and regeneration
   operation did not have a major impact on the stream physical or chemical
   water quality. Increases were detected in turbidity, iron and suspended
   solids at baseflows, but these were small in absolute terms and of
   similar magnitude to the measurement error. The stormflow data revealed
   no significant influence of the logging operation. The suspension of
   logging during wet weather, the protection of the runoff producing areas
   with buffer strips and the management of runoff from roads, snig tracks
   and log landing areas eliminated intrusion of contaminated runoff into
   the streams, thereby avoiding the adverse effects of logging. The Road
   11 study determined that annual sediment production from forest roads
   was in the range of 50-90 t of sediment per hectare of road surface per
   year, with approximately two-thirds being suspended sediment and
   one-third coarse material. The use of gravel reduced sediment
   production, provided a sufficient depth of material was used. Increasing
   the level of road maintenance with increasing traffic load controlled
   sediment production rates, but when maintenance was not increased,
   sediment production increased by approximately 40\%. The results
   indicate that by identifying the areas that produce runoff it is
   possible to prevent contaminated runoff reaching the streams. Roads, on
   the other hand, produce large quantities of sediment, even when well
   maintained, so careful consideration of their placement and management
   is paramount.}},

Abstract = {{Gravel-filled traps were buried in the beds of streams draining steep
   logged and unlogged catchments of the Dazzler Range in northern
   Tasmania, Australia, and removed after storm events, to assess
   infiltration of fine (less than 1 mm) material into the bed. All stream
   catchments were geomorphically similar, over similar altitude ranges and
   had moderately erodible sandy-clay soils on 25-35-degrees slopes. Study
   catchments were selected to control for aspect, logging treatment and
   coupe age. Fine sediment infiltration into the stream bed was assessed
   for 15 tributary ephemeral streams in logged areas and 11 streams in
   unlogged areas. The logged catchments had been clearfelled in three time
   periods - 1990-1991, 1988-1989 and 1986-1987 - all by skyline cable
   logging. Trap yield was also assessed in riffles of the perennial valley
   floor streams upstream and downstream of the junction of six logged and
   six unlogged tributaries and upstream and downstream of four old but
   actively used road crossings. Trap yield was significantly higher in
   logged than in unlogged ephemeral streams for size fractions ranging
   from less than 125 to 500 mum, by factors ranging from two to three, but
   not for sediment between 0.5 and 1.0 mm. Trap yield of organic sediment
   of less than 125 mum declined with time after logging and burning,
   whereas inorganic sediment yield showed no clear trend with coupe age.
   Trap yield of 0.5-1.0 mm organic sediment was also significantly
   enhanced by logging and by burning. Sediment yield of streams logged in
   1986-1987 was not significantly higher than for control streams, whereas
   inorganic sediment and 0.5-1.0 mm organic sediment yields were highest
   for recently burnt coupes. A significantly greater number of increases
   in trap yield occurred between riffle pairs of valley floor streams
   adjacent to junctions of logged tributaries, when compared with control
   riffle pairs. Logged tributary junctions were associated with an
   increase in the organic content of sediment. Road crossings were
   associated with large increases in infiltration in adjacent riffle
   pairs, 30-50 years after construction. Current forest practices do not
   protect ephemeral headwater streams from enhanced sediment inputs, the
   long-term significance of which is unknown. Recovery of sediment fluxes
   in these streams to background levels appears to take 5 years or longer.}},

Abstract = {{A whole-watershed manipulation project was begun on the Fernow
   Experimental Forest in West Virginia, USA, in 1987, with the objective
   of increasing understanding of the effects of acidic deposition on
   forest ecosystems. Two treatment watersheds (WS9 and WS3) and one
   control watershed (WS4) were included. Treatments were twice-ambient N
   and S deposition, applied via NH4SO4 fertilizer, with three applications
   per year. Three years of pretreatment data were collected and used for
   calibration. Stream water chemistry data collected during 3 years of
   treatment were evaluated. Stream water pH and electrical conductivity
   were not significantly affected by the elevated N and S inputs on either
   treatment watershed. On WS9, there were no statistically significant
   treatment effects on stream water export of Ca, SO4, or NO3. On WS3,
   however, stream export of both NO3 and Ca have increased as a result of
   acidification treatments. The implications of these results are
   discussed. Research is continuing so that the processes involved may be
   elucidated. In addition, effects on vegetation, aquatic invertebrates
   and amphibians also are being evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Three headwater source areas were identified within a strongly acidified
   forest catchment in the Llyn Brianne area of central Wales. Each
   received an aerial application of between 10 and 16 t ha-1 of limestone
   pellets (composed of powdered chalk, starch and bentonite) in November
   1988. The pH, calcium and aluminium levels within soil water and stream
   water were assessed at fortnightly intervals over a 3 year period to
   determine the impact of the treatment on drainage water acidity. The
   results demonstrated the importance of identifying the effective source
   areas within a catchment and treating these with a readily available
   form of powdered limestone. Treatment with a pelletised form was
   unsuccessful in eliminating periods of low pH and high aluminium
   concentrations within the headwaters of the forested catchment. This was
   attributed to the slow breakdown and dissolution of the limestone
   pellets under the forest canopy and the reduced importance of the
   surface runoff pathways owing to pre-afforestation cultivation and
   drainage, and soil drying by the forest crop.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of short-term flooding on soil water content and subsequent
   tree response were examined in a riparian Eucalyptus camaldulensis
   forest which was dissected by a series of shallow ephemeral channels,
   locally known as runners. Twelve isolated plots, each approximately 0.8
   ha, were established in three blocks of four treatments. One of the
   blocks was underlain by a moist, sandy aquifer 2-4 m below the surface.
   The four treatments were (1) flooding each spring; (2) flooding each
   summer; (3) flooding each spring plus each summer, (4) control (zero
   flooding). Depth of water percolation after a summer flooding varied
   from 1.3 to over 6 m below the surface. Horizontal movement away from
   the edge of the floodwater ranged from almost zero on some plots to at
   least 38 m. The extensive horizontal movement was confined within narrow
   aquifers which occurred under some plots. Trees in plots underlain by a
   shallow aquifer always had higher xylem pressure potential (XPP, MPa)
   than other trees, and flooding these plots increased XPP by a
   non-significant quantity (-0.14 MPa to -0.12 MPa). However, on the other
   plots, flooding resulted in a statistically significant increase in XPP
   from -0.45 to -0.10 MPa. The effect of flooding on XPP was evident for
   between 22.5 and 37.5 m from the floodwater. This was ascribed to root
   interception and some horizontal movement of water. Increased flood
   frequency from zero to one to two per year resulted in mean leaf areas
   of 11.0 cm2, 12.2 cm2  and 13.2 cm2, respectively. Trees in the runner,
   at 8 or at 38 m from the channels, had mean leaf areas of 12.9 cm2, 13.6
   cm2 and 9.9 cm2, respectively. The presence of shallow aquifers
   increased mean leaf area from 11.5 to 13.3 cm2. Increased flood
   frequency significantly increased relative growth rate of trees up to
   22.5 m from the edge of the floodwater. We conclude that short-term
   flooding of channels that occupied 15-20\% of the forest floor
   temporarily improved tree moisture status and this increased tree growth
   rate in up to 70\% of the forest.}},

Abstract = {{Discharge of saline groundwater from Eucalyptus forests on a semi-arid
   floodplain was directly determined by first measuring transpiration
   rates from the forests, and then partitioning the transpiration flux
   into groundwater discharge and soil water depletion. This partitioning
   was achieved by identifying the source of the transpired water with
   naturally occurring stable isotopes of water. Transpiration rates were
   low, being about 0.3 mm day-1 from three E. largiflorens sites and up to
   2 mm day-1 from an E. camaldulensis site. There was no significant
   variation in transpiration across seasons, indicating that transpiration
   was limited by environmental factors other than evaporative demand.
   Despite its salinity (electrical conductivities of 11-33 dS m-1), the
   groundwater was used by the forests at all sites and all times, and made
   up 100\% of transpiration in more than half of the measurements, and
   40-80\% in the remainder. There was some consistency in water uptake
   patterns. E. camaldulensis tended to take up shallow soil water and
   groundwater simultaneously, as did trees at one of the E. largiflorens
   sites. At the driest sampling time, however, groundwater was the only
   source of water for trees at both of these sites. Trees at the remaining
   two E. largiflorens sites generally relied solely on the groundwater.
   The tree water source results indicate that groundwater discharge fluxes
   were between 40 and 100\% of the transpiration fluxes at these sites.
   These groundwater discharge fluxes were small in terms of regional
   groundwater balances, but would be important in the salinisation of the
   soils. Additionally, uptake of water from the soil profile by the trees
   substantially increased groundwater discharge compared with discharge
   from the soils had they been bare of vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Dieback of native Eucalyptus largiflorens forests is an increasing
   problem on the floodplains of the lower River Murray, southern
   Australia. Salinisation of floodplain soils, as a result of the changed
   hydrological management of the River Murray, appears to be a primary
   cause of the dieback. Regulation of the River Murray has reduced the
   frequency of large flood events by a factor of approximately three and
   caused groundwater levels beneath floodplains to rise. The higher water
   tables have resulted in increased discharge of the naturally saline
   groundwater in the floodplains by evapotranspiration, and the
   decreased-incidence of large floods has reduced floodwater recharge and
   hence leaching of salt from floodplain soils. Use of soil physical
   properties for a range of floodplain soils, combined with measurements
   of groundwater discharge from bare and vegetated sites, suggests that
   the time-scale for complete soil salinisation can, at worst, be less
   than 20 years. Moreover, salt accumulation at most sites will continue
   to occur as the present flooding regime (of which there is limited scope
   for improvement) appears incapable of providing the leaching required to
   counteract accumulation. The analyses carried out here suggest that the
   `critical' water table depth (below which groundwater discharge is
   balanced or exceeded by floodwater recharge) needs to be increased by
   14-55\% (the more clayey the soil, the larger the increase) to prevent
   salt accumulation. Failure to implement schemes which lower the water
   tables beneath the floodplain may, in the long term, cause serious
   damage to these important riparian forests.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to determine whether the deltaC-13 levels in the
   foliage and twigs of four Eucalyptus grandis clones were related to
   their water use efficiency (WUE). This relationship has previously been
   demonstrated in a number of herbaceous species but not in mature trees.
   The study involved accurate measurements of tree trunk growth and water
   use over a period of 4 months, with subsequent isotopic analysis of
   mature foliage from the north and south side of the canopy, and young
   leaves from the top of the canopy.
   The water use efficiencies were found to vary from 5.97 X 10(-3) to 12.3
   x 10(-3) m3 m-3. Significant differences were observed between
   clonal-mean water use efficiencies averaged over six sampling periods.
   The average deltaC-13 of the mature and young foliage was found to be
   significantly correlated with WUE. However, the correlation was weak,
   suggesting that the relationship between delta-C-13 and WUE is more
   complex in trees than suggested in the literature on crop plants. It is
   suggested that differences between sample trees in carbon allocation and
   leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficits may account for the poor
   correlation between delta-C-13 and WUE in the four E. grandis clones
   studied.}},

Abstract = {{A brief review is given of the results of hydrological studies carried
   out in southern India on the effects of plantations of Eucalyptus and
   other fast growing exotic tree species on water resources, erosion and
   soil nutrients at sites of differing rainfall and soil depth in
   Karnataka. New results on the impacts of the plantations on
   raindrop-induced erosion and preliminary results from studies that are
   aimed at improving the water use efficiency of the plantations are also
   presented.
   The erosion studies indicate that soil detachment resulting from net
   rainfall beneath Eucalyptus camaldulensis will be greater than beneath
   Pinus caribaea but less than that beneath the indigenous species,
   Tectona grandis.
   The water use efficiency studies, which make use of a controlled
   environment facility, have confirmed that in the dry zone of southern
   India water availability is the principal limiting factor on growth
   although, when water is available, nutrient limitations become
   important. Removal of both water and nutrient stress results typically
   in a fivefold increase in volume growth for the first year of growth.}},

Abstract = {{Enclosure appears to be the only feasible way to examine the gas
   exchange of small groups of trees or to answer questions about the
   effects of increased atmospheric CO2 on the assimilation, evaporation
   and water use efficiency of forests. To be effective, enclosures must
   necessarily change the microclimate, but few studies have been made of
   the consequences. In this paper, the assimilation, evaporation and water
   use efficiency of a community of Eucalyptus trees inside a ventilated
   chamber are compared with the same attributes for the surrounding
   forest. Assimilation and evaporation for the chamber were measured by
   the depletion in CO2 and the enrichment in water vapour of air passing
   through the chamber. For the forest, assimilation and evaporation were
   determined by micrometeorological techniques based on the energy
   balance, and for CO2, additional chamber measurements of the soil
   efflux. Water use efficiencies were calculated as the ratio of mol CO2
   assimilated to mol water evaporated. There are some important
   microclimatic differences between chamber and forest: net radiation is
   reduced by about 30\% in the chamber, the vapour pressure deficit of the
   chamber air is lower, and the light climate there tends to be diffuse
   rather than direct. Despite these differences, evaporation rates for
   both chamber and forest were generally similar, perhaps due to
   compensating effects in the chamber from higher boundary layer
   conductances (because of greater ventilation rates) and higher stomatal
   conductances (because of increased humidity). However, assimilation
   rates and water use efficiencies were markedly different for the two
   communities in clear sky conditions, with higher values of both being
   recorded in the chamber for most of the daylight hours. Only on cloudy
   days, when the light climate was diffuse in both chamber and forest,
   were similar assimilation rates and water use efficiencies observed.
   This behaviour seems to be attributable in part to the light climate in
   the chamber being predominantly diffuse and that in the forest
   predominantly direct. Diffuse light enhances the photosynthesis of lower
   leaves in the canopy. This contention is supported by model calculations
   of canopy assimilation under diffuse and direct radiation which produced
   qualitatively the same light response functions as observed for chamber
   and forest. The study suggests that the use of chambers for exploring
   questions of forest productivity and water use efficiency must be
   circumspect. The act of enclosure, by itself, can change the daily water
   use efficiency of the tree community by as much as 50\%.}},

Abstract = {{The structure, capabilities and performance of a distributed parameter
   hydrologic model are described. The model, called Topog-Yield, permits a
   transient analysis of unsaturated-saturated flow and evapotranspiration
   to be performed across complex terrain using a one-dimensional
   framework. It is applied to a 0.32 km2 mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans)
   forest catchment in the central Victorian highlands, Australia. We
   compare observed and predicted daily runoff values for the site over a
   continuous 12 year period (1972-1983) when the catchment vegetation was
   in an undisturbed climax condition. All input parameter values were
   based on published or measured data, although some variables were
   adjusted within the range of known variability to yield a best fit
   between predicted and observed streamflow in the first year of
   simulation, 1972. Although the model was `calibrated' for the first
   year, all variables other than climatic inputs remained fixed for the
   following 11 years. Modelled and observed daily runoff values compare
   well throughout the period of simulation, despite a wide range of
   climatic conditions. When modelled daily runoff values were lumped on a
   monthly basis, the model was able to explain 87\% of the variation in
   observed monthly streamflows over the 12 year period. Modelled annual
   runoff was within +/-5\% of observed values for 6 of the 12 years of
   record. Annual runoff prediction errors exceeded +/-10\% of observed
   values in only 2 of the 12 years. By the end of the 12 year simulation,
   the model had over-predicted runoff by less than 5\%. Input data
   requirements and model results are discussed in the light of a
   preliminary sensitivity analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reviews the application of remote sensing to forest hydrology.
   After discussing the general advantages and disadvantages of satellite
   remote sensing, the estimation of precipitation, changes in soil
   moisture, runoff, radiation components, sensible heat flux, latent heat
   flux, soil heat flux, changes in energy storage in biomass, primary
   production and monitoring the extent, type and density of forests are
   reviewed. Finally, the paper looks forward to future developments and
   concludes that these are likely to come from the use of multitemporal
   data, combined analysis of different types of remotely sensed data and
   of remotely sensed and ground data, improved image analysis techniques
   and combining satellite data with models.}},

Abstract = {{Models for estimating the spatial distribution of radiation, thermal and
   hydrologic regimes in topographically complex forested catchments are
   presented. These models use topographic attributes derived from a
   grid-based digital elevation model (DEM) as the primary input data. The
   models are based on simplified representations of the underlying physics
   of the processes, but include the key factors that modulate system
   behaviour. They represent an attempt to relate pattern to process. Model
   SRAD is an approximate method for estimating the spatial distribution of
   global short-wave radiation, net long-wave radiation, net radiation and
   maximum, minimum and average temperature, and accounts for the effects
   of topographic shading. Model WET estimates spatially distributed soil
   water content and evapotranspiration and catchment runoff. SRAD and WET
   were applied to a 21.65 km2 forested area within the Brindabella Range
   in south-eastern Australia to illustrate the potential applications of
   the approach. A 20 m x 20 m grid DEM was developed for the area. The
   computed radiation fluxes are consistent with measurements made at
   Canberra. The computed average annual runoff conversion efficiency was
   18.6\%, which compares reasonably well with the annual runoff conversion
   efficiency of 17.6\% measured over an 11 year period on a 97.5 ha
   catchment located near the study area. The study area contains five main
   sub-alpine forest types, as well as a small area of exotics. The
   computed fluxes were used to characterize the fine-scale environmental
   heterogeneity and environmental domains of these forest types. Average
   minimum temperature in the coldest month (July) and annual net radiation
   were two environmental variables differentiating the occurrence of the
   three eucalypt species (Eucalyptus pauciflora, E. fastigata and E.
   delegatensis) investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Forested landscapes often show very well-pronounced heterogeneity in the
   factors that control evapotranspiration, runoff production and carbon
   assimilation at a variety of length scales. In hilly or mountainous
   environments, strong contrasts in net radiation, available soil water,
   soil structure and stand characteristics can produce a large variance in
   both the meteorological drivers and surface resistance to carbon and
   water exchange with the atmosphere over distances measured in tens of
   metres. Because of the strong nonlinearities characterizing the
   influence of the environmental variables on surface resistance
   (particularly available soil water), the parametrization of surface
   process models with mean values of the environmental variables and no
   distribution often leads to significant bias in areal average carbon and
   water flux. However, it is often not feasible to incorporate directly
   the full distribution and patterns of the landscape for regional-scale
   models. Continental- and subcontinental-scale vegetation data sets
   currently being collected by synoptic-level satellites (e.g. the
   Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer, AVHRR) do not capture the
   large proportion of landscape variability that exists below the
   resolution of the sensors. This paper explores the impacts of various
   landscape representation schemes that retain a range of detail in the
   description of land surface form and processes on simulated areal
   average evapotranspiration, runoff production and net carbon exchange
   with the atmosphere. Specific comparison is made of schemes that attempt
   to incorporate the topographic structure, soil and vegetation
   distributions of a region with schemes that sample the surface at levels
   similar to current coarse-resolution satellites. For strongly
   heterogeneous basins (mountainous topography), it is found that spatial
   variations in available soil water can have significant effects on areal
   averaged carbon and water flux rates, particularly under drying
   conditions, whereas the spatial variations in radiation, temperature and
   humidity over the terrain appear to have a lesser impact.}},

Abstract = {{Water issues on forest lands involve many human elements and needs that
   are not addressed by advanced physical and biological research and
   technology. Major gaps in our knowledge of important patterns of
   climate, soils, and terrain can be filled by relatively basic data
   collection and monitoring programs. Careful analysis of existing data
   and field experience also can reveal appropriate directions for
   management. A focus on problem-solving can direct research more
   effectively towards the resolution of key issues. Despite their impact,
   resource policies have widely varying scientific foundations.
   Policy-makers need sound processes for policy development, including
   timely technical input that is clear, objective, and related to
   socio-economic considerations. Resource polices should be consistent and
   include not only regulation, but also research, education, assistance,
   and incentives. Knowledge and sound policies still may not produce the
   desired on-the-ground actions, however, because of variable awareness,
   understanding, skill, or supervision in the field. Education and
   training programs are important not only for resource technicians, but
   also for contractors, operators, and other forest workers. Good
   planning, communication, and field coordination further insure that
   problems are avoided and new opportunities for effective actions are
   identified.}},

Abstract = {{Dry heathlands at La Calma (Montseny, NE Spain) are periodically burnt
   by shepherds to improve the pasture. The effects of such fires on water
   quality and on the output fluxes of dissolved and particulate material
   were studied by comparing an unburnt 6.3 ha catchment with a 10.1 ha
   catchment burnt in 1983 for which some pre-burn data exist. Additonal
   data from another 22.5 ha catchment bumt in 1982, without pre-burn
   information; were used. Burning increased mean annual streamflow by at
   least 36\% during the first 2 years after fire. Overland flow on bumt
   slopes had higher NO3- and K+ concentrations than that on unburnt
   slopes. Fire had little impact on streamwater chemistry; only slight but
   statistically significant increases in NO3- concentrations and in pH and
   decreases in K+ and in SO42- were found. As a result of the increased
   water yield, dissolved nutrient losses via streamflow increased by at
   least 36\% in the first 2 years after burning. Despite this increase,
   nutrient budgets calculated at one burnt catchment showed that, except
   for Na2+ and Mg2+, it received more dissolved nutrients from bulk
   deposition than it lost through stream-flow. Bed load transport, the
   dominant process of particulate matter export, remained low during the
   first 4 years after burning. Both bumt and unburnt catchments received
   much more particulate matter from bulk deposition than they lost through
   bed load transport. It is concluded that the studied prescribed burn of
   these dry heathlands had little effect on catchment outputs of dissolved
   and particulate material. Lack of change of streamwater chemistry after
   a complete burn of the heathland testifies to the efficiency of the
   retention by the soil of nutrients leached from the ash, and nutrient
   uptake by regrowing vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Natural radionuclide transport is used as an analogue to determine the
   likely fate of uranium mine effluent in a seasonal tropical river in
   northern Australia. Concentrations of alpha activity determined at
   regular intervals in both filtered and unfiltered water are presented
   from four sites along the sand-bed channel of the creek, and one site at
   the outfall of the 200 km2 flood plain. Annual mean radium isotope
   concentrations were also measured. It was found that transport by the
   creek was conservative, in that concentrations and Ra-226/Ra-228 ratios
   remained constant.  About 50\% of the creek load was associated with
   particulates. No particulate concentrations were detectable at the flood
   plain outfall. Alpha activity loads were calculated for the creek input
   and flood plain outfall. It is concluded that all the creek particulates
   were trapped by the flood plain, probably at the upstream end. A
   substantial fraction of the solute/colloidal load was also retained. A
   50\% decrease in the Ra-226/Ra-228 ratio between the input and outfall
   supports this conclusion. Systematic errors arising from sampling are
   considered by examining the Ra-226 concentrations in detail through a
   flood at one creek site, and it is concluded that such errors are
   negligible. Previous modelling had assumed that only 20\% of released
   activity would be retained on the flood plain. It is now recommended
   that complete retention should be assumed, with deposition occurring
   preferentially at the upstream end of the flood plain. This will have
   the effect of increasing the predicted radiation dose to members of the
   public by more than a factor of five.}},

Abstract = {{Three multiple well pumping tests were performed in low-permeability
   Wisconsin-age weathered glacial till in Iowa, USA. A radial flow model
   based on the Dupuit assumptions and a radial and vertical flow model
   were used to estimate flow parameters. A numerical solution to the
   Dupuit equation and an analytical solution to the Dupuit equation using
   Jacob's correction gave similar parameter estimates but both showed a
   trend of increasing hydraulic conductivity with distance from the pumped
   well. The trend most likely indicated a weakness in the modeling. When a
   radial and vertical flow model was used to estimate parameters, the
   trend disappeared though the parameter estimates were similar.
   The field site consisted of 15 fully penetrating observation wells
   fanning out in three rays from a central fully penetrating pumping well.
   Of the four parameters (K(r), K(z), S(y), and S(s)) estimated using the
   Neuman radial and vertical flow delayed yield model, K(z) varied the
   most between rays. The anisotropy ratio (K(z)/K(r)) varied from 0.05 to
   5 among the three rays. Representative parameter values for the till can
   be summarized: K(r) and K(z) are 4 x 10(-4) cm s-1, S(y) is 0.04, and
   S(s) is 6 x 10(-5) cm-1.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the role of needle ice processes in the bank erosion
   system of a site on the River Ilston, West Glamorgan, South Wales, UK.
   Bank retreat rates were monitored with erosion pins over a 2.25 year
   period. Concurrent detailed data were also obtained on river flow levels
   and ambient air and stream temperatures. Unique data on river bank
   thermal regimes are presented, along with rare information on the
   morphological properties and sediment yield characteristics of needle
   ice growths. Needle ice occurred even with mild freezing temperatures if
   sufficient bank moisture was present, with average growth rates of
   approximately 1 mm h-1. Bank material incorporation and mobilization
   within needle ice was significant:  sediment yields of up to 4.02 kg m-2
   of bank face were observed, and represented between 32\% and 43\% of
   total bank erosion recorded. Most sediment was incorporated within
   needle ice when growth became stressed (because of overrapid cooling
   and/or limited moisture supplies), which supports the models of Outcalt
   and Fukuda. Four mechanisms of direct needle ice sediment transport on
   river banks were identified: direct particle fall, sediment-laden
   rivulets, sliding failures, and toppling failures. However, the
   indirect, preparatory role of needle ice and frost disturbance of bank
   surfaces is also emphasized, and the enhanced fluvial erosion which
   takes place when bank materials have first been conditioned by
   frost-related processes is noted. Both indirect and direct effects are
   expressed in a simple conceptual model and a number of the important
   system linkages examined. Combinations of needle ice action and
   subsequent fluid entrainment of weakened bank material appear to be the
   dominant mechanism for bank erosion here. Pronounced and persistent
   erosional notches in the lower parts of the bank profile were observed,
   showing that, in winter, even single, low-magnitude, flow events can
   effect significant channel width adjustment here.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach in lumped rainfall-runoff modelling, called FDTF -
   ERUDHIT, has been developed over the last 10 years. Although still based
   on the concept of the unit hydrography (UH), it tries to cope with the
   drawbacks encountered with most of the identification techniques already
   proposed, which are briefly reviewed. The specific points retained are
   the simultaneous identification of the excess precipitation series and
   the first differenced transfer function or UH. Differencing the
   discharge series to avoid any arbitary technique of baseflow removal, as
   well as the absence of any assumption on the structure of the loss
   model, is also stressed. The algorithmic set-up as an alternate
   iterative converging process is described in detail, with the various
   options available. A worked example is provided on the Gardon d'Anduze
   watershed (550 km2), in the Mediterranean region of South-East France.
   The final discussion comments on the delicate problem of baseflow
   separation, common to many UH identification techniques. The paper
   stresses the improvements yielded by the new approach, although the
   limitations connected with the UH framework remain.}},

Volume = {{150}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{A conceptual streamflow model which accounts for glacial cover has been
   developed for the Lillooet River drainage basin in the southern Coast
   Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. Although the model draws heavily
   on commonly used modelling concepts, two innovations it introduces are
   an algorithm for allowing the characteristics of the glacial drainage
   system to vary seasonally and from year to year, and the use of observed
   equilibrium line altitudes for nearby glaciers to help remove ambiguity
   from the calibration of model parameters governing glacial accumulation
   and ablation.
   Model performance as measured by the Nash-Sutcliffe criterion compares
   reasonably with values reported for previous model applications in
   mountainous snow- and glacier-fed catchments. A major problem was the
   necessity of extrapolating valley-bottom temperatures to higher
   elevations. Because of deviations of the actual from the assumed lapse
   rate, rainfall at higher elevations was often incorrectly modelled as
   snowfall. As a consequence, the modelled streamflow did not respond to
   many autumn-winter rainstorms. As a further consequence of the
   misclassified precipitation, the precipitation gradient had to be
   incorrectly set to a lower value than appropriate in order not to
   overestimate the spring-summer snowmelt response.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of modeling in hydrogeologic investigations has been
   stressed in a number of studies. Since the applicability of any model is
   dependent on the type of need and availability of hydrogeological
   information, a parametric analysis is essential to determine its
   applicability. This paper presents the results of a parametric analysis
   conducted to evaluate the effect of data uncertainty on wellhead
   protection area (WHPA) delineation. The precision of aquifer parameter
   values is the most important factor in a WHPA delineation process in
   relation to the model itself. To demonstrate the effect of variable
   values in a wellfield, we tested modified version of time-related
   analytical groundwater flow concept using a RESSQC model, which is used
   for capture zone delineation and to delineate contaminant front for
   injection wells. The RESSQC model is a modified version of the RESSQ
   code which was initially designed to only delineate contaminant fronts
   for injection wells. Field measured aquifer parameters for a shallow
   aquifer were used in the analysis. The results indicate that great
   caution must be taken when aquifer parameters such as hydraulic
   gradient, thickness, transmissivity and porosity are being used for WHPA
   delineation, since over or under-protection of WHPA can jeopardize the
   public health. An extended aquifer test and installation of various
   observation wells in or near different lithologic and depth zones may
   increase reliability of parameter values.}},

Abstract = {{Initial soil water content just before a rainfall event is an input
   required for the calculation of a basin's water balance including
   infiltration and runoff. However, for most watersheds such information
   is not available because its evaluation involves a large amount of
   labor. The objective of this study is to describe a practical model with
   which to estimate time-dependent changes of a basins soil water content.
   It is further used for predicting runoff water yield when rainfall depth
   is the only known component of the water balance equation (WBE). Two
   distinct cases of the WBE are discussed: (1) a runoff-producing storm;
   (2) a storm without runoff. Runoff events from four watersheds in
   southern Arizona were measured throughout 8 to 17 years and analyzed in
   this study. Rainfall-runoff relationships are described in this model by
   an empirical quadratic regression equation which includes four
   parameters. They were estimated by an optimization subroutine which was
   used to determine the minimum difference between measured and modeled
   results. The optimized parameters enable simulations of the continuous
   dynamic change of an index of the soil water content as well as
   predictions of runoff depths. It was found that the predicted runoff
   agrees reasonably well with the observed runoff. The minimum coefficient
   of determination (r2) between the computed and actual runoff for the
   multi-annual data sets was 0.62 and the maximum 0.86. Runoff threshold
   value was found to be a function of the basin average soil texture. The
   lowest threshold was 4.6 mm for clay soil and the largest was 9.0 mm for
   sandy soil. Since direct soil water measurements were not taken, we
   interpreted the acceptable agreement between measured and predicted
   runoff as an indirect validation of the soil water model. It is
   concluded that the model could be useful for extending short records of
   simulated runoff on nearby ungaged watersheds in semi-arid regions.}},

Abstract = {{The pH of a forested stream draining acidic soils on calcareous till was
   measured at frequent intervals along its upper 3 km on several occasions
   covering a range of flows.
   The drainage ditches and stream headwaters had a pH close to 4.0
   whatever the flow rate. The pH of the main stream rose for the first 0.5
   km and remained fairly constant thereafter. This constant pH value was
   7.5, 6.0 and 5.5 for low, intermediate and high flow rates,
   respectively, but was about 4.9 on two occasions of high flow rate. In
   two tributaries the pH increased with distance downstream. The
   calcareous till was the major influence on stream chemistry except
   during floods when the acidic soil had a stronger influence.
   Correlations between pH and log(flow) ranged from -0.7 to -0.9 except at
   some points at the head of the stream which had weaker correlations.
   Flow rate exerted a small influence on pH (e.g. pH = 4.50 - 0.233
   log(flow)) near the head of the stream and a large influence on it (e.g.
   pH = 8.22 - 1.149 log(flow)) further down.
   The aluminium concentration of the stream water fell from 0.6 to 1.0 mg
   l-1 in the drainage ditches to less than 0.4 mg l-1 where the stream
   left the forest. The calcium ion concentration increased from less than
   5 mg l-1 in the ditches to around 10 mg l-1 where the stream exited. On
   one occasion of very high flow, however, calcium concentration remained
   around 4 mg l-1 along the sampled section of the stream.}},

Abstract = {{The Mahanadi river basin extends over an area of 1.42 x 10(5) km2 and
   discharges about 15.74 x 10(6) t of sediment to the Bay of Bengal. The
   geology of the basin is mostly characterised by Precambrian rocks of the
   Eastern Ghats, rocks associated with the Gondwana supercontinent and
   recent littoral deposits. Sampling was done to determine chemical
   erosion, physical erosion and sedimentation rate in the basin. Carbonate
   rock weathering is the dominant control on the chemical composition of
   the river water. There is a spatial and temporal variation in water and
   sediment flow. The chemical erosion rate for individual elements at
   different sites has been established. Sedimentation rate deter-mined by
   the Pb-210 isotope method in core samples gives rates of 5.08 to 20.39
   mm year-1. This high sedimentation rate is attributed to local
   anthropogenic activities carried out in the basin.}},

Abstract = {{The Dhuleil aquifer is located in the northwest of Jordan and represents
   a major groundwater resource for domestic and agricultural purposes. At
   present, there are more than 80 wells extracting water from basaltic or
   limestone formations. Long-term observations have indicated an increase
   in the groundwater salinity. Chemical analyses of water samples
   collected from seven wells over a minimum of 12 years have been employed
   to characterize and determine the cause(s) of increasing water salinity.
   The results show that the electrical conductivity of each well's water
   is linearly associated with Cl concentration. Slopes of such relations
   are almost identical for the basaltic well waters and, thus, reflect the
   influence of the geological formations on water chemistry. Increasing
   water salinity was mainly due to increasing Cl salts of Na, Ca, and Mg
   as indicated by the linear relation between the concentration factor of
   each cation (a given cation concentration divided by the reported
   minimum cation concentration) and that of the Cl anion. The SO4
   concentration factors for all well waters did not increase in harmony
   with these of Cl. The Cl fractional negative charge tended to increase
   to an average steady-state value of almost-equal-to 0.8 for all basaltic
   wells, irrespective of the variation in irrigation practices. These
   observations suggest that return flow of irrigation leachate was not the
   cause of the increasing water salinity. Alternatively, deterioration in
   water quality was hypothesized to be due to excessive pumpage which
   rendered the exhausted aquifer more susceptible to the limited rainwater
   infiltrating the natively saline parent materials. This conclusion is
   further supported by the results of chemical speciation which indicate
   that all well waters were always undersaturated with respect to gypsum
   (ion activity products of (Ca2+)(SO42-) were smaller than K(sp) of
   gypsum by more than one order of magnitude). In addition, all well
   waters were undersaturated with respect to caclite with only a few cases
   where the waters were in equilibrium with that solid phase. After 25
   years of irrigation, soil solution chemistry became similar to that of
   the DH-16 well water employed in irrigation.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a stochastic model, in which Poisson cluster
   processes represent the arrival of rain cells within a rainstorm, is
   assessed for hourly point rainfall data from Birmingham, UK. The
   Bartlett-Lewis Rectangular Pulse Model is extended to include random
   cell duration, and its performance is compared with that of the basic
   model analysed previously. Both models perform well in reproducing
   statistics of the rainfall depth distribution at different time-scales
   for individual months, but the randomised model also enables a good
   reproduction of the proportions of dry periods of different durations.
   Performance is improved by an optimisation method which addresses issues
   of parameter identification. However, some deficiencies remain with
   respect to extreme values. Finally, the seasonal variability of
   parameters is represented on a daily, rather than monthly basis, with
   comparable results.}},

Abstract = {{Transformation of variates is the conventional procedure for deriving a
   probability density function of a variate y when a probability density
   function of a variate x and a function y = f(x) are known. In this study
   the probability density functions p(x) and p(y) are assumed known and
   the transform is treated as a differential equation which is solved to
   yield an optimal variate transform function x = f(y). Specifically, p(x)
   is considered a sample probability density function and p(y) is the
   normal probability density function. The solution for x = f(y) thus
   provides an optimal normalization of the sample. Properties of the
   normal distribution can then be used for estimating confidence intervals
   of the mean and tolerance limits of outer values. Such estimates of risk
   and uncertainty, when de-transformed back to the sampled variate of
   interest, x, are valuable tools in hydrology and water resource and
   environmental protection analysis and planning. The numerical
   methodology for solving the differential equation is not specific to the
   particular problem, and can be extended to other situations and other

Abstract = {{The Coventry Groundwater Investigation has researched the sources and
   movement of chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents in the groundwater system
   underlying the Coventry region. The hydrogeological scene is set in this
   paper as a basis for the other aspects of the investigation which are
   reported in the other papers in this volume. The deep, intercalcated
   sandstones and mudstones of the Permo-Carboniferous which underly the
   study area, behave as a multilayer aquifer, although individual aquifer
   units are not regionally extensive. The sandstone units are fractured
   and behave as dual porosity aquifers, with rapid tracer movement in
   fractures and diffusion into the low-permeability but porous matrix. The
   water balance of the groundwater system has changed from natural
   conditions because of man's influence. Although direct recharge has been
   reduced by the impermeable surfaces of roads and towns, substantial
   extra recharge arises in the urban areas from leaking water mains.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater quality in the Coventry aquifer system was surveyed using
   the 42 accessible boreholes. Pollution by chlorinated hydrocarbon
   solvents (CHSs) is widespread in the urban area, with trichloroethene
   being the major pollutant. CHS pollution is closely associated with
   industrial land use, except for trichloromethane which appears to be
   linked to leakage of chlorinated water from water mains and sewers.
   Modelling studies suggest that most of the urban groundwater is already
   polluted by dissolved CHSs, and that natural flushing of the aquifer
   will take hundreds of years. Inorganic pollution has also occurred in
   the urban area, and is linked mainly to leakage from sewers, in contrast
   to most CHS pollution. Little, if any, degradation of CHSs is taking
   place in the aquifer, and pollution continues, the poor quality of
   Coventry groundwater will, therefore, persist for the foreseeable
   future.}},

Abstract = {{The migration in the Coventry sandstone aquifer system of aqueous
   solutions of various chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents (CHSs)
   (1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA), trichloroethylene (TCE) and
   tetrachloroethylene (TeCE)) was studied by means of percolation
   experiments with undisturbed rock cores. The retardation factor (Rf) was
   very low (always less than 2 for TCA, less than 3 for TCE and less than
   5 for TeCE). The Rf varied slightly according to the nature of the solid
   sample but could not be related to the solid organic carbon content. The
   solvent adsorption was always almost completely reversible and little
   affected by the percolation flow rate (0.08-0.56 m day-1). The CHS
   breakthrough curves were typical of non-equilibrium processes (caused by
   sorption by the solids and possibly by diffusion between mobile and
   immobile water). The Rf values obtained experimentally were much lower
   than those calculated from batch adsorption studies, showing that
   percolation experiments are necessary to evaluate the filtering
   properties of consolidated rocks. These results indicate that in the
   Coventry sandstone aquifer (relatively high vertical and, especially,
   lateral hydraulic conductivities), two-carbon CHS aqueous solutes should
   migrate readily with water with very little retardation.}},

Abstract = {{The sources and subsurface movement of chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents
   have been        investigated at an industrial site, as part of a wider
   study of groundwater pollution by these solvents in the area of Coventry
   (UK). This paper presents a description of the site and groundwater flow
   as a prelude to a second paper describing the distribution, transport
   and fate of pollutants. Both open boreholes and a single borehole
   incorporating a multilevel sampler were constructed, and pumping and
   tracer tests performed. The latter borehole was the most successful in
   defining hydraulic heads for individual aquifer units. The cyclic
   pumping of the production borehole was analysed using a computer model
   to gain hydraulic data for aquifer and aquitard units. The tracer test
   defined, qualitatively, the role played by matrix diffusion in solute
   transport within the dual porosity aquifer. It is concluded that
   horizontal groundwater flow is dominant along fissured, moderately
   permeable sandstone layers. The low permeabilities of mudstone layers
   maintain high vertical hydraulic gradients. Sorption of contaminants on
   to the aquifer matrix is likely to be low, owing to a low fraction of
   organic carbon. However, matrix diffusion will serve to attenuate peak
   concentrations of pollutants and stretch pollution pulses in time.}},

Abstract = {{A single industrial site has been investigated in detail to gain
   information on sources and movement of chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent
   (CHS) pollutants in groundwater under the industrialized city of
   Coventry in the UK. A soil gas survey identified the most polluted area
   of the site where two types of investigation borehole were drilled; open
   boreholes lined with plain and slotted casing, and a single dedicated
   borehole incorporating gas samplers and gas-driven water samplers.
   Specially designed sampling techniques using pumps and packers were
   employed to determine vertical pollution profiles in the open boreholes.
   Core material was collected for sorption and diffusion experiments. An
   assessment of field investigation procedures suggests that soil gas
   sampling is a useful method for reconnaissance surveying of pollution by
   volatile organic compounds, but the results reflect only shallow
   pollution in the vertical profile. Open boreholes were found not to be
   satisfactory for accurate groundwater profile sampling and dedicated
   boreholes are recommended for such studies. Many uncertainties are
   involved in such a study of solvent pollution owing to the limited
   number of boreholes drilled and the complex spatial and temporal
   variations of pollutants. Despite the limitations of the investigation,
   several useful conclusions are drawn concerning sources and movement of
   solvent pollution. The main pollution source at the site is identified
   as the solvent storage tanks and pollution has resulted from poor use
   practices. Vertical pollution profiles indicate that the downward
   migration of 1,1,1-trichloroethane is following that of trichloroethene,
   reflecting their history of use on the site. The overall quality of
   groundwater abstracted in the system is set to deteriorate, as high
   pollution loads, presently at shallow levels in the system penetrate
   deeper, little attenuated by sorption or degradation. Diffusion of
   pollutants between mobile fissure and immobile pore waters will result
   in poor quality groundwater under this site for the foreseeable future.
   This trend is expected to be reflected throughout the urban area as a
   whole, with most groundwaters falling below drinking water standards for
   CHSs.}},

Abstract = {{The broader implications of the Coventry Groundwater Investigation are
   discussed in this postscript. The complex interbedded sandstone and
   mudstone sequence under Coventry is seriously polluted by chlorinated
   hydrocarbon solvents. Investigations in such terrain will require much
   greater expenditure than was available for this project if they are to
   describe the distribution and movement of pollutants in enough detail to
   evaluate, quantitatively, options for aquifer clean-up. It is not
   realistic to consider clean-up of Coventry's groundwater at the present
   time because of the lack of detailed knowledge. It is probable, at least
   for the present, that clean-up is not feasible, because of
   hydrogeological constraints arising from the extreme variability of
   permeability in the system and an absence of operational techniques for
   clean-up. Stronger, more pro-active protection of groundwater is needed.
   A major recommendation for future investigations is a procedure to avoid
   open boreholes, which can allow pollution to penetrate deeper into the
   aquifer, and may confuse the results of sampling.}},

Abstract = {{Drainage through the root zone at 1.06 - (D1.06) and through the shallow
   vadose zone at 1.83 m (D1.83) was measured for three years on three
   monitoring sites on a 12 m x 12 m loamy glacial till experimental unit,
   under a crop rotation of wheat, sunflower, and soybean. Large local
   differences in D1.06 were caused by very small differences in land
   surface elevation (less than 3 cm) between measurement sites, rather
   than by variation in soil hydraulic properties. Microtopographic surface
   elevation differences caused water to concentrate in local sites of high
   surface infiltration activity. Water then drained through highly active
   sites to the water table (at about 4 m depth), redistributed laterally
   to positions underlying sites of lesser surface infiltration activity,
   and moved upward into vadose and soil zones. Capillary waters later
   redrained as the water table receded. Crop growth characteristics,
   including the nature and timing of canopy and root formation influenced
   the local recharge activity of local measurement sites.}},

Abstract = {{A combined transient flow and water budget (TFWB) method and accounting
   procedure was developed and used to measure and partition the components
   of recharge to a sand and gravel aquifer underlying about 6.0 m of
   glacial till overlain by a nearly level land surface. The TFWB procedure
   was used to evaluate and quantify the dynamic interaction between
   surface recharge, till water level (at 2-4 m), and water cycling within
   the soil and vadose zone. Site-specific recharge activity was highly
   dependent upon surface microtopography. However, the homogenizing effect
   of the water table, measured by capillary movement of water through the
   vadose and soil zone, substantially offset the effects of surface and
   soil spatial variability and allowed relatively uniform estimates of
   local recharge at individual measurement sites. Substantial internal
   cycling of water within the soil and vadose zone was caused by the
   interaction of surface infiltration variability and water redistribution
   at the water table, even for measurement sites having little direct
   surface recharge activity. Through internal cycling, a single volume of
   water originating at the surface frequently passed through more than one
   soil and vadose profile during the recharge process. By applying TFWB
   procedures for the full soil and vadose zone between the surface to the
   water table, good estimates of local recharge to the Carrington aquifer
   could be made for the experimental area using few measurement sites.}},

Abstract = {{The simulation of the transport of injected freshwater in a thin
   brackish aquifer, overlain and underlain by confining layers containing
   more saline water, is shown to be influenced by the choice of the
   finite-difference approximation method, the algorithm for representing
   vertical advective and dispersive fluxes, and the values assigned to
   parametric coefficients that specify the degree of vertical dispersion
   and molecular diffusion that occurs. Computed potable water recovery
   efficiencies will differ depending upon the choice of algorithm and
   approximation method, as will dispersion coefficients estimated based on
   the calibration of simulations to match measured data. A comparison of
   centered and backward finite-difference approximation methods shows that
   substantially different transition zones between injected and native
   waters are depicted by the different methods, and computed recovery
   efficiencies vary greatly. Standard and experimental algorithms and a
   variety of values for molecular diffusivity, transverse dispersivity,
   and vertical scaling factor were compared in simulations of freshwater
   storage in a thin brackish aquifer. Computed recovery efficiencies vary
   considerably, and appreciable differences are observed in the
   distribution of injected freshwater in the various cases tested. The
   results demonstrate both a qualitatively different description of
   transport using the experimental algorithms and the interrelated
   influences of molecular diffusion and transverse dispersion on simulated
   recovery efficiency. When simulating natural aquifer flow in
   cross-section, flushing of the aquifer occurred for all tested
   coefficient choices using both standard and experimental algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The time domain reflectometry (TDR) technique was evaluated as a viable
   method for quick and accurate characterization of the solute transport
   parameters in controlled laboratory conditions. The method is able to

   columns. Transport of a solute was monitored in a column uniformly
   packed with a disturbed sandy material and columns filled with
   undisturbed soil material of three different soil horizons of a sandy
   soil profile. The measured solute breakthrough curves were used to
   assess the parameters of the classical two-parameter convection
   dispersion equation (CDE), in which it is assumed that the solute is
   completely miscible. Alternatively, a four-parameter two-region model
   was fitted to the data, assuming exchange between immobile and mobile
   water. The study reveals that transport of solutes in undisturbed sandy
   soil is much better described using the two-region model. In addition,
   it has been shown that the apparent dispersion coefficient of the CDE
   could be linearly related to the solute pore water velocity.}},

Abstract = {{Physically based hydrological models require values of saturated and
   unsaturated hydraulic conductivity to solve the equations used to
   describe subsurface flow. Variability of these    parameters within and
   between various land uses and soil types is an important consideration
   if hydrological behaviour is to be described realistically.
   A catchment in south-west England has been chosen to validate the
   European Hydrological System (Systeme Hydrologique Europeen - SHE). The
   catchment includes three land use domains - arable (including temporary
   grass), permanent grassland and woodland. For the unsaturated zone
   component of the SHE both saturated hydraulic conductivity, K(s), and
   unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as a function of matric suction,
   K(psi), are required. The aim of this investigation was to measure the
   parameters for input to the model, to assess the variability of these
   parameters and to determine whether or not parameters should be used for
   each domain independently. A Guelph permeameter was used to obtain K(s)
   and alpha, which describes the slope of the logarithmic unsaturated
   hydraulic conductivity function (K(psi) = K(s) exp(alphapsi)).
   Measurements at four depths were carried out. Domains were chosen
   according to land use - arable land (including temporary grass),
   permanent grassland and woodland. Both K(s) and alpha were found to be
   log-normally distributed. The K(s) values were highest in the grassland
   and lowest in arable land. The difference between means was significant
   for K(s) but not for alpha in the three domains. High values of K(s)
   were attributed to preferential flow along slate faces and root-induced
   channels in the grassland and woodland, respectively, as indicated by
   dye tests. Finally, it was concluded that, as K(s) and K(psi) differ
   significantly between domains, different hydrological behaviour would be
   expected. It is therefore recommended that different parameter sets be
   used for modelling the individual domains.}},

Abstract = {{Two methods to estimate the saturated and unsaturated hydraulic
   conductivity of soil were compared in a catchment in south-west England.
   The catchment consists of three land use domains - arable, permanent
   grass and woodland. The methods used were in situ measurements using a
   Guelph permeameter and the predictive model of Rawls and Brakensiek,
   which uses percentage of sand, percentage of clay and porosity as input.
   In grassland and woodland no significant differences were found between
   the mean saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity estimated by
   the two methods. It is suggested that a significant difference found for
   the arable land is due to the effect of farming operations on soil
   permeability. On a catchment scale there were no significant differences
   between the methods. The results obtained using the predictive model are
   encouraging and worth further investigation. The advantages and
   disadvantages of the two methods are evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Water flow in structured clay soils is strongly influenced by the
   presence and geometry of macropores. This study was conducted to develop
   a method that could measure bypass flow, provide a morphological
   analysis of the water-conducting macropore system, and combine physical
   and morphological data in a simulation model for prediction purposes.
   The effects of different physical boundary conditions on bypass flow,
   such as rain intensity, the conductivity of the soil, soil microrelief
   and initial pressure head in the soil, were tested with a
   computer-controlled measuring device. Measurements were carried out on
   large undisturbed soil cylinders in the laboratory. Macropore geometry
   was subsequently characterized by using fractal dimensions of staining
   patterns on horizontal cross-sections and was a very important parameter
   to explain the measured outflow. A pedotransfer function, based on this
   geometry, was used to calculate the time of initial breakthrough at the
   bottom of the soil cylinders. This pedotransfer function was then used
   in a computer model which simulated bypass flow successfully in 15 large
   soil columns. The total amount of outflow was not directly influenced by
   rain intensity but more by the amount of rain applied.}},

Abstract = {{Four major storms occurring on a 7.4 km2 Pennsylvania watershed during
   May-June 1990 were used to examine methods for isotopically separating
   surface and subsurface stormflow components when the O-18 variability in
   rainfall is known. Rainfalls and the resulting stormflows were
   incrementally sampled and analyzed for O-18, Si, Na, Cl, Mg, and NO3.
   Compared with conventionally used methods that input rainfall as a
   whole-storm value, analysis of the O-18 data by peak rainfall periods
   rather than by total storm changed the separations the most. In
   contrast, substituting incremental for total-storm averaging of rainfall
   O-18 input caused much less change. When the peak and incremental
   averaging approaches for O-18 were combined into a single method, the
   O-18-based separations corresponded to the silica-based separations for
   all storms and Na-based separations for the largest storms. The
   peak-based methods estimate subsurface contributions to stormflow to be
   substantially larger than would be estimated by conventionally used
   total-storm methods.}},

   Within each technique, estimates of hydraulic conductivity showed no
   difference. Comparison of hydraulic conductivity estimates between
   techniques (slug test vs. pressure test) showed differences due to
   stratigraphy. The interval tested using slug tests crossed two
   stratigraphic units; the pressure system tested only one of these units.
   We conclude that the pressure system may be used to characterize the
   vertical hydraulic conductivity distribution in a series of successive
   tests by changing the packer position and the screened interval tested.}},

Abstract = {{The groundwater recharge rate was determined by using the change in soil
   temperature, beneath two densities of pine plantation on a sandy soil in
   a region with a Mediterranean climate, in Western Australia. According
   to the numerical analysis, with different patterns of water flux and
   with the same volume of applied water, it was found that the groundwater
   recharge rate could be estimated using the `relative soil temperature
   difference method'. The method may be applied when annual recharge is
   low and temperature measurements are available within the top few
   metres. Using the annual change in soil temperature at 1.5 and 2.0 m
   depths, the ratio of estimated recharge rate at the sparse pine site to
   that at the dense pine site was about 1.98. Recharge rates so determined
   correspond closely to those estimated by tracer methods using natural
   chloride and artificial bromide. The heat balance method, involving
   change in the heat capacity of the soil after rainfall events, can
   estimate the water flux only near the surface; it cannot determine water
   flux at greater depths because the change in soil temperature caused by
   rainfall events can be detected only down to a metre or so.}},

Title = {{GEOCHEMICAL EVIDENCE FOR GROUNDWATER BEHAVIOR IN AN UNCONFINED AQUIFER,

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{148}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{249-272}},

Abstract = {{Five well sites have been investigated along an east-west transect
   across the surfical aquifer system (SAS) of south Florida. Differences
   between rainfall during wet seasons (June-October) and evaporation
   during dry seasons (November-May) give surface waters of this region
   isotopically light (deltaO-18 - 22 parts per thousand and deltaD - 7.6
   parts per thousand) and heavy (deltaO-18 + 4.2 parts per thousand)
   compositions, respectively. Surface waters and shallow groundwaters are
   enriched in O-18 and D to the west, which is consistent with westward
   decrease in equal excess of rainfall. In the shallow portion of the SAS
   (less than 20 m, Biscayne sub-aquifer) heterogeneous stable isotopic
   compositions occur over short spans of time (less than 90 days),
   reflecting seasonal changes in the isotopic composition of recharge and
   rapid flushing. Homogeneous stable isotopic compositions occur below the
   Biscayne sub-aquifer, marking the zone of delayed circulation.
   Surface evaporation calculated from a stable isotope evaporation model
   agrees with previously published estimates of 75-95\% by physical
   evaporation measurements and water budget calculations. This model
   contains many parameters that are assumed to be mean values, but
   short-term variability in some of these parameters may make this model
   unsuitable for the application of yearly mean values. For the
   Everglades, changes in the isotopic composition of atmospheric vapor
   during the dry season may cause the model to yield anomalous results
   when annual mean values are used.
   Chloride-enriched waters (more than 280 mg l-1) form a plume emanating
   from the bottom central portion of the transect. Elevated chloride
   concentration and light stable isotopic composition (deltaO-18
   almost-equal-to - 2 parts per thousand, deltaD almost-equal-to - 8 parts
   per thousand) suggest this plume is probably caused not by salinity of
   residual seawater in the aquifer, but by leakage from the minor artesian
   water-bearing zone of the Floridan aquifer system.
   Stable isotope values from Floridan aquifer groundwater plot close to
   the meteoric water line, in the same area as Everglades rainfall. These
   Floridan waters are interpreted to have originated in central Florida
   some 25 000 - 132 000 years ago, indicating that meteoric conditions in
   the Florida peninsula have changed little since late Pleistocene time.}},

   can provide satisfactory estimates of monthly and annual catchment
   yields in almost all catchments. However, the time-series approaches and
   the simple conceptual model can also provide adequate estimates of
   monthly and annual yields in the wetter catchments. As it is much easier
   to use these approaches than the complex conceptual model, the simpler

Abstract = {{Hydrometric measurements and geochemical hydrograph separation
   techniques were used in experimental plots to determine the processes
   that govern stormflow production in a forested swamp situated in a
   regional groundwater discharge zone. Hydrometric measurements suggested
   that saturated overland flow from permanently saturated areas created by
   discharging groundwater was the major storm runoff mechanism. Chemical
   separation analysis, using a portable irrigation system, indicated that
   over 70\% of the runoff was pre-event water.
   Groundwater ridging did not contribute significantly to wetland runoff,
   whereas preferential flow through pipes accounted for a minor component
   of the pre-event water at peak streamflow and the majority of the
   pre-event flow in the recession. Rapid mixing of event water with a
   significantly larger pool of pre-event water standing in the saturated
   areas is responsible for the rapid appearance of the pre-event water in
   surface generated stormflow. The rapid groundwater-surface water mixing
   in the saturated areas has implications for the interpretation of runoff
   mechanisms based solely on chemical separation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses aspects of the calculation of likelihood-based
   confidence intervals for T-year floods, with particular reference to (1)
   the two-parameter gamma distribution; (2) the Gumbel distribution; (3)
   the two-parameter log-normal distribution, and other distributions
   related to the normal by Box-Cox transformations. Calculation of the
   confidence limits is straightforward using the Nelder-Mead algorithm
   with a constraint incorporated, although care is necessary to ensure
   convergence either of the Nelder-Mead algorithm, or of the
   Newton-Raphson calculation of maximum-likelihood estimates. Methods are
   illustrated using records from 18 gauging stations in the basin of the
   River Itajai-Acu, State of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. A small and
   restricted simulation compared likelihood-based confidence limits with
   those given by use of the central limit theorem; for the same confidence
   probability, the confidence limits of the simulation were wider than
   those of the central limit theorem, which failed more frequently to
   contain the true quantile being estimated. The paper discusses possible
   applications of likelihood-based confidence intervals in other areas of
   hydrological analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The concentrations of deuterium and chloride in rainfall, soil water and
   throughflow are reported for flow components through a mid-level gently
   sloping hillside podzolic soil with a well developed network of
   macropores. The deuterium and chloride signatures of the throughflow are
   shown to resemble that of rainfall rather than soil water for all
   rainfall events. Flow through macropores is considered to be the major
   mechanism for infiltration and throughflow. During the initial stages of
   rainfall, infiltrating water bypasses much of the soil matrix and a
   transient water table is established. Storage associated with this water
   table dampens much of the noise from the deuterium and chloride
   signature of the rainfall while maintaining the mean rainfall signature.
   The possible implications on the use of stable isotopes and conservative
   tracers such as chloride for streamflow partitioning are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{To clarify the processes governing recharge of rainwater into an
   unconfined aquifer in a mountain basin, the seepage rate of water into a
   mountain tunnel was monitored continuously between May 1988 and December
   1991 in Yura, Wakayama, Western Japan. The electrical conductivity and
   ionic composition of the seepage water was also measured regularly from
   June 1989. The mountain is composed of fractured sedimentary rocks such
   as sandstones and cherts. Seepage appeared only at specific locations on
   the roof of the tunnel. Seepage was measured through overlying
   sandstones of 10 m depth and cherts of 5 m depth. Time variations in the
   discharge suggested that seepage is formed both by rapid flow and basic
   flow components which correspond to the so-called fissure flow and
   matrix flow. This was confirmed by analysis of time variations in the
   concentration of chemical species in the seepage water. Fissure flow
   contributes the initial increment of seepage discharge, immediately
   after the occurrence of rainfall, and its velocity for sandstone can be
   represented by a function only of water content (theta), alphatheta(n). 
   Alpha is constant and larger in winter than in summer, but n remains
   constant, at approximately two. Infiltration time in fissures through
   the base of the cherts is negligible, compared with that through the
   overlying soil layer. Whereas matrix flow through sandstones persists
   through the year, for cherts it disappears within a week after rainfall
   events and its decay is dependent on the seasonal magnitude of
   evapotranspiration. The behavior of the matrix flow for sandstones can
   be analyzed through a kinematic wave model, as can the fissure flow.}},

   Second, the potential of topological conjugacy to identify changes in

Abstract = {{Correlation analysis in conjunction with principal-component and

   evaluating selected physical and hydraulic properties of carbonate-rock
   aquifers in central Pennsylvania. Correlation and principal-component
   analyses were used to establish relations and associations among
   variables, to determine dimensions of property variation of samples, and
   to filter the variables containing similar information.
   Principal-component and correlation analyses showed that porosity is
   related to other measured variables and that permeability is most
   related to porosity and grain size. Four principal components are found
   to be significant in explaining the variance of data. Stepwise
   multiple-regression analysis was used to see how well the measured
   variables could predict porosity and (or) permeability for this suite of
   rocks. The variation in permeability and porosity is not totally
   predicted by the other variables, but the regression is significant at
   the 5\% significance level.}},

Abstract = {{A chemical hydrograph separation technique based on the mass-balance
   approach was extended to separate streamflow into three components in a
   small forested catchment in the southern Laurentians, Quebec. Using
   linear correlation analysis to identify chemical tracers capable of
   dividing a hydrograph for the Hermine catchment, streamflow was
   separated into groundwater, solum and upwelling flow. This new approach
   which calculated upwelling flow, i.e. solution forced from the
   groundwater up through the solum prior to reaching the stream, allowed
   us to determine the chemical behaviour of the tracers used in this
   particular study. Dissolved silicon was reactive since its concentration
   was modified by the pathway to the channel whereas total aluminium,
   hydronium, monomeric aluminium, fluoride and magnesium were non-reactive
   since their concentrations were controlled by the source of the
   solution.}},

Abstract = {{The East Fork of the Obey River, a tributary of the Cumberland River,
   drains a 523 km2 basin along the western margin of the Cumberland
   Plateau. The upper basin lies on clastic rocks that include coals that
   were mined earlier in this century. The lower basin is drained through a
   deep gorge where the East Fork has cut downward into the Mississippian
   carbonate rocks. The lower basin is karstic, with a 9 km length of the
   river and most of its tributaries underdrained by conduit systems. Many
   of the upper basin tributaries of the East Fork are contaminated by acid
   mine drainage and have high levels of acidity, sulfate, iron, and
   aluminum. As the acid mine waters sink in the limestone portions of the
   basin, they are buffered but acidity is not rapidly reduced and acid
   waters appear at a large spring deep in the karst having survived 5 km
   of transport. Sulfate waters gradually convert to bicarbonate waters as
   more tributaries from carbonate rocks enter the system. Aluminum in
   solution decreases with increasing pH, and precipitates as colloidal
   sized particles. Although alkalinity increases in the lower reaches of
   the basin, most of the waters remain highly undersaturated with respect
   to calcite.}},

Abstract = {{A statistical analysis of daily water-level changes in an abandoned coal
   mine indicates that precipitation affects the potentiometric level of
   the mine, independent of associated atmospheric pressure changes and
   changes in the water level of an overlying aquifer. The independent
   statistical effect of precipitation (0.99 cm of water-level change per
   centimeter of rainfall) is interpreted to reflect either lateral
   percolation from the coalbed's subcrop (1.2 km from the mine) or rapid
   recharge through mine-associated pathways, such as poorly plugged
   shafts, boreholes, or subsidence fractures. The relationship between
   water-level changes in the mine's voids and changes in the overlying
   aquifer is also statistically significant, but the regression
   coefficient (0.04) is an order of magnitude smaller than that for
   precipitation, indicating that vertical percolation (which is
   represented by covariance of the two aquifers) through undisturbed
   overburden may be less effective than the recharge associated with
   precipitation that bypasses the overburden. An equivalent analysis of
   water-level changes in an underlying unmined coalbed indicated that
   precipitation had a weaker direct effect (regression coefficient of
   0.34, compared with 0.99), although it was still the dominant
   independent variable. In contrast, the effect of water-level changes in
   an overlying aquifer (the flooded mine itself) was relatively stronger
   (regression coefficient of 0.15, compared with 0.04), indicating that
   vertical percolation through interburden is more important at depth.}},

Abstract = {{The phase lag in a meandering channel is the phase difference between
   the development (growth and decay) of secondary flow and the channel
   curvature. The secondary flow is predominantly driven by the channel
   curvature; its phase lag behind (downstream of) the channel pattern is
   an important feature in the mechanics of flow and the migration pattern
   of meander bends. This paper presents an analytical solution for the
   phase lag derived based on the mechanics of secondary flow. The physical
   process for this approach is the growth and decay of secondary flow
   which has a basis different from flow instability used in previous
   approaches. The analytical approach employs simplifying assumptions to
   focus on the role of secondary flow; its limitations in application are
   described. Major variables affecting the phase lag are identified to be
   channel roughness, suspended sediment concentration, flow depth, and
   meander arc length. It is very interesting to note that similar
   variables for the phase lag have been identified based on different
   physical processes. The results of this study are compared with previous
   studies as well as laboratory and field data; they suggest that phase
   lags in tight meandering channels are pronounced.}},

Abstract = {{Three cation exchange equations due to Vanselow, Gapon, and Gaines and
   Thomas are often used in transport models of ions subject to ion
   exchange with the solid aquifer matrix. The equations differ in the
   convention for the activity of adsorbed ions, and give different
   isotherm slopes for binary ion exchange pairs which influence calculated
   transport. In the binary case, the velocity of a composition is
   inversely related to the slope of the isotherm. The term `flushing
   factor' is introduced as an inverse velocity that permits the easy
   construction of elution curves. In the multicomponent case, the flushing
   factors are found as eigenvalues. An analytical solution is obtained for
   multicomponent (heterovalent) transport with shock fronts that can be
   validated with the flushing factor theory. This analytical solution is
   applied to the freshwater injection in a brackish water aquifer
   presented by Valocchi and coworkers. The results indicate that the
   Gaines and Thomas, and Vanselow conventions can adequately describe
   observed data with constant exchange coefficients for the binary
   exchange reaction pairs. The Gapon convention gives an S-shaped isotherm
   for multivalent ions that can easily lead to selectivity reversals; such
   selectivity reversal has not been observed.}},

Abstract = {{Simple analytical solutions are derived for groundwater flow in filled
   cylindrical conduits connecting multiple aquifers. Artificial conduits
   of this type are found in underground mining and nuclear testing
   settings, and can have a profound impact on groundwater flow and
   contaminant transport. The solutions demonstrate that conduit flux will
   depend on the bulk transmissivity of the conduit-aquifers system, and
   will be large only when there is little variation from this average
   throughout the system. If the upper aquifer is unconfined, flow is
   generally double that for a confined upper aquifer. Transmissivity of
   the unconfined aquifer has little effect on the magnitude of conduit
   flux. Application of these solutions at a representative underground
   nuclear testing site in fractured rock indicates a conduit flow
   approximately equal to that allowed by an unsealed borehole 0.3 m in
   diameter. In general, the impact of a large filled conduit will be
   similar to that of an abandoned well, as the effect of the greater
   conduit radius is offset by resistance to flow in the conduit fill.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying locations at which groundwater and surface water interact
   can be important in a variety of contexts including the development of
   water budgets, the determination of migration pathways for nutrients and
   contaminants, and the estimation of thermal budgets along small water
   bodies. Some difficulty has been experienced in identifying locations of
   inflows over large regions when detailed groundwater information is not
   known. A method is suggested herein for the identification of the
   location of inflows-outflows in both creeks and streams. This method,
   applied to a small creek in northern Indiana, involves measurement over
   time of both the sediment temperature and the temperature at the base of
   the overlying water column. The results are used to define reaches along
   the creek which are gaining and reaches along the creek which are
   losing. These results are supported by independent measurements of
   groundwater elevations at several points along the stream. It is argued
   that this method provides an excellent screening tool for the
   identification of gaining and losing reaches of small waterways.}},

Abstract = {{Major ion chemistry of the water of the Gaula catchment - a medium-sized
   Lesser Himalayan basin in Kumaun, was measured in 1983 and 1984. The
   results show the influence of rock weathering on the concentration of
   major constituents in the ground water and surface water. The catchment
   lithology contributes a large part of the major constituents in the
   waters; Ca and Mg account for 40-73\% of the cations and HCO3 accounts
   for 48-98\% of anions, and the equivalent ratio of Ca + Mg to Na + K is
   about nine. Cl + SO4 accounts for 12-16\% in the anion balance and does
   not represent a contribution from soil salt. The low Mg: Ca ratio
   (0.1-0.4) and high bicarbonate suggest the possibility of carbonate
   precipitation between the upper and the lower reaches. The excess Na
   over Cl, low Mg:Ca ratio and relatively high abundance of silica in the
   upper reaches indicate weathering of aluminosilicate minerals of
   crystalline rocks (granite, mica schist and quartz porphyry), and
   particularly of Na- and K-feldspar and quartz. Intense weathering of
   pyrite and or gypsum associated with the carbonate rocks is reflected by
   the substantially higher abundance of SO4, low silica and the low Na:Cl
   ratio. In comparison with the Indian peninsular rivers, the low
   concentrations of the major constituents in the water of this Lesser
   Himalayan catchment indicate rapid infiltration and quick outflow of the
   rainwater and thus a short residence time for water, during which
   interaction with the rocks could occur, because of the steep slopes.}},

Abstract = {{A three year study was carried out at a prairie slough to determine the
   hydrological processes occurring in the wetland and its surrounding
   uplands. On the upland slopes, snow accumulation was highly uneven,
   giving rise to spatial variations in infiltration and overland flow
   during melt. Rainfall distribution was more uniform but much of it was
   lost to evaporation, leaving minor amounts to groundwater recharge or
   runoff to the slough. The slough comprises a pond and its fringing
   non-flooded wetlands, the areal extents of which changed during the
   season as the pond expanded and contracted. Slough storage was rapidly
   replenished by the snow and ice melt in the slough and by the meltwater
   input through overland flow from the uplands. During summer, rainfall
   was the main source of water supply to the experimental slough, and
   evaporation exceeded water yield to the groundwater system. Water
   balance allows a contrast of hydrological conditions between years, with
   the drier years producing storage deficit for the slough, and wet
   summers producing a surplus.}},

   continuously 20 min means of micrometeorological elements such as air
   and dew point temperatures at 1 and 2 m, solar and net radiation, wind
   speed and direction at 2 m, soil heat fluxes at 8 cm (two locations),
   and soil temperatures at 2 and 6 cm during the three consecutive growing
   cycles. The gravimetric method (for 0-10 cm) and the Campbell Pacific
   Nuclear (CPN) Hydroprobe (for 20-150 cm) were used to measure soil
   moisture daily at 09:00 h. The 24 h evapotranspiration (LE, using the
   Bowen ratio-energy balance method) was computed by adding the 20 min
   mean LE values from 09:00 h until 09:00 h of the next day for comparison
   with the water balance method. Evapotranspiration measured by the water
   balance method was 98\% of that measured by the Bowen ratio-energy
   balance method during the experimental period (r = 0.987).}},

Abstract = {{Precipitation (rainfall plus snowfall), throughfall (canopy and free
   throughfall), stemflow and net precipitation (stemflow plus throughfall)
   data are presented for a network of collectors located in a fully
   developed lowland beech plantation. Precipitation averaged 640 mm year-1
   and conditions were relatively dry during the sampling period: the
   long-term average precipitation is about 800 mm year-1. Stemflow
   constitutes on average 5\% of the net precipitation and it varies
   according to season: from 1-2\% during the leafed to 6-16\% during the
   dormant winter period. The interception loss (the difference between
   precipitation and the net precipitation) averages about 14-16\% and
   varies to a limited degree through the year. The values are highly
   scattered but there are lower values for the first few months of each
   year: for January-March 1991 negative interception losses were recorded.
   These very low values appear to be associated with inputs other than
   precipitation (such as mist, dew, fog and ice) or snow, or a combination
   of the two; the water inputs to the catchment may well be underestimated
   at this time. Edge effects, if they exist, occur at less than 20 m from
   the edge and so are of little importance in relation to water resources.
   Storm damage and associated tree loss reduced interception loss although
   the effect is not as great as might have been expected: the loss of
   canopy is compensated in part by an increased roughness that in turn
   increases turbulence and hence interception losses. It is concluded that
   (1) the precipitation measurements provide the weakest link in
   estimating interception losses and (2) the network design used in this
   study is adequate for determining the spatial and temporal variation in
   net precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical solution is derived for a borehole dilution test
   conducted in the proximity of an extraction well under conditions where
   the Theis assumptions are applicable. The solution is similar to the
   steady-state velocity case except for a factor that accounts for the
   transient response of the aquifer to pumping. Curves calculated from the
   derived solution show a delay in response that increases with the
   specific storage of the aquifer and with the radius from the extraction
   well. The delay decreases with increasing values of hydraulic
   conductivity and aquifer thickness. Deviations of the response curves
   from the straight-line steady-state velocity case can be used to
   calculate the hydraulic diffusivity, while the limiting slope at late
   time can be used to calculate groundwater flux. When borehole dilution
   tests are conducted at several intervals over the thickness of the
   aquifer under steady-state velocity conditions, K(z) can, in principle,
   be calculated using several equations depending on the type of
   information available. Two existing methods to account for the
   distortion of the flow lines near the open test interval are related to
   well construction and development. Reasonable estimates of borehole
   factors can only be obtained for minimally developed wells.}},

Abstract = {{Specific objectives were: (1) to characterize the major `episode' of the
   year in a catchment in a region which is regarded as being sensitive to
   pollutant deposition; (2) to examine downstream compositional gradients
   and to explain them in terms of downstream changes in flowpath regime
   and differences in soil depth or type; (3) to test the hypothesis that
   both direct pollution inputs to the stream and the sea-salt effect are
   reflected in streamwater composition. Streamwater was collected, during
   two distinct snowcover melt events at two points, 400 m apart, with high
   time resolution. Snowcover and soilwater samples were also collected.
   There were distinct differences in the response of the stream at the two
   sites to the melt events; this was a consequence of spatially variable
   snowmelt regimes as well as of differences in soil and sub-snowcover
   hydrology. There were a number of unusual features apparent. There was
   no evidence of the almost ubiquitous base cation dilution associated
   with acidic episodes. There was also a most pronounced direct effect of
   pollution input at the uppermost stream sampling site because of the
   accumulation of pollution on top of a deep snowcover, the melt from
   which followed rapid flowpaths to the stream. The direct effect was not
   apparent at the lower sampling site, although evidence for the sea-salt
   mechanism was very clear, unlike the case for the top site. The evidence
   for an ion exchange control on streamwater Al3+ was strong at the lower
   site, but weak at the top site. The observations are interpreted via a
   schematic flowpath model.}},

Abstract = {{The clearing of native vegetation and its replacement with shallow
   rooted, annual crops and pastures has resulted in rising groundwater
   levels and concentration of salts in the surface soils of resulting
   groundwater discharge areas in the southwest of Western Australia. The
   potential to manipulate the recharge rates to groundwaters by using
   agronomic techniques to change catchment evapotranspiration (Et), has
   been the subject of much discussion.
   From 1986 to 1989, annual Et was estimated from daytime measurements of
   Et from annual pasture (existing pasture, subterranean clover, Medicago
   murex), crops (lupins, oats, rape, barley and wheat) and two perennial
   pastures (lucerne and phalaris) at a site near Collie in the southwest
   of Western Australia. The ventilated chamber technique was used to
   measure Et rates, together with ancillary measurements of above ground
   biomass and rooting depth. Seasonal values of Et are presented and
   combined to allow a boundary analysis of annual Et for each species. Et
   was found to be influenced by the amount and timing of biomass
   production, and by the rooting depth. The median annual
   evapotranspiration of annual pasture was shown to be the least (339 mm),
   and lupins the most (471 mm). The site environment combined high
   rainfall and low evaporative demand in winter, and low moisture-holding
   capacity of duplex soils with preferred pathways through subsoil clays.
   In this context, the potential of deeper rooted, perennial species to
   use more water, was apparent.
   It is argued that the smaller the difference in annual
   evapotranspiration between alternative and current agricultural practice
   (annual pasture), the larger the proportion of a catchment likely to be
   required for treatment to affect groundwater levels. Recharge
   manipulation alone, using the species tested, may not be sufficient for
   catchment salinity control. A wide range of other strategies exist; a
   combination of these, to suit the practical and economic constraints of
   the farmers, together with recharge manipulation, offers the best
   solutions for catchment management to control salinity in the southwest
   of Western Australia.}},

Abstract = {{The rectangular profiles assumption (as in the model of Green and Ampt)
   is utilized for developing an approximate model for one-dimensional,
   vertical, unsaturated flow with root water uptake. The simplified model
   reduces the non-linear partial differential equation (Richard's
   equation) for water movement to non-linear algebraic equations whose
   solutions require less computer effort. The basic hydraulic principles
   (continuity and Darcy's law) are retained in the approximate model. Soil
   surface boundary conditions of infiltration and redistribution are
   considered. Analytical solutions are available for the depth to the
   wetting front when the soil surface is held at saturation. Comparisons
   between the numerical solutions and approximate solutions are made for
   two distinct soil types. The approximate model predicts root water
   uptake quite accurately when compared with predictions from the
   numerical solution of Richard's equation. It is concluded that such
   simplified models hold promise in a variety of practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Natural and anthropogenic radionuclides were used to characterize the
   source of sediment reaching the underground river in the karst system at
   Jenolan, New South Wales, Australia. It was found that the relationship
   between Ra-226 and Th-232 concentrations, in both spatially averaged
   soil samples and transpored sediments, distinguished between two of the
   most likely source subcatchments. Sedimentary sequences, collected from
   within the underground system, showed that contemporary deposition was
   made up of an equal mixture of sediment from these two sources. However,
   at least three earlier deposition periods were also identifiable, each
   with different relative contributions from the source catchments. The
   first appearance of Cs-137 in the sedimentary sequence and correlations
   with historical information provided a chronology for these changes, and
   it is concluded that the contemporary phase was initiated in the early
   1950s, most probably by forestry activities. This work demonstrates that
   natural radioactivity can be used as a tracer of the origins of
   sediment, providing an important new approach to problems in sediment
   supply, transport, and deposition.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous sulfate concentrations were measured in incident precipitation,
   canopy throughfall, stemflow, soil water, groundwater, and streamwater
   at three locations in a 41 ha forested watershed at Panola Mountain
   State Park in the Georgia Piedmont. To evaluate the variations in
   sulfate concentrations, sampling intensity was increased during storms
   by automated collection of surface water and by incremental subsampling
   of rainfall, throughfall, and soil solution. Canopy throughfall,
   stemflow, and runoff from a bedrock outcrop in the watershed headwaters
   were enriched in sulfate relative to incident precipitation due to
   washoff of dry deposition that accumulated between storms. Soil waters
   collected from zero-tension lysimeters at 15 cm and 50 cm below land
   surface also were enriched in sulfate relative to precipitation,
   groundwater and streamwater. Sulfate concentrations in groundwater and
   in streamwater at base flow varied in an annual sinusoidal pattern with
   winter maxima and summer minima. Stream discharge and groundwater levels
   varied in a similar annual pattern in phase with the sulfate
   concentrations. The temporal variability of sulfate concentrations at
   most groundwater sites was small relative to the spatial variability
   among groundwater sites. Streamwater sulfate concentrations during base
   flow were controlled by low-sulfate groundwater discharge. As flow
   increased, an increasing proportion of shallow, high-sulfate groundwater
   and soil water contributed to streamflow. The dominant control on stream
   sulfate concentration shifted from sulfate retention by adsorption in
   the mineral soil at base flow to mobilization of sulfate from the upper,
   organic-rich horizons of the soil at high flow.}},

Abstract = {{Reservoir storage capacity determined by the double-cycling sequent peak
   algorithm has been investigated in previous studies for normal and
   log-normal inflows. Since annual streamflows have also been found to
   follow the gamma distribution, it is necessary to consider this
   situation and to cater for other possible situations. This paper
   considers the distribution of the storage capacity of reservoirs with
   gamma inflows that are either independent or first-order autoregressive.
   Empirical formulae for the mean and standard deviation of the
   non-dimensional capacity are obtained from Monte Carlo experiments for
   both full and partial regulation and for the entire realistic range of
   the lag-one autocorrelation coefficient. It is also confirmed that the
   standardized capacity may be represented by a three-parameter log-normal
   distribution.}},

Abstract = {{The isotopic composition of surface water and groundwater was used to
   investigate the mechanism of recharge of groundwater in the Axios River
   plain in northern Greece. Sampling of springs, for which the mean
   elevation of recharge could be estimated, in the Paikon Mountains
   provided an estimate of -0.28 parts per thousand per 100 m for the
   altitude effect. The deltaO-18 estimated for the recharge of the Neogene
   formation between the river valley and the Paikon Mountains agreed with
   many of the sampled locations. However, in the southwestern part of the
   area there is an indication of a contribution from the limestone
   formation of the Paikon Mountains.
   The stable isotopic composition of shallow groundwater close to the
   river indicates contributions from the river. Deeper groundwater farther
   away from the river also contains a proportion of infiltrated river
   water. Some of the boreholes close to the river have chlorinities
   ranging up to about 6000 mg l-1. The stable isotopic and chemical data
   indicate that the salinity is due to varying proportions of sea water,
   infiltrated river water and local recharge. The isotopic composition of
   Aravissos Spring water suggests that the spring is recharged by the
   upper series of the semi-metamorphic Paikon zone (dolomitic limestones,
   spilites-keratophyres and Gropi series; the mean altitude of recharge
   computed for the area so defined is 867 m and its potential annual
   yield, i.e. the amount of annual precipitation effective in recharge in
   this area, is 43.6 +/- 10 x 10(6) m3). This suggests that the actual
   annually exploited quantity of the spring water for the water supply of
   Thessaloniki (about 44 x 10(6) m3)  is at the limit of the corresponding
   potential yield.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with various methods of solving the complex problems of
   the hydrological transformation of rainfall into runoff in karst
   terrains. As an example of a typical karst catchment, the Crnojevica
   spring, located in deep Dinaric karst, is used to illustrate, explain
   and solve several hydrological problems in karst. The introduction deals
   with the geographical, geological and meteorological factors which
   conditioned a specific system of surface and underground flows, typical
   for karst terrains. The paper also explains some basic activities
   related to the identification of such a system. Special attention has
   been paid to the karst terrain of the Cetinje polje and its flooding,
   which occurred in February 1986. This flood initiated numerous intensive
   investigations which made it possible to define the catchment area of
   Crnojevica spring and the volume of the underground karst reservoir.}},

Abstract = {{Uniform flood frequency guidelines in Australia and the United States
   recommend the use of the log Pearson type 3 (LP3) distribution in flood
   frequency investigations. Many investigators have suggested alternate
   models such as the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution as an
   improvement over the LP3 distribution. Using floodflow data at 61 sites
   across Australia, we explore the suitability of various flood frequency
   models using L-moment diagrams. We also repeat the experiment performed
   in the original US Water Resource Council report (Bulletin 17B) which
   led to the LP3 mandate in the United States. Our evaluations reveal that
   among the models tested, the GEV and Wakeby distributions provide the
   best approximation to floodflow data in the regions of Australia that
   are dominated by rainfall during the winter months, such as southwest
   Western Australia and Tasmania. For the remainder of the continent, the
   Generalized Pareto (GPA) and Wakeby distributions provide the best
   approximation to floodflow data. The two- and three-parameter log-normal
   models and the LP3 distribution performed satisfactorily, yet not as
   well as either the GEV or GPA distributions. Other models such as the
   Gumbel, log-normal, normal, Pearson, exponential, and uniform
   distributions are shown to perform poorly. Recent research indicates
   that regional index-flood type procedures should be more accurate and
   more robust than the type of at-site procedures evaluated here.
   Nevertheless, this study reveals that index-flood procedures should not
   be restricted to a single distribution such as the GEV distribution
   because other distributions such as the GPA distribution perform
   significantly better in the most densely populated regions of Australia.}},

Abstract = {{The long tradition of catchment studies in hydrology results from the
   need to understand the water balance operating in basins, the processes
   controlling water movements and the impacts of land-use change on water
   quantity and quality. The interactions between physical, chemical and
   biological behaviour have become an increasingly dominant theme in
   recent years, and this has been boosted by global environmental problems
   such as acid rain and climatic change. After a historical summary of
   catchment studies, a brief review is given of some of the most
   influential experiments and their underlying objectives and results,
   concentrating on those concerned with one land-use change in particular
   - to/from forestry. In interpreting the effects of a change in forest
   cover, it is necessary also to consider impacts of the associated site
   disturbance, including possible soil compaction and road construction as
   a result of logging and any artificial drainage before tree planting.
   The recent tendency to link basin studies into networks is discussed,
   with examples of currently active networks.}},

Abstract = {{Evaporation from upland grassland is investigated using the results from
   two weighing lysimeters. The lysimeters were operated at a site on the
   Balquhidder catchments at an altitude of 595 m for 2 years (1988 and
   1989). The results show an evaporation rate which is significantly below
   that of the Penman evaporation (E(T)), particularly in the early part of
   the year, when the grass is dormant. The lysimeter data have been used
   to calibrate and assess a number of water use models designed to
   estimate grassland evaporation from meteorological measurements.
   Transpiration models to take account of the dormancy of the vegetation
   were tested using either a temperature function or a seasonally adjusted
   crop factor. The introduction of a simple interception model did not
   improve the model fit. A range of models gave a very good fit to the
   cumulative total evaporation; the most generally applicable model
   reduces the evaporation at low air temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{One annual and four seasonal models were operated with meteorological
   data for 1984 and 1985 to estimate the water use of the Balquhidder
   catchments. The most physically realistic models operated on three
   classes of vegetation (grass, heather and forest) distributed in three
   altitudinal zones and included transpiration estimates based on the
   Penman-Monteith equation and a daily exponential model of interception
   loss. Comparison of the model estimates indicates that the simpler
   models involving a larger number of assumptions but requiring fewer
   input variables gave results similar to those of the more physically
   sound models. The reasons for this are discussed.
   The most physically realistic model was operated with meteorological
   data for 1984-1989 to produce estimates of the water use of the
   Monachyle (grassland and heathland) and Kirkton (forest and grassland)
   catchments. The estimates differ systematically from catchment
   measurements of precipitation minus runoff but lie within experimental
   uncertainties. Reasons for the differences are examined and the
   sensitivity of the model to different assumptions and uncertainties is
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{The development of a model for the simulation of streamflow using only
   rainfall and evapotranspiration inputs at daily intervals presents
   special difficulties when using the data from the Kirkton and Monachyle
   catchments. The complex vegetation distribution in the Monachyle and the
   upper areas of the Kirkton, and the problems associated with the winter
   dormant grass made it necessary to modify the conceptual model which has
   been developed at the Institute of Hydrology for estimating the effects
   of land-use changes. Despite these difficulties, simulation of the
   streamflow in the calibration period produced volume agreement with
   observed values within 1\% on the Monachyle and 4\% on the Kirkton, and
   close agreement in the time distribution except during the few major
   snow accumulation episodes. Cumulative water use predicted by the model
   was in reasonable agreement with the catchment water balance estimates.
   A comparison of model estimates of soil moisture deficits with those
   observed by soil moisture neutron probe during plot studies produced a
   good correlation, providing further evidence of the validity of the
   model concepts. During the subsequent period, when the land use was
   being changed, the model also performed well. Simulating these changes
   in the model produced streamflow volume agreement with observations
   within 0.2\% in the Monachyle and 0.8\% in the Kirkton. This performance
   gave confidence in the use of the model to generate extended data sets
   for use in assessing the effects on water resources of various levels of
   afforestation in this environment.}},

   catchments situated near Balquhidder, Scotland. Using daily rainfall and
   streamflow data, natural differences between the quick and slow flow
   responses for the Kirkton and Monachyle catchments are quantified, and
   an attempt is made to detect the impact of land-use changes on these
   natural regimes (clear-felling in part of the Kirkton and drainage
   ditching and conifer planting in part of the Monachyle). Dynamic
   response characteristics for the quick and slow flow components are
   defined in terms of time constants, relative throughput volumes and unit
   hydrograph peaks. These response characteristics are estimated and
   compared for annual periods before and after the land-use changes. For
   both the Kirkton and Monachyle, the effects of the land-use changes
   (affecting part of each catchment) on the hydrological response are not
   detectable at the catchment outlets. The interannual variation of the
   dynamic response characteristics falls within the inherent uncertainty
   expected if no land-use changes had occurred.}},

Abstract = {{The Penman estimate of potential evaporation, E(T), is widely used as a
   reference level for comparison and subsequent extrapolation of the
   results of catchment water use studies, The steep topography and 600 m
   altitude range of the Balquhidder catchments presented difficulties in
   determining representative values of E(T) and in the selection of the
   most appropriate sites for data collection. A network of three automatic
   weather stations, subsequently increased to four, was installed to
   sample climate and E(T) variability within the catchments. For
   comparison, an additional station was installed at a valley-bottom site
   typifying the probable location of a conventional meteorological site in
   a less intensive study. Despite reliability problems with the original
   logging equipment, the initial data led to well-defined between-site
   relationships which were used to infill gaps in the E(T) records. These
   synthesised records revealed that, contrary to expectations, the
   high-altitude exposed sites gave significantly higher E(T) values than
   the valley-bottom sites. Data obtained using more reliable logging
   equipment over a recent 12 month period have been analysed in some
   detail. The results confirm the higher E(T) values from the
   high-altitude sites, identify factors contributing to the trend and
   suggest that E(T) values obtained from valley-bottom meteorological
   stations, or from present methods of extrapolation from lowland sites,
   significantly underestimate potential evaporation in this type of
   mountain terrain.}},

   The model was applied to climate and discharge data from the two
   Institute of Hydrology experimental catchments at Balquhidder to predict
   the sensitivity of a number of water resource measures to land-use
   change. This was achieved by deriving flow duration curves, annual

   for varous land-use scenarios. The results are presented in a form which

   Suspended sediments and bedload have been sampled during afforestation

   equations showed that most of the increase in suspended sediment was in
   the low flow ranges and the scatter in the data points also increased.
   Total sediment yields increased to 312\% of former levels in the
   Monachyle and 818\% in the Kirkton. These increases are probably due to
   a combined effect of the forestry land-use changes and increased
   precipitation. Pre-land-use change relationships have been applied to
   the later years to remove the effects of the precipitation increase.
   This has shown that yields caused by the forestry land-use changes were
   121\% (Monachyle) and 595\% (Kirkton) of former levels.}},

Abstract = {{The Balquhidder catchment results are discussed within the context of
   increasing knowledge of the underlying processes responsible for the
   hydrological effects of land-use change. Forests, in the wet uplands of
   the UK, will reduce water yield irrespective of whether they replace
   grass or heather moorland. The impacts of afforestation on low flows are
   less easy to generalise; it is recognised that although high evaporation
   rates from mature, closed-canopy forest will have a depressing effect on
   low flows, land drainage, which is often associated with upland
   forestry, may increase low flows in the short to medium term. Further
   research is necessary to investigate both the evaporation rates from
   immature forests and the impacts of drainage on low flows, in an upland
   context. This information should allow forest management schemes to be
   devised involving staggered planting, shorter rotation forestry and
   optimal drainage network design to minimise the adverse effects of
   forests on low flows.}},

Abstract = {{A 10 year record of water level fluctuations in a groundwater/lake
   system in northern Wisconsin shows that system dynamics are strongly
   influenced by seasonal transient effects as well as transience over the
   10 year period of record. These data were collected for the Long Term
   Ecological Research (LTER) program at the North Temperate Lakes site in
   northern Wisconsin, USA. The record included a period of relatively high
   lake levels from 1981 to 1985, followed by declining levels in 1986-1987
   and low levels in 1988-1990. Short-term transient effects in the form of
   seasonal groundwater mounds consistently occurred on all sides of the
   lake during 1981-1985 when regional water levels were high and during
   1986-1988 when groundwater levels were high relative to the declining
   lake level. Mounds did not form after 1988. These observations point to
   the importance of a long-term record in assessing the significance of
   short-term effects. Short-term transience affects the groundwater
   component of the lake budget because the mounds induce groundwater to
   flow toward the lake; when the mounds are not present, water flows away
   from the lake. Shifts in the groundwater regime will affect the lake's
   chemical budget in the long term. However, the trends in the chemical
   budget that occurred within our 10 year record, an inter-val shorter
   than the hydraulic residence time of the lake (12.7 year), are
   influenced more by changes in precipitation inputs than groundwater
   inputs.}},

Abstract = {{A prototype flow model has been developed for Cuballing catchment using
   MODFLOW. The results of the simulations showed that, in a first-order
   catchment, the management strategies most likely to arrest salinity were
   reforestation and pumping. The study confirmed that complete
   reforestation would arrest groundwater discharge and lead to the
   restoration of salinized land within the catchment. It also showed that
   replanting the top 25\% of the catchment was sufficient to reverse the
   salinity trend by reducing groundwater discharge to an acceptable level
   . Drainage along the main stream line was also effective in reducing
   groundwater levels in the unconfined aquifer and constrained the
   discharge in the area adjacent to the stream. The simulations also
   showed that pumping reduced groundwater pressures in both the unconfined
   and confined aquifers, A single windmill discharging at a rate ranging
   from 15 to 25 m3 day-1 was sufficient to reduce water levels in the
   unconfined aquifer by more than 5 m and in the confined aquifer by more
   than 10 m. However, the pumping well must be correctly located in the
   catchment. The preferred location is in highly transmissive areas with
   adequate aquifer thickness and upstream from geological structures
   restricting groundwater flow. In Western Australia, these areas are
   usually along drainage lines and within discharge areas.}},

Abstract = {{A study of water and salt balances within a first-order catchment in the
   Western Australian wheatbelt has shown that the salt load in the main
   surface drainage comes largely from groundwater discharging upstream
   from the basement highs and dykes that extend across the surface
   drainage and conductive channels within the regolith. Although salt fall
   from rainfall is about 2.0 g M-2  year-1 (Cl-), the stream load ranges
   from 180 to 850 g M-2  year-1 with an out/input ratio of 100-425. Salt
   storage in the catchment varies from 900-4000 g m-2 in the top 3 m, to
   27 000-71 000 g M-2 in the 3-15 m depth range and 5000-21 000 g M-2 
   below 15 m. Groundwater discharge calculated using Br and Cl as tracers
   for the groundwater component fluctuates between 20 and 40\% of
   streamflow. Stream salinity during the last 3 years was below the
   long-term average. This is attributed to a reduction in groundwater
   discharge caused by low rainfall during this period. The downward
   displacement and leaching of salt stored in the regolith indicates that
   if groundwater levels continue to rise, the quantity and salinity of
   groundwater discharge will continue to increase causing further rises in
   stream salinity.}},

Abstract = {{Kinematic wave models offer a powerful tool for interpreting erosion
   experiments and for forecasting soil and water losses under different
   management systems. One important problem is the identification of the
   model parameters. To estimate the influence of error in the estimation
   of parameters a sensitivity analysis was performed. A previous survey of
   the soil erosion literature provided data to establish the expected
   ranges for each parameter. Of the three main parameters, the interrill
   and rill erosion coefficients, and the rill water depth coefficient, the
   last is the most important since sediment concentration is most
   sensitive to variations in this parameter, although the range of
   variation in the model is affected by the reference values of the other
   parameters.
   A simulated rainfall experiment in rectangular plots of 5 x 15 m2 on a
   20\% slope provided data which were fitted to the model. The agreement
   between the model and the data was reasonably good. Sediment yield was
   related linearly to total runoff volume in individual simulation events.}},

Abstract = {{Lateral subsurface flow through the upper soil layers (stormflow zone)
   during storm events has been shown to be a dominant mechanism of
   contaminant transport in forested watersheds. Data bases for
   multi-region flow and transport modeling for hydrogeologic conditions
   where stormflow predominates are lacking. Direct measurement of the
   tracer flux under field-scale conditions are non-existent. The objective
   of this paper was to evaluate the significance of three hydrologic pore
   regions to stormflow. Two tracer releases were made from a buried line
   source during storm events and the spatial and temporal variability in
   solute concentration and the tracer fluxes were measured. During one of
   the injections, macropore flow was extremely rapid with solute transport
   to a downslope trench 65 m from the line source taking just 3.2 h.
   Mesopore flow appeared to be significant for short distances in that
   tracer movement to solution samplers just 3 m downslope of the line
   source occurred within 3 h of the release. Soil sampling 6 months after
   the second release revealed that the tracer plume was refracted in the
   direction of the fractured bedding plane, and therefore did not coincide
   with the array of samplers for distances greater than 13 m downslope of
   the source.
   Soil sampling data suggested that micropores served as a sink/source for
   Br-  with 47\% of the non-reactive tracer remaining immobilized by
   micropores at the termination of the study. Interaction between the
   upper 2 m of the stormflow zone and the groundwater system was believed
   minimal: however, lateral flow below 2 m was concluded to be
   significant.}},

Abstract = {{As an alternative to the Fickian model of solute diffusion-sorption in
   matrices of geological media. a first-order kinetic model with
   diffusion-equivalent rate parameters was developed using temporal moment
   analysis of breakthrough curves for a parallel fracture system, hollow
   cylindrical macropores, and cylindrical solid phase. Criteria on the
   difference between the breakthrough curves of the Fickian model and the
   first-order kinetic model were also derived through temporal moment
   analysis. The criterion for the parallel fracture system was examined in
   detail to determine the validity of a first-order kinetic model
   approximation in in-situ rock fracture systems. The accuracy of the
   approximation was greater for smaller fracture spacings, longer
   groundwater residence time, and larger matrix diffusion coefficients,
   but was independent of nuclide distribution coefficients. Existence of
   natural rock-fracture systems to which the kinetic model approximation
   can be applied was shown to be possible.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a geological layer as a natural barrier to retard
   migration of radionuclides is assessed using simple mathematical models.
   A sensitivity analysis is presented on barrier performance when
   radionuclides discharged from the repository are spread in a certain
   area of the hydrologically static rock-fracture system. Transport of the
   nuclides to the biosphere is expected to be governed by diffusion to
   and/or pumping through other layers rather than by groundwater
   convection within the layer. Radionuclide concentration in the fracture
   may be predicted by simple first-order model equations with
   diffusion-equivalent rate parameters, the solution of which is expressed
   in a simple exponential form. The time for radionuclide concentration in
   the fracture to attenuate below a safety standard, which can be obtained
   from the solution quite easily is used as a criterion of barrier
   performance. Geological layer characteristics which make the criterion
   smaller are considered to be more favorable in decreasing the
   probability of high public exposure caused by the polluted groundwater.
   The sensitivity analysis showed that the criterion is smaller for larger
   matrix diffusion coefficients, but not always smaller for higher
   sorption capacities of the geological medium.
   For comparison, a sensitivity analysis is presented on barrier
   performance when the nuclide is transported to the biosphere by
   groundwater convection as well as diffusion-sorption to rock matrices in
   a rock fracture system. The solution for a single fracture-rock system
   was obtained and the distance for the radionuclide plume to attenuate
   below a certain level was calculated as a criterion of barrier
   performance. Geological layer characteristics which make the distance
   shorter were considered to be more favorable in decreasing the
   probability of high public exposure. Results of the calculation showed
   that the criterion became smaller for larger matrix diffusion
   coefficients, and higher sorption capacities of the geological medium.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to determine the role of some plant parameters
   on stemflow generation. Stemflow measurements in individual shrubs of
   three semi-arid growing species (Diospyrus texana, Acacia farnesiana and

   rainfall conditions in northeastern Mexico. Stemflow coefficients for
   individual shrubs were developed. The analysis of variance showed a
   significant difference among the species for both natural and simulated
   rainfall conditions. The multiple linear models suggested that the
   number of branches and position on the canopy, instead of total
   projected branch area, controls stemflow. There were also suggestions
   that bark roughness, leaf and twig position may also explain some of the
   interspecific stemflow variation. This contribution was suggested by an

Abstract = {{This paper concerns contaminant transport phenomena in aquifers
   comprising fractured permeable formations. In contrast to deep rock
   formations with tight, almost impermeable matrix rock, we consider
   fractures embedded in permeable rock blocks. It is shown that in many
   cases (e.g. in sandstone formations) the advective transport of
   contaminants in permeable blocks can be identified as the major process
   leading to contaminant exchange between fractures and blocks.
   In the framework of the present study, a simplified conceptual model of
   the fractured formation is adopted. The conceptual model is formulated
   by sets of space linear differential equations subject to time-dependent
   boundary conditions. A closed form analytical solution of these sets of
   differential equations is developed. Calculations of the contaminant
   distribution along the fracture network are utilized to obtain
   breakthrough curves concerning the time variation of the average
   contaminant concentration in certain cross-sections of the fractured

Abstract = {{In a companion paper, referred to as paper I, the transport of
   contaminants in a fractured permeable formation was characterized and
   formulated. It was shown that advective movements in the fracture flow
   and the permeable block flow, as well as mixing between these two types
   of flow, are the most significant factors affecting contaminant
   transport and spreading in such formations. The basic formulation and
   the closed-form analytical solution developed in paper I invite the use
   of numerical schemes for a further analysis of the contaminant transport
   processes. In the framework of the present paper this target is
   achieved. A numerical solution scheme stemming from the conceptual model
   of paper I is developed. Simulations are performed by considering the
   various properties of the discrete fracture flow and the permeable block
   flow.
   The results of the present study indicate that fractured permeable
   formations can be represented by single continuum models provided that a
   sufficiently large number of sectors is included in the representative
   elementary volume (REV). The minimum number of sectors depends on the
   ratio between the specific discharge of the permeable block flow and
   that imposed by the fracture presence. This ratio is named the mobility
   number. The larger the mobility number the smaller the number of sectors
   which should be incorporated in the REV. Equivalent properties of the
   continuum representing the fractured permeable formation, such as the
   equivalent porosity and dispersivity, are determined and evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Median annual concentrations of Cl, SO4, HCO3, Na, K, Mg and Ca increase
   greatly downstream.in the River Murray along its 2500 km route to the
   sea. Chloride increases from less than 2 mg l-1 near the headwaters to
   about 170 mg l-1 near the downstream end of the main channel. Water near
   the head of the river has HCO3 balanced by similar equivalents of Na, Ca
   and Mg, while higher salinity water in the downstream half of the river
   is dominated by Na and Cl. Sources of these dissolved ions include: (a)
   sea-derived airborne salts, contributing essentially all of the Cl, Br
   and 80\% of the Na, and (b) rock-derived ions from weathering of
   sedimentary rock and soil minerals, contributing most of the observed
   HCO3, 80\% of the Ca, and 20-25\% of the Mg and SO,. Much of the change
   in chemistry along the axis of the Murray is due to influx of saline
   groundwater which has a major ion composition similar to sea water.
   Inflows of irrigation drainage water also enhance downstream transport
   of salts, especially HCO3.
   The stable isotope composition of the River Murray (deltaH-2 and
   deltaO-18) begins with relatively depleted heavy isotope abundances (-
   47 parts per thousand, - 8 parts per thousand) in the uplands of the
   southeastern margin of the Murray-Darling basin, increasing steadily by
   + 30 parts per thousand and + 6 parts per thousand, respectively, due to
   evaporative enrichment from river surfaces and influx of drainage
   returned from irrigation diversions. Despite the similarity of
   groundwater major ion chemistry to that of sea water, stable isotope
   compositions of groundwaters clearly demonstrate that water molecules
   from past marine incursions have been completely flushed from the
   system. Similarly, the Cl/Br ratios of groundwaters are not appreciably
   different from seawater values, indicating that dissolution of fossil
   evaporites does not contribute significant salt to the groundwaters or
   the river.}},

Abstract = {{At Birkenes, in southernmost Norway, cation exchange processes in peat
   bogs were investigated under saturated water flow conditions. Previous
   studies in this catchment have shown the importance of dynamic transport
   patterns of soil solution as the key to understanding streamwater
   chemistry. End-Member-Mixing Analysis (EMMA), developed on data from the
   Birkenes catchment and other sites, has so far been a useful concept in
   explaining the dynamics of stream chemistry. To obtain further
   information on the effect of water saturation on the degree of cation
   exchange during transport of soil solution, sodium chloride was injected
   into those parts of the peat soils along the main stream that are
   hydrologically saturated during rainstorms. The active buffer system of
   the soil matrix was effective in maintaining the level of the cations
   that were not added as a tracer. The tracer cation was fairly mobile
   under the experimental conditions, and only limited mobilization of
   other cations occurred. It is well known, from previous studies, that
   precipitation entering the catchment may reside there for days before
   leaving through discharge. The magnitude of cation exchange was less
   than might have been expected from the previous studies, which also
   considered hydrologically unsaturated conditions. The residence time
   during our experiments was probably insufficient for exchange that can
   be ascribed to classical equilibrium exchange. The extent of
   hydrodynamic dispersion is important for the magnitude of cation
   exchange.}},

Abstract = {{It is often desirable to replace simplifications used in water balance
   models by the conceptually simpler and more accurate Richards' equation,
   but obtaining the required soil hydraulic properties can prove to be
   difficult. This paper presents a simple method of estimating these
   properties from water content profiles taken first, after several days
   drainage from near saturation and second, at the lower limit of plant
   water extraction. The method consists of assuming appropriate initial
   and boundary conditions, together with simple functional forms for the
   properties involving three unknown parameters at each depth. Initial
   estimates are improved by solving Richards' equation and modifying them,
   the process being repeated once or twice to obtain exact agreement
   between measured and predicted water contents.
   The method was applied to numerically generated and field-measured water
   contents, Hydraulic conductivities at the water contents taken after
   drainage always agreed well with known and measured values, but for good
   agreement of water retention parameters a reasonable estimate of at
   least one matric potential was required. Success of the method was not
   affected by soil layering, nor were the estimates unduly sensitive to
   errors in assumed initial and boundary conditions. Estimates of
   evaporation from the soil surface were accurate when the potential
   evaporation was known.
   Additional data may be needed to estimate properties near saturation and
   conductivities in drier soils. Nevertheless, the method should prove
   useful in analysing much existing water content data and supplementing
   current methods of obtaining hydraulic properties from surrogate data.}},

Abstract = {{Physically based algorithms that estimate saltation, suspension and
   sublimation rates of blowing snow using readily available meteorological
   and land use data are presented. These algorithms are assembled into a
   model, the Prairie Blowing Snow Model (PBSM), and used to describe snow
   transport on fields in a Canadian Prairie environment. Validation tests
   of PBSM using hourly meteorological data indicate differences between
   modelled and measured seasonal snow accumulations between 4 and 13\%.
   Application of the blowing snow model using meteorological records from
   the Canadian prairies shows that the annual proportion of snow
   transported above any specific height increases notably with mean
   seasonal wind speed. An observed decrease in annual blowing snow
   transport and sublimation quantities with increasing surface roughness
   height becomes more apparent with higher seasonal wind speeds and
   temperatures. The annual quantity of snow transported off a fetch
   increases with fetch length up to lengths of between 300 and 1000 m,
   then remains relatively constant or slowly declines. Within the first
   300 m of fetch 38-85\% of annual snowfall is removed by snow transport,
   the amount increasing with wind speed. Beyond 1000 m of fetch, blowing
   snow sublimation losses dominate over transport losses. In Saskatchewan,
   sublimation losses range from 44 to 74\% of annual snowfall over a 4000
   m fetch, depending on winter climate. Notably, as a result of
   steady-state transport, the sum of snowcover loss due to blowing snow
   transport and sublimation does not change appreciably from its 1000 m
   fetch value for fetches 500 to 4000 m. The transition from primarily
   transport to primarily sublimation losses at the 1000 m fetch distance
   may be useful in assessing the effect of scale in snow hydrology.}},

Abstract = {{Flood forecasting depends essentially on forecasting of rainfall or snow

   hourly rainfall follows an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process.
   This assumption is based on the fact that the autocovariance structure
   of some point processes, such as hourly rainfall processes, is
   equivalent to the autocovariance structure of certain low-order ARMA
   processes. Two estimation and fitting procedures are investigated. The
   first takes all rainfall occurrences throughout the period of record as
   the basis for parameter estimation, and the second is an event-based
   adaptive procedure. These procedures are compared for rainfall data at a
   point and rainfall data averaged over a basin. Hourly rainfall from two
   gaging stations in Colorado, USA, and from several stations in Central
   Italy are used. Results show that the event-based estimation approach
   yields better forecasts.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic image of a shallow (45-160 m below the surface) aquifer in a
   25km2 area in the southwestern Sacramento Valley, California has been
   obtained by O-18/O-16 and D/H determinations of groundwater from
   municipal wells. The regular summertime drawdown of the water table is
   strongly correlated with municipal-wide increases in the deltaO-18
   values, particularly in wells with shallow perforation levels, thus
   demonstrating that the high O-18 water resides in the upper reaches of
   the aquifer and penetrates more deeply with increased discharge rates.
   These 1.5 parts per thousand enrichments in the deltaO-18 values are
   primarily attributed to infiltration of irrigation water that has
   penetrated to depths of at least 80 m. The increased deltaO-18 values
   correlate with increased deviation from the meteoric water line and with
   increased nitrate levels, indicating that the high O-18 groundwater
   component represents local meteoric water that has been enriched by soil
   evaporation processes in nitrogen-fertilized, flood-irrigated cropland.
   Isotopic gradients provide a new method for qualitatively determining
   subsurface permeability. Zones of low isotopic gradients, interpreted as
   high O-18 plumes, probably follow coarse-textured deposits of ancient
   stream channels. The O-18 gradients are primarily controlled by
   subsurface permeability, although additional influences may include: (1)
   the heterogeneous distribution of the high O-18 groundwater; (2)
   isotopic contributions from deeper groundwater; (3) variable perforation
   depths of the wells; (4) local differences in the water table level.
   Deeper, sodium bicarbonate groundwaters (300-650 m below the surface)
   have lower deltaO-18 values (to -9.4 parts per thousand) than the more
   shallow magnesium bicarbonate groundwaters, suggesting derivation from
   O-18 depleted meteoric groundwaters of the Sierra Nevada. Minor mixing
   of the deeper groundwater into the municipal discharge occurs, even
   though previous workers considered the deeper groundwater to be
   confined.}},

Abstract = {{Soil leachate data from a long-term lysimeter (soil column) experiment
   were compared with the predictions of the MAGIC acidification model in
   an attempt to validate the latter. Acid production from nitrification
   was a necessary model input. In the surface horizon, the model gave a
   good prediction of base cation concentrations and their time trends,
   provided the weathering rate was set at about 250 mEq.m-2 year-1.
   However, the predicted pH and Al were far too high: this probably shows
   that the Al(OH)3 control used in the model was inappropriate. At the
   base of the profile, pH and Al were modelled more satisfactorily but
   fluctuations in anion and base cation concentrations were out of phase
   from those predicted. This was because the model assumes instantaneous
   reaction throughout the soil profile whereas in reality downward
   transport takes a significant time. As the AI(OH)3 solubility constant
   in the model was not temperature-dependent, MAGIC failed to predict the
   small annual fluctuation in Al concentration in the lower horizons.
   Because of the incorrect Al and H+ modelling in the surface horizons,
   and possibly because vertical variation in selectivity coefficients was
   not accounted for, the model predicted a much larger decrease in soil
   base saturation than was actually observed.
   Soil processes in the MAGIC model appear to have been well chosen and
   modelled responses could all be observed in the experimental data. The
   model gave a good qualitative prediction of the experimental data and
   could be adjusted to give a reasonable quantitative prediction for many
   variables. In the surface horizon, however, and by extension in other
   soils with a dominating organic matter component, the Al(OH)3 control
   used was inappropriate and could lead to misleading results.}},

   high flow conditions show that pre-event water can contribute
   significantly to streamflow, especially in non-forested areas.

Abstract = {{Continuously monitored stream water conductivity and pH from the Hafren
   and Hore streams at Plynlimon, Mid-Wales, is examined. Large inputs of
   rainwater of high conductivity can be traced to the stream. For events
   producing low flows (less than about 1 mm h-1), the chemistry of the
   rainfall is not observed in the stream; for high flow events the
   rainfall chemistry influences not only the immediate stream response but
   also the conductivity-flow relationship in subsequent smaller storms.
   The data indicate that a strong differentiation of water types is
   present, even after the catchment has been inundated, and that
   evapotranspiration and dry deposition are important factors in the
   maintenance of conductivity gradients within the catchment. Comparison
   of the acidity (pH/Acid Neutralisation Capacity) with the conductivity
   shows that the acidity in the rainfall is removed by the catchment
   soils: whereas the rainfall conductivity may affect the stream
   conductivity directly there is no corresponding relationship for
   acidity. Rapid chemical reactions, such as ion exchange, control stream
   acidity but do not affect the conductivity of the stream waters to the
   same extent.}},

Abstract = {{Badley Moor Fen exists in a region of the UK where potential
   evapotranspiration exceeds annual rainfall. The wetland is maintained by
   an input of Chalk groundwater in an area where the groundwater aquifer
   is regionally confined below boulder clay. The large groundwater
   contribution to the water balance arises from a unique local geological
   situation on the margin of the valley floor that allows the vertical
   movement of groundwater to the surface under a strong upward head
   gradient. The groundwater contribution is the dominant water input and
   maintains saturation within the immediate vicinity of the source of
   groundwater. Surface water outflow, via adjacent drainage channels, is
   the major output. The groundwater component is also important in that,
   as a result of hydrochemical change in the groundwaters with flow
   towards the surface, tufa has been precipitated. The calcium bicarbonate
   rich groundwater and tufa accumulation have given the site a unique
   character, with an exceptionally rich calcareous fen community.}},

Title = {{THE INFLUENCE OF PRE-DEVENSIAN GLACIAL DEPOSITS ON THE HYDROGEOCHEMISTRY
   OF THE CHALK AQUIFER SYSTEM OF NORTH NORFOLK, UK}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{144}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of hydrochemical facies in the Chalk aquifer system of
   north Norfolk, UK, is interpreted to reveal the hydraulic and
   hydrogeochemical processes operating in the area. The occurrence of two
   distinct glacial tills covering the Chalk aquifer is shown to dominate
   aquifer conditions. Chalk groundwater in the interfluve regions covered
   by Chalky Boulder Clay is characteristically of the order of 10 000
   years old and compares with Chalk groundwater of about 1000-2000 years
   old in areas covered by North Sea Drift. The difference in age reflects
   the different mechanical compositions of the two glacial tills, with the
   Chalky Boulder Clay containing a higher clay content and lower sand
   content than the North Sea Drift.
   Hydrochemically, Chalk groundwater from beneath Chalky Boulder Clay is
   distinguished from groundwater associated with North Sea Drift by a HCO3
   concentration of 300 mg l-1, with higher values occurring beneath Chalky
   Boulder Clay. The reason for the difference is that recharge water
   entering the carbonate-depleted soils developed on North Sea Drift
   attains calcite saturation for low values of soil PCO2 (in the range
   10(-2.5)-10(-2.0)) whereas recharge entering carbonate-rich soils
   developed on Chalky Boulder Clay achieves calcite saturation for higher
   values of soil PCO2 (in the range 10(-2.1)-10(-2.0)). Additionally,
   pyrite oxidation and SO4 reduction associated with the Chalky Boulder
   Clay interfluve regions evolve further HCO3 and, to maintain calcite
   equilibrium, increase the dissolved PCO2 of the Chalk groundwater.
   In the interfluve regions, Mg, Sr and SiO2 are able to increase because
   of the groundwater residence time which favours incongruent dissolution
   of the rock carbonate and breakdown of clay minerals contained in the
   glacial deposits and the Chalk. In contrast, modem valley zone Chalk
   groundwaters contain high concentrations of NO3 (up to 120 mg l-1), SO4
   (up to 130 mg l-1) and Cl (up to 100 mg l-1) contributed by
   contamination, mainly from an agricultural source.
   The hydrochemical interpretation demonstrates that the varying glacial
   deposits are important in controlling recharge and groundwater flow
   within the Chalk aquifer. The Chalk aquifer in the interfluvial areas
   experiences minor recharge whereas the Chalk in the valley zone receives
   direct, modern recharge water. At the fluvial margin, glacial sands and
   gravels control the storage and release of water, transferred laterally
   through the glacial tills, to the high-transmissivity Chalk in the
   valley zone.}},

Abstract = {{A quantification of groundwater fluxes in the hydrologic cycle for large
   river basins and on a global scale is reported in this paper.
   Groundwater contributions to river runoff (i.e. baseflow), direct
   submarine groundwater discharge to the ocean floor, and salt throughput
   to oceans and seas are analyzed. The baseflow/precipitation and
   baseflow/river runoff ratios are found to be approximately 10\% and 30\%
   on a world-wide basis, showing great geographical variability across the
   major continents of the Earth. Direct groundwater discharge to the ocean
   floor is only 6\% of the total water influx to oceans and seas, yet, it
   contributes a salt load to oceans and seas that is approximately 50\% of
   the salt loading by rivers. Factors and uncertainties germane to global
   groundwater balancing, recent anthropogenic modifications of groundwater
   contributions to runoff, and the likely role of potential global warming
   in groundwater circulation are discussed. Over the last 300 years
   baseflow contribution to river runoff has slightly increased, whereas
   the river runoff has declined as a result of anthropogenic modifications
   to the natural environment. Assuming a 10\% increase in global annual
   precipitation from potential greenhouse warming, the associated
   increases in baseflow contribution to river runoff and direct
   groundwater discharge to oceans would amount to 1200 km3 year-1 and 260
   km3 year-1, respectively. The additional salt load to oceans and seas by
   direct groundwater flow is estimated at 140 000 000 t year-1. Salinity
   of oceans and seas could rise if their water volumes do not increase
   enough to offset the larger salt load.}},

Abstract = {{In the Beer Sheva region of the Negev desert, the only significant fresh
   groundwater is contained within the Judea Group carbonate aquifer. It is
   found that this aquifer holds two distinctly different old water bodies.
   One such groundwater body has evolved in equilibrium with the carbonate
   aquifer rocks after being recharged during the Holocene in the Hebron
   Mountains north of the study area. At present, modern recharge, as
   denoted by the tritium and radiocarbon contents, is very minor. A subtle
   `piston effect' generated by contemporary replenishment is discussed in
   representative hydrographs in Beer Sheva wells. Another groundwater body
   identified in the Judea Group aquifer derives from the underlying Kurnub
   Group aquifer. The regional artesian Kurnub Group aquifer (Nubian
   Sandstone) contains an older and brackish groundwater body which has
   been recharged in Sinai during Pleistocene pluvials. Faulting in the
   Beer Sheva region facilitated hydrologic contact between the two
   aquifers. Exploitation of the Judea Group has released confining
   pressures and resulted in the intrusion of Kurnub Group water into the
   overlying Judea Group carbonate aquifer. This process is most
   significant in those wells drilled close to major faults where salinity
   increases with pumping. The intruding water originating from the Kurnub
   Group sandstone aquifer has not yet equilibrated chemically with the
   carbonate host. The low pH and high temperatures that have been
   encountered indicate continuing and very recent intrusion. In the Beer
   Sheva area, in the absence of direct significant modern recharge (as
   determined from tritium and C-14 values), all waters should be
   considered as paleowaters that are being mined. A complete revision of
   the hydrologic concept by which the multiple aquifer system can be
   exploited is required, to take into account the fact that the fresh
   Judea Group groundwater is actually an old (Holocene) water body
   intruded by brackish and older (Pleistocene) water along fault zones.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental tritium (H-3) variation during the 1991 water year was
   investigated in three Piedmont streams within the Upper Ocmulgee basin
   of Georgia. Baseflow tritium concentrations typically varied between 20
   and 30 TU; approximately twice that of weighted annual rainfall for the
   past 2 decades. Statistical treatment of these data indicated that the
   mean residence time of groundwater which comprises Piedmont Province
   baseflow is approximately 15-35 years. Annual tritium trends were
   similar in the three basins which varied over three orders of magnitude
   with respect to watershed area. The observed trends were not, however,
   directly coupled with rainfall and baseflow discharge rates. Tritium
   concentrations were highest at the beginning of the water year (24-31
   TU) and were diluted by 17-22\% during the fall, coincident with only a
   minor amount of rainfall. Concentrations declined by only a few tritium
   units during the wettest portion of the year. The 200-300\% increase in
   baseflow which occurred as the result of above-normal rainfall was
   comprised essentially of `old' water. At no time during the year did
   baseflow tritium concentrations approach values representative of recent
   rainfall. These data indicate baseflow discharge should be regarded as a
   dynamic mixture rather than as a static reservoir of water. The annual
   variation is, however, systematic which has important implications for
   future hydrographic and geochemical studies within this region.}},

Abstract = {{The advantages of incorporating variable length time steps into
   deterministic hydrological models are discussed and a method based on
   the use of rainfall thresholds to determine appropriate length steps
   automatically is presented. The method has been incorporated into a
   continuous catchment hydrology simulation model that was developed from
   an earlier version of a single-event flood model. The model, data
   preparation, and results analysis and display functions are all
   contained within a more general model application software package
   (HYMAS - Hydrological Modelling Application System), which is currently
   being developed. A brief description of the components of the model is
   provided, with emphasis on the effects on their operation using
   different length time steps of modelling. Data from a semi-arid
   grassland catchment in South Africa and an arid catchment in Arizona,
   USA, are used to illustrate that a variable time interval approach can
   improve the overall efficiency of a model.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical characteristics of surface water, base flow and groundwater
   in a first-order catchment in the wheatbelt of Western Australia were
   used to study the weathering process and its relationship to the
   development of groundwater and stream salinity. Meteoric water
   infiltrates through the unsaturated zone to the water table aquifer and
   through the aquifer outcrop in the case of a confined aquifer. The
   groundwater composition changes in space and time, becoming more saline
   with depth and distance away from the recharge zone. The concentration
   of salt in the system can be explained by four main mechanisms:
   withdrawal of water through uptake by plant roots for transpiration;
   loss of water during the weathering process and the formation of new
   minerals; leakage between aquifers; evaporation upstream of geological
   structures and near discharge zones.
   The groundwater is mainly of Na-Cl type, and is at saturation with
   respect to most of the carbonate minerals, chalcedony, talc and
   tremolite. The water changes in its chemical composition as rock-water
   interaction takes place. The weathering products are gibbsite and
   kaolinite, with the release of Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, HCO3- and H4SiO4.
   The preclearing weathering products are produced in a system open to CO2
   (through the plant roots), with groundwater under this system having
   excess Na+. After clearing the system becomes depleted in CO2 and the
   groundwater becomes depleted in Na+ through exchange with Mg2+ from the
   rock surface. Geochemical modelling showed that most of the constituents
   in groundwater can be accounted for by taking into consideration the
   constituents of rainfall, with minor additions from the weathering
   process.}},

Abstract = {{A major problem in managing and reclaiming saline land is identifying
   areas of recharge and discharge in a catchment. In a first-order
   catchment in the wheatbelt of Western Australia, four trends of water
   level changes have been observed: monotonically rising water levels;
   continuously rising water levels with seasonal fluctuations;
   continuously falling water levels; seasonally fluctuating water levels.
   Each pattern is associated with a specific hydrologic mechanism -
   recharge, recharge-discharge and discharge. The spatial distribution of
   the aquifer systems in the catchment follows a configuration which is
   controlled by the basin morphology. Recharge takes place in confined
   aquifers at the watershed and in the uplands; recharge-discharge occurs
   in the unconfined to semiconfined aquifer of the midslopes, and
   discharge becomes dominant along the unconfined aquifers of the drainage
   lines. The main areas of discharge of higher-salinity groundwater occur
   just upstream of geological structures along the drainage line. Surface
   water dams were found to contribute to the establishment of new
   discharge areas. They cause increased pressure in the deep aquifers,
   resulting in a rise in water levels and groundwater discharge below the
   dams.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of traditional soil management practices (ridge tillage) on
   the parameters and applicability of Philip's infiltration equation was
   evaluated during the rainy season (1987) in an upland area located in
   the Samin watershed, Indonesia, about 800 m above mean sea level. A
   double ring infiltrometer was used. Sortivity (S) was determined by
   fitting field data, using the equation S= I/t1/2 at an elapsed time of 5
   min, where I and t represent cumulative infiltration (cm) and time,
   respectively. Traditional tillage treatments significantly influenced
   the spatial variability of the sorptivity and soil surface saturated
   conductivity (K(s)). The relationship between S and clay content, and
   initial soil moisture content, was weak. The non-tilled or older tilled
   areas exhibited mostly matrix K(s) and more recent tilled areas
   exhibited macroporosity. Equating a second parameter (A) in the Philip's
   equation with the K(s) yielded a fair agreement of calculated cumulative
   infiltration with the experimental data. However, extra care was
   required in choosing the constant A in the case of newly cultivated
   areas. Averaging parameters S and A on the basis of tillage treatment
   gave a reasonable representation of the cumulative infiltration in the
   experimental area. The error varied from 17.7\% to 33.2\%. Excellent fit
   of calculated values of cumulative infiltration with the experimental
   data for individual measurement was obtained by evaluating parameters S
   and A using multiple linear regression analysis. Averaging the values of
   S and A resulted in a slightly more accurate predicted value than the
   previous method, with an error variation of 16.2-31.5\%. Further, the
   sorptivity obtained from the multiple linear regression approach and the
   previous equation mentioned were highly correlated (r=0.96).}},

Abstract = {{A conceptual groundwater flow model for the Cainozoic sequence of the
   Gambier Embayment of the Otway Basin, South Australia, is developed
   using hydraulic head distribution, environmental isotopes and
   hydrochemical data.
   Local flow cells occur within the upper sequence of the Gambier
   unconfined aquifer and are recognised by local relief of the water table
   and as rapid lateral variations in chloride, C-14, deltaH-2 and
   deltaO-18 concentrations, indicating that regional flow is not dominant
   in the upper portion of the unconfined aquifer. These localised systems
   are topographically controlled and have developed in response to
   undulating stranded coastal dune ridges of the Bridgewater Formation.
   Recharge areas correspond to dune highs while discharge is focused
   towards the lower lying interdunal regions.
   Total dissolved solids concentrations are controlled by
   evapotranspiration processes during recharge and ion ratios are modified
   by water rock interactions within the groundwater system. Groundwaters
   are more dilute in the southern section of the basin where the surplus
   of precipitation over evapotranspiration in the winter months is greater
   than that in the northern section of the basin.
   A regional flow system with interaquifer mixing has developed within the
   confined Dilwyn aquifer system. Recharge to the Dilwyn aquifer has been
   identified downgradient from the basin margin via downward leakage from
   an intermediate flow system within the Gambier unconfined aquifer to the
   deeper regional flow system of the confined Dilwyn aquifer. Interaquifer
   mixing appears to be geologically controlled; in the south by the
   elevated Gambier axis and in the north by the Kanawinka Fault.
   Downgradient of the zero head difference line, lateral flow appears to
   be the dominant transport mechanism within the Dilwyn aquifer as
   indicated by constant chloride concentrations, monotonic decrease in
   radiocarbon concentration and more negative deltaH-2 and deltaO-18
   composition. the Dilwyn aquifer as indicated by constant chloride

Abstract = {{A kinematic-wave based computer model has been used to examine the
   effect of basin slope on the increase in flood peak due to urbanization.
   The degree of urbanization is expressed in terms of percentage area made
   impervious, and percentage area served by storm sewers. The study covers
   basins with constant slope as well as variable slopes. In the latter
   case, the basin slope steepens progressively from downstream to upstream
   sub-basins. The results show that as urbanization progresses from
   downstream to upstream, there is an accelerated rate of increase in
   flood peak for basins with constant slope; as opposed to a decelerated
   rate of increase in flood peak for basins with variable slope. In
   addition, for the case with constant basin slope, the increase of peak
   flow due to urbanization is greater for the basin with a steeper slope.
   While the impervious and sewered areas have comparable effect on the
   increase of flood peak for basins with constant slope, the effect of
   impervious area is much greater than that of sewered area for the basin
   with variable slopes.}},

Abstract = {{Water balance data have been collected since 1969 from the Institute of
   Hydrology's long-term experiment on Plynlimon, Mid-Wales, with the
   primary aim of quantifying the differences in evaporation between the
   67\% forested Severn and the grassland Wye catchments. Evaporation
   differences between the two catchments, and hence between the two land
   uses, have been established with increasing precision as the experiment
   has proceeded; however, the absolute hydrological responses to natural
   and man-induced fluctuations in climate take longer to quantify.
   Analysis of trends in time series data from the catchments indicates
   increased rainfall and flow over the study period, particularly during
   the summer, with the difference between them, actual evaporation,
   declining markedly in both main and sub-catchments. A partial
   explanation for the reduction implicates a decline in atmospheric demand
   for moisture, caused by increased cloud interception of incoming
   radiation, colder air temperatures which lead to a lowering of the
   vapour capacity of the atmosphere and, most markedly, a decline of 30\%
   in specific humidity deficits above the crop. Other potential
   physiological controls are discussed, including changes in atmospheric
   carbon dioxide and tree root damage by acid rain.}},

Abstract = {{Wind velocity and temperature profiles measured by radiosondes were used
   in combination with near-surface air temperatures, in order to derive
   surface fluxes of sensible heat H and of momentum u{*}. The role of the
   near-surface air temperature was to stabilize the otherwise noisy
   radiosonde profiles. The computational procedure was developed from
   standard Monin-Obukhov flux-profile relationships for the atmospheric
   surface layer. The measurements were made in the context of the
   International Alpine Experiment ALPEX at the Rietholzbach catchment in a
   region of complex rugged terrain of the Swiss Fore-Alps. The positive
   correlation (r = 0.7) between the profile derived values of H and those
   obtained at a central station of the catchment, supports the existence
   of a surface layer even above this very rough terrain. The values of
   latent heat flux (evaporation) obtained from these H values by means of
   the energy budget agreed well (r = 0.94) with lysimeter measurements at
   the central station.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years the acquisition of considerable additional data on the
   hydrogeochemical behaviour of fluoride in natural waters of Kenya has
   been made possible by extensive surface-water and groundwater sampling
   campaigns as well as by improvements in analytical techniques.
   Ultimately, the principal source of fluoride relates to emissions from
   volcanic activity associated with the East African Rift System. Through
   various intermediate steps, but also directly, fluoride passes into the
   natural water system and components of the food chain. Ingestion by man
   is mainly through drinking water and other beverages. River waters in
   Kenya generally have a fluoride concentration lower than the recommended
   level (1.3 ppm) for potable water, thus promoting susceptibility to
   dental caries. Groundwaters and lake waters show considerably higher
   fluoride contents, resulting in the widespread incidence of fluorosis in
   areas where groundwater is the major source of drinking water, and lake
   fish is a regular component of the diet. This paper presents a synthesis
   of the data so far obtained on the sources and distribution of fluoride
   in the hydrological system of Kenya, examines the extent of fluorine
   toxicity and puts forward recommendations to combat or minimise the
   problem.}},

Abstract = {{The daily occurrence of large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns
   (CPs) is linked with the partial duration series of floods, using a case
   study in Central Arizona (USA) to illustrate the approach. The
   probabilistic linkage is evaluated by means of two performance indices,
   relating flood occurrence, observed CP occurrence before floods and
   purely random count of CPs. Three seasons (summer, autumn and winter)
   are distinguished, and CPs are grouped into two flood-producing groups
   year round, and two more such groups in winter. Floods in five
   watersheds, whose areas range from 900 to 15 000 km2, are analyzed for
   the period 1940-1980. The number of days N to be considered before the
   flood day is investigated using the first performance index, yielding a
   value of 1-3 days. The two performance indices appear to measure the
   linkage in a suitable way, especially in the autumn and winter seasons.
   The first index, measuring the ratio of percentage of floods explained
   by the two (or four) groups of flood-producing CPs to the percentage of
   CPs in the population, is well above 1.5. The second index, measuring
   the probability of at least k days out of N with CP type i before the
   flood day, is considerably greater than the corresponding binomial or
   Bemoulli value. Results for summer, when precipitation stem from
   convective storms, are not as clear-cut. In any case, this method makes
   it possible to study the effect of non-stationarities in the time series
   of CPs, and results should improve when daily precipitation or at least
   daily flows are considered.}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of hydrological parameters at ungauged sites have
   traditionally been obtained from regression equations. This study
   investigates alternative methods based on the classification of
   catchments into groups according to their flow regime, the assignment of
   ungauged catchments to a group based on physical characteristics of the
   catchment, and the use of similarity measures to transfer parameters
   from gauged to ungauged catchments. The paper considers the methods that
   can be adopted in this type of approach and the many variations that
   must be considered in their implementation. The methods are examined
   using a set of 99 catchments from the UK and are seen to be efficacious
   in estimating the unit hydrograph time to peak and standard percentage
   runoff, as defined by the UK Flood Studies Report.}},

Abstract = {{Prior hydrogeochemical studies have documented a down-gradient increase
   in dissolved calcium, magnesium and SO4 in the confined, upper Floridan
   aquifer and have attributed the changes to dissolution of gypsum and
   dolomite and precipitation of calcite. In this study, hydrochemical data
   (mol l-1) are coupled with calculated discharges (1 year-1) to calculate
   the down-gradient changes in ion fluxes (mol year-1) along two
   predevelopment stream tubes in west-central Florida. Evaluation of ion
   inflows (including leakage from above) and outflows to and from
   well-to-well sectors of the stream tubes enables isolation of the
   changes in ion fluxes due to the previously identified reactions and,
   hence, quantification of the geological work done by those reactions in
   the sectors. Over about half of the stream tubes, the amount of calcite
   precipitation is small to non-existent (0 +/- 0.25\% of the bulk volume
   per million years), which is consistent with geological evidence.
   Significant cementation rates are calculated for areas influenced by
   upward flow, such as at the end of the stream tubes and along the Peace
   River. Half of these significantly large values are impossibly large,
   apparently reflecting an inherited signal from a flow history below the
   depth of the upper Floridan wells. Similarly, mass-balance results that
   suggest significant dissolution of dolomite and gypsum probably reflect
   upwelling, not diagenesis at the depths of the sampled wells.}},

Abstract = {{Maximum likelihood and censored sample theory are applied for flood
   frequency analysis purposes to the log Pearson Type III (LP3)
   distribution. The logarithmic likelihood functions are developed and
   solved in terms of fully specified floods, historical information, and
   parameters to be estimated. The asymptotic standard error of estimate of
   the T-year flood is obtained using the general equation for the variance
   of estimate of a function. The variances and covariances of the
   parameters are obtained through inversion of Fisher's information
   matrix.
   Monte Carlo studies to verify the accuracy of the derived asymptotic
   expression for the standard errors of the 10, 50, 100, and 500 year
   floods, indicate that these are accurate for both Type I and Type II
   censored samples, while the bias is less than 2.5\%. Subsequently, the
   Type II censored data were subjected to a random, multiplicative error.
   Results indicate that historical information contributes greatly to the
   accuracy of estimation of the quantiles even when the error of its

Abstract = {{Existing simulation models of unsaturated flow in heterogeneous soils
   usually suffer from simplifying assumptions hardly ever met in nature.
   In contrast to this, the stochastic model presented here avoids
   unrealistic restrictions. The physically based flow model consists of a
   mass conservative form of the Richards' equation, which can be applied
   to unsaturated and saturated flow as well. The similar media concept is
   used to describe spatial variability of the characteristic soil
   functions. In order to use all measurement information available, a
   stochastic soil model including conditional distributions is
   established. The model is based on classical Gaussian techniques and
   does not refer to so-called geostatistical tools like kriging. A
   reduction test based on the well-known maximum likelihood principle is
   also implemented. Therefore, the stochastic model preserves only
   significant parameters.
   The two submodels - the conceptual flow model and the stochastic soil
   model - are coupled by perturbation. Taylor series expansions of the
   soil characteristics are used to establish a system of differential
   equations describing moments of flow variables; this is solved
   numerically by an implicit scheme. The model takes into account
   arbitrary initial and boundary conditions as well as arbitrary
   characteristic soil functions. Complex geometries can be handled easily
   by means of curvilinear coordinates.}},

Abstract = {{The advection-dispersion equation (ADE) does not necessarily provide a
   good description of solute transport in undisturbed soil cores and field
   plots, as a result of heterogeneities in pore water velocities related

   preferential flow and `immobile' pore water effects. However, it is
   often used as a functional description of solute transport and this
   paper reviews the results of applying the ADE to undisturbed soil core
   and field plot experiments. Very wide ranges of dispersion coefficients
   and dispersivities have been found. Information available on the spatial
   variability of the solute transport parameters is also reviewed and
   suggests that local dispersion parameters may commonly be log normally
   distributed.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial variability in both the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the
   pore-size distribution is incorporated in a stochastic model of
   field-scale solute transport through the unsaturated zone. The transport
   model considered is based on a Lagrangian framework, in which the
   expected field-scale solute flux and the associated uncertainty in
   predictions are defined from distributions of solute travel time.
   Expressions for such travel time distributions are derived from
   statistical information on measurable soil hydraulic properties and are
   used to analyze the statistics of the field-scale solute flux in
   heterogeneous soil. The spatial variability in the saturated hydraulic
   conductivity and in the pore-size distribution has a similar effect on
   the prediction uncertainty, quantified by the variance of the solute
   flux, as on the expected breakthrough curve. The effect on the relative
   prediction uncertainty, quantified by the coefficient of variation for
   the solute flux, is therefore small. Both the solute flux variance and
   the coefficient of variation decrease rapidly with increasing size of
   the input domain and are considerably smaller for a planar source than
   for a linear one.}},

Abstract = {{A model for the simulation of solute transport in aggregated porous
   media is presented. Transport by convection and dispersion in the mobile
   phase, diffusion of solute inside aggregates of arbitrary shapes and
   sizes, external mass transfer resistance and linear adsorption are
   considered. Depth-dependent properties of porous media and size
   distribution of aggregates are accounted for. The problem of solute
   diffusion inside arbitrarily shaped aggregates is rigorously and easily
   treated by application of the Laplace transformation and by introduction
   of an `aggregate shape function'. The whole system of equations is
   solved by: (1) application of the Laplace transformation; (2)
   introduction of the `aggregate shape function' to reduce the transport
   problem to a single ordinary differential equation whatever the geometry
   of aggregates and the phenomena accounted for (kinetic or instantaneous
   adsorption, external mass transfer resistance); (3) finite-difference
   numerical solution of this differential equation; (4) numerical
   inversion of the solution obtained in the Laplace space.
   The main advantages of this model are: (1) it incorporates, in a unique
   frame, the whole variety of models so far proposed for transport
   modelling in aggregated porous media (zero-, first- and higher order
   approaches); (2) it simplifies the numerical treatment so that there is
   no need to make simplifying assumptions about the phenomena; (3) it
   provides an accurate solution using very little computer time.
   The model is compared with previous solutions, analytical or numerical,
   obtained for simple aggregate geometries.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of various aggregate size distributions on solute
   transport is analysed from a quantitative and qualitative point of view.
   Uniform, normal, log-normal and discrete aggregate size distributions
   are considered. The model described in Part 1 is used to calculate the
   breakthrough curves. The second-order moments and the sum of squared
   differences are used to compare the responses calculated with the
   distributions and with the mean radius. The influence of a distribution
   depends on the velocity, and consequently on the proportion of
   aggregates in situations of local equilibrium or physical
   non-equilibrium. Breakthrough curves calculated from normal
   distributions, whatever their spread, do not differ significantly from
   those calculated using the mean radii, while slightly skewed narrow
   distributions generate significant differences. Thus, the skewness and
   not only the spreading of the distribution seem to modify the spreading
   of solute.
   The problem of using a unique `mean radius' instead of a distribution is
   also considered. It is shown that the problem does not have a simple
   answer. For a given distribution, the existence of an acceptable mean
   radius depends strongly on the contrast between the mobile phase
   residence time and the distribution of characteristic diffusion times.
   Also, intuitively, acceptable mean radii are more easily found for
   narrow distributions. In most cases, it appears that a mean radius
   cannot be used instead of the distribution.
   The analysis of the way the distributions modify the breakthrough curves
   suggests that simple bimodal distributions presenting fast- and
   slow-reacting sites could be used in lieu of complete distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed models of solute transport at the field and catchment scales
   require the specification of effective parameters at the model grid
   scale. The grid scale will generally be much larger than the scale at
   which it is possible to make measurements to derive parameter values but
   may be of the same order as the scale of variability of such `point'
   values. In addition, measurements are usually expensive and time
   consuming to make and where, for example, `undisturbed' soil cores are
   used, may be destructive. This paper describes a conditional probability
   based approach for estimating grid scale effective parameter values in
   the light of expected spatial heterogeneity, given only one or a small
   number of available measurements. Initial results show, somewhat
   surprisingly, that despite the integrative nature of the spatial
   averaging involved in moving to the grid scale, the variance of the
   effective grid element values does not decrease. There is a small shift
   in the location of the distribution, as a result of the macrodispersive
   effect of the grid scale variability.}},

Abstract = {{The potentiality of combining large-scale inverse modelling of
   unsaturated flow with remote sensing determination of areal evaporation
   and areal surface moisture is assessed. Regional latent and sensible
   heat fluxes are estimated indirectly using remotely sensed measurements
   by parameterizing the surface energy balance equation. An example of
   evapotranspiration mapping from northern and central Egypt is presented.
   The inverse problem is formulated with respect to the type of
   information available. Two examples of estimation of soil hydraulic
   properties by the dynamic one-dimensional soil-water-vegetation model
   SWATRE are given: one refers to a classical lysimeter scale and another
   one to a catchment scale. It is concluded that small-scale soil physics
   may describe large-scale hydrological behaviour adequately, and that the
   effective hydraulic parameters concerned may be derived by an inverse
   modelling approach. Remotely sensed data on surface reflectance, surface
   temperature and soil moisture content derived from multifrequency
   microwave techniques provide a useful data set on the mesoscale. The
   inverse modelling approach presented combined with a meso-scale data set
   on evaporation and surface soil moisture, considerable potentialities
   arise to determine effective meso-scale hydraulic properties.}},

Abstract = {{The estimation of model parameters using non-linear regression
   techniques is one of the aspects of inverse modelling and is known as
   the identification problem, the solution of which may be non-unique. The
   main causes of this non-uniqueness are the structure of the model and
   the design of the input signal. It will be shown that the parameters can
   be estimated only if a model with different parameter values yields
   different output signals. A model that has this feature is called
   identifiable. As an example, the identification of a model for the
   movement of water in unsaturated soils is used. This model appears to be
   non-identifiable, which results in non-unique solutions.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrology and hydrochemistry of an acidic moorland catchment is
   described on the basis of the results obtained from field observations
   and intensive sampling of surface water and rainwater during selected
   storm events. At runoff, the prevailing input of soil water of low acid
   neutralizing capacity explains the usually low pH condition of stream
   water (mean pH 4.84). In addition to the high levels of sulphate (up to
   7040 ppb), the chemistry of runoff is dominated by Na (mean 3437 ppb)
   and Cl (mean 6627 ppb). The mean concentrations of Ca (523 ppb) and Mg
   (521 ppb) show the low buffering capacity of the catchment. The main
   short-term effect of storms is a dilution of the pre-storm stream
   concentration of major cations. Only K levels increase at higher flow.
   Despite the flashy runoff, the catchment is capable of delaying stream
   water changes of solute concentration, especially in the case of Cl.
   Although good correlations were found between most cation pairs in
   stream water, a poor correlation was found between Na and Cl. Cation
   exchange mechanisms operating within the organic soil horizons are
   likely to be the main control of surface water chemistry during runoff.
   A chemical separation technique based on the conservative tracer acid
   neutralization capacity is used to separate the hydrograph into `soil
   water' and `deep water' components. It provides a good approximation to
   the hydrochemical processes prevailing during storm episodes.}},

Abstract = {{A new solution satisfying Richards' equation is derived. The solution,
   which may be applied for infiltration or capillary rise, is valid for
   the condition of an arbitrary moisture tension imposed at the soil
   surface. When written in terms of the moisture tension, the new result
   is very simple, being derived in terms of a similarity variable. The
   solution applies when the form of the soil moisture characteristic curve
   is a particular weighted integral of the gradient of the unsaturated
   hydraulic conductivity. Thus, if the soil moisture characteristic curve
   is selected a priori, then this condition determines the hydraulic
   conductivity. The converse of this statement also applies. The
   cumulative infiltration derived from the solution is of the form of the
   Green-Ampt infiltration equation; however, there is no need to assume a
   steep wetting front as Green and Ampt did. Finally, using the
   correspondence between Richards' equation and the convection-dispersion
   equation with a non-linear solute adsorption isotherm, a new exact
   solution for adsorptive solute transport is derived.}},

Abstract = {{A three-component hydrograph separation model involving full
   chemical-isotopic mass balance equations is presented and tested using
   storm runoff and catchment hydrological and hydrochemical data from Allt
   a Mharcaidh catchment in Scotland. A key issue in the use of the model
   is the rational and objective selection of representative end-members
   given spatio-temporal variation in catchment hydrochemistry. In
   addition, a highly involved catchment sampling strategy should be
   adopted so that no key runoff source is omitted.
   End-member mixing analysis was used in determining the set of storm
   runoff end-members used in the model. Results show that incident
   precipitation, soil water and ground water contributed 15\%, 19\%, and
   66\%, respectively, of the June 1989 storm runoff. Maximum instantaneous
   contributions were 26\%, 40\%, and 78\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted during August and early September 1991 in
   the middle of an alfalfa field in Logan, northern Utah. Twenty-minute
   values of climatic factors, including soil heat flux at a depth of 8 cm
   G8 cm and average soil temperature at 2 and 6 cm, were measured using
   the Campbell Scientific CS Bowen Ratio System. Knowing the soil moisture
   content, the values of the surface soil heat flux G(sur) were computed.
   Short term (20 min) evaluations indicated rapid changes of G(sur) vs. G8
   cm It was shown that in addition to solar and net radiations,
   cloudiness, wind speed and direction also affect the surface soil heat
   flux. Statistical analysis showed that daily actual evapotranspiration
   ET(a) (measured on a 20 min basis) could be overestimated up to 41\% if
   G8 cm were used instead of Gu, in the Bowen ratio-energy balance (BREB)
   method. The results indicated that ET(a2)/ET(a1) = 1.154 (based on
   20-min calculations for this experiment). The suffixes 2 and 1 refer to
   the application of Gc. and Gu, in the BREB method, respectively. The
   ratio for potential evapotranspiration ET(p) was ET(p2)/ET(p1) = 0.998.
   This means using the short term G8 cm instead of G(sur) results in an
   overestimated ET(a). For the 24-h computation of ET(p), either G8 cm or
   G(sur) can be used without any serious errors.}},

Abstract = {{A computational algorithm for the solution of prismatic dendritic
   channel networks based on the diffusion wave approximation of channel
   flow is presented. Finite elements are used for the spatial
   approximation and an implicit linear time interpolation scheme is used
   for the temporal discretization of the diffusion wave equations. The
   implicit scheme results in a system of nonlinear algebraic equations,
   which are iteratively evaluated using successive substitution. This
   scheme does not require any system matrix updates of the symmetric and
   banded algebraic equations. A second iteration scheme is used to model
   the network junction point boundary conditions, which allows each
   channel segment to be independently discretized and evaluated.
   This approach significantly reduces the storage and matrix decomposition
   requirements in the solution of a channel network system. An adaptive
   time incrementation scheme, which strives to achieve constancy in the
   number of junction point boundary condition iterations, is presented.
   The model routes a specified set of hydrographs through the channel
   network, as well as any specified lateral inflow into the channel.
   Results are presented for an example of a dendritic network, using
   rectangular and trapezoidal channel geometries.}},

Abstract = {{The estimation of flood quantiles from available streamflow records has
   been a topic of extensive research in this century. However, the large
   number of distributions and estimation methods proposed in the
   scientific literature has led to a state of confusion, and a gap
   prevails between theory and practice. This concerns both at-site and
   regional flood frequency estimation. To facilitate the work of
   `'hydrologists, designers of hydraulic structures, irrigation engineers
   and planners of water resources'', the World Meteorological Organization
   recently published a report which surveys and compares current
   methodologies, and recommends a number of statistical distributions and
   estimation procedures. This report is an important step towards the
   clarification of this difficult topic, but we think that it does not
   effectively satisfy the needs of practitioners as intended, because it
   contains some statements which are not statistically justified and which
   require further discussion. In the present paper we review commonly used
   procedures for flood frequency estimation, point out some of the reasons
   for the present state of confusion concerning the advantages and
   disadvantages of the various methods, and propose the broad lines of a
   possible comparison strategy. We recommend that the results of such
   comparisons be discussed in an international forum of experts, with the
   purpose of attaining a more coherent and broadly accepted strategy for
   estimating floods.}},

Abstract = {{Spatially intensive measurements of streamflow were used to document the
   spatial and temporal variability in streamflow generation on the West
   Fork of Walker Branch Watershed, a 38.4 ha forested catchment in Oak
   Ridge, Tennessee. The study focused on a 300 m section of a small
   stream, and covered a wide range of flow conditions (Q(weir), streamflow
   at the basin outlet, varied from about 350 to 3500 l min-1). There was
   enormous spatial variability in the stream inflow, down to the finest
   scale investigated (reaches 20 m in length). Lateral inflow to longer
   reaches (60-130 m) was linearly correlated with Q(weir) over the full
   range of flows studied, making it possible to estimate the spatial
   pattern of stream inflow from measurement of Q(weir) alone. The
   heterogeneous nature of the karstic dolomite bedrock was the dominant
   control on the observed spatial variability in streamflow generation.
   This thesis is consistent with the results of field investigations using
   natural tracers, reported in a companion paper. Bedrock structure and
   lithology may affect streamflow generation directly (via water movement
   through fractured rock), and indirectly (by influencing the slope and
   thickness of the overlying soil). While the West Fork contains all the
   topographic and surface hydrologic features of larger basins (ridge
   tops, valleys, hollows, spurs, ephemeral and perennial stream channels),
   it covers an area which is relatively small with respect to the bedrock
   heterogeneity. Therefore, while the hydrologic processes observed on the
   West Fork are no doubt typical of those occurring elsewhere in karst
   terrain, the particular patterns of spatial and temporal variability
   observed are somewhat specific to the study site.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of naturally occurring radon-222 (Rn-222) and calcium (Ca)
   in surface and subsurface waters on the West Fork of Walker Branch
   suggest that a simple three-end-member mixing model provides a realistic
   and useful framework for streamflow generation over a wide range of flow
   conditions. The three end members are vadose zone water, soil
   groundwater, and bedrock groundwater. Bedrock groundwater was
   distinguished from the soil end members on the basis of its high Ca
   content; 222 Rn concentration was the basis for the distinction between
   vadose zone water (low Rn-222) and soil groundwater (high Rn-222). The
   behavior of the end members with changing flow was consistent with a
   wide variety of environmental observations, including temperature and
   flow variations at springs, water table responses, the general lack of
   saturated zones on hillslopes and even near the stream in some places,
   and the importance of water movement through bedrock. Variability in the
   chemistry of the end members precluded using other solutes (Na, K, and
   SO4) to test the mixing fractions derived from Rn-222 and Ca data;
   during those times of year when the soil temperature is most different
   from that of the underlying bedrock (late summer and late winter),
   temperature may be a useful tracer for distinguishing between water from
   the soil end members and that from bedrock. The mixing model provides a
   simple framework for analyzing the essential features of streamflow
   generation in this highly heterogeneous terrain.}},

Abstract = {{More than 100 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for
   nitrate-nitrogen, deltaN-15 of the nitrate, dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC), and chloride. Multilevel samplers and nested monitoring wells
   were located beneath and down-gradient from an irrigated cornfield on
   which human waste sludge was injected. The sampling delineated a 1.3 km
   x 0.3 km plume of nitrate contamination. Both the nitrate-nitrogen
   concentrations and the deltaN-15 values within the plume's centroid were
   homogeneous. The levels were 34 +/- 3 mg l-1 and + 13.4 +/- 1.2 parts
   per thousand, respectively. A retarding zone of clayey silt split the
   plume and separated the oxic water from the deeper anoxic water. Nitrate
   levels were lower in the anoxic water and declined rapidly with depth.
   The significant association (r = - 0.91) between increasing deltaN-15
   values and decreasing nitrate concentrations indicated that the nitrate
   was denitrified. High chloride concentrations in the anoxic zone beneath
   the retarding layer are thought to originate from the sludge storage
   lagoon and/or the sludge compost piles. Tritium and atrazine levels
   confirm that this is recent recharge water. Denitrification has utilized
   most of the original nitrate and DOC in the plume.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic conductivity, surface topography and sediment thickness
   influence the spatial and temporal pattern of groundwater flow and
   stream discharge in an unconfined aquifer in a 3.7 ha headwater
   catchment in central Ontario, Canada. Groundwater levels in the soils
   adjacent to the stream also significantly influence the magnitude and
   spatial distribution of stream discharge. Topographic convergence in
   plan and decreasing sediment thickness along flowpaths result in surface
   saturation and groundwater discharge. Hillslope gradients adjacent to
   discharge areas determine how fluctuating groundwater levels influence
   the extent of spatial variations in surface saturation and saturation
   within the soils. As a result of spatial differences in hillslope
   gradients, the spatial patterns of both groundwater and stream discharge
   change with fluctuating groundwater levels. Unsaturated sediments in
   upslope locations store water infiltrating during wet periods such that
   groundwater flow from upslope sediments maintains high groundwater
   levels near the stream and supplies baseflow during dry periods. The
   direction of horizontal groundwater flow in Harp 4-21 is not
   perpendicular to topographic contours so that subcatchment boundaries
   based on topographic divides differ by as much as 57\% from their true
   subcatchment boundaries based on groundwater divides. Therefore,
   groundwater flow models based on surface topography may incorrectly
   predict the spatial pattern of stream discharge.}},

   sites where simulated rainfall was applied to preformed rills. Multiple
   regression analyses were used to relate critical shear stress values and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a study of the hydrological
   consequences of a wildfire in a small Mediterranean basin during the
   first 12 months after the event. The Rimbaud basin is a nested sub-basin
   of the Real Collobrier research and experimental network, which has been
   continuously monitored since 1967. In August 1990, 85\% of its surface
   area was burnt providing an interesting case study to analyse the
   hydrological consequences of fire. Models have been calibrated using a
   23 year period before the fire and they have been used to simulate what
   the response would have been if the wildfire had not taken place.
   Differences between observed and simulated data are analysed, giving
   special importance to the changes in the annual runoff yield and in the
   flood regimes. There is a 30\% increase in the annual runoff yield
   related to the reduction in evapotranspiration due to the destruction of
   the vegetation cover. On the other hand, there are pronounced changes in
   the shape of the flood hydrographs, and the flood frequency is greatly
   increased. The 10-year return period flow estimated before the fire was
   exceeded three times in the year although the rainfall events did not
   exceed the 1-year return period 12 h rainfall. The quantity and quality
   of the data collected during the pre-fire period and the possibility of
   comparing the hydrological responses of similar basins differently
   affected by fire, give a special relevance to this case study.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric General Circulation Models (GCMs) used for climate research
   operate on a resolution of about 250 km and provide outputs averaged on
   a daily and monthly basis. The formation and evaporation of
   precipitation within cloud systems produces large latent heating
   effects. These effects constitute an important source of uncertainty in
   climate and, to a lesser extent, weather-forecasting models. There
   remains a large impact from this uncertainty on the performance of these
   models, produced by inadequate parametrization on scales of around
   100-300 km. Likewise, variations of soil properties and of infiltration
   are not adequately defined at these scales, and therefore it is
   necessary to parametrize these processes. Unfortunately, the
   relationship between rainfall and runoff is highly non-linear, and the
   rate of infiltration will vary throughout a catchment area, making
   parametrization very difficult. Since 1986 the Commission of the
   European Communities (CEC) COST-73 Weather Radar Networking Project has
   encouraged the exchange of weather radar data between the countries of
   Europe. As part of the work undertaken in this project, instantaneous
   radar composite images over NW Europe were generated every hour with a
   grid resolution of about 5 km. Data from radars located in the UK,
   Ireland, France, The Netherlands, Switzerland, and Belgium have been
   used. In the paper we discuss the nature of this database, and consider
   its reliability for estimating daily and monthly precipitation. We
   explore how this database might be used to develop a more effective
   parametrization scheme for surface hydrological processes within GCMs.
   Finally, the adequacy of such a database for continental-scale
   hydrological studies is assessed. It is noted that there is considerable
   scope for further studies of this type using radar data from most
   countries in both Western and Eastern Europe.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed statistical analysis of the morphometry of channel bends
   along the low-energy River Elemi in southwestern Nigeria confirms the
   inherent tendency in rivers to develop sinuous channels with
   asymmetrical bends and compound loops. However, the channel bends differ
   in many respects from those widely reported in the literature. First,
   the parameters have low values because of the characteristic low energy
   to resistance ratio of the intermittent streams. Second, cross-sectional
   and planform properties vary downstream in a non-systematic manner,
   owing to the greater effectiveness of site-specific rather than areal
   factors in controlling the morphology of channel bends in the area.
   Third, the interrelations of bend properties are extremely weak, and the
   patterns of correlations also are different. All these findings indicate
   that the channel bends of the River Elemi are neither true meanders nor
   equilibrium forms. It is doubtful, therefore, if the observed relations
   are of any use in palaeoenvironmental reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{Only a few landfill investigations have focused on both the quantity and
   the quality of leachate as a source of groundwater pollution. The
   investigation of Vejen Landfill in Denmark included an introductionary
   historical survey (old maps, aerial photographs, interviews, etc.),
   leachate quality analysis, potential mapping of the groundwater surface
   below the landfill and leachate flow to surface waters and groundwater.
   The historical investigation showed that the original soil surface
   beneath the waste was a relatively heterogeneous mixture of boggy ground
   and sand soil areas. This indicated that the leaching from the landfill
   could be unevenly distributed. The main specific organic compounds
   observed in the leachate were aromatic hydrocarbons (mainly xylenes),
   phenols and the pesticide MCPP. Preliminary investigations of the leach
   from the landfill indicated, that both a northerly leach to a drainage
   ditch and a southerly leach to the secondary aquifer were taking place.
   To evaluate the proportion of leachate discharging to the drainage
   ditch, piezometers were installed in the shallow leachate-affected
   aquifer. On the basis of several soundings, the groundwater surface was
   mapped and the expected groundwater divides were located. These
   measurements indicated that approximately 50\% of the leachate from the
   mixed waste discharged to the drainage ditch. This was supported by
   directly measuring the flux of leachate (as kilograms chloride per year)
   carried out by continuous gauging of water flow and chloride
   concentrations in the drainage ditch. Wells were driven into the aquifer
   at the borders of the landfill area. These proved that the leaching from
   the landfill was very unevenly distributed. By measurement of present,
   and estimation of the past, leachate quality and quantity, an evaluation
   of the history of leachate recharge to the groundwater is given,
   including time of recharge start and recharge quantities in cubic metres
   and kilograms of chloride per year.}},

Abstract = {{Very-short-range forecasting of precipitation (a few minutes to less
   than 1 h ahead and at a spatial scale of less than 1 km) for
   hydrological purposes is based upon the tracking of the precipitating
   cloud echoes which appear in radar data and the extrapolation of their
   detected motion. We have developed a new forecasting method which
   focuses on tracking high-reflectivity rain cells, which are closely
   related to convective cells. Comparison of our method with three other
   methods (persistence, global extrapolation and the SCOUT II.0 method)
   shows that our method is reliable and generally gives the best relative
   performance, for each event studied.}},

Abstract = {{Daily volumes of runoff from two small watersheds, observed on randomly
   allocated seeded days are compared with volumes observed on unseeded
   days. The comparison is carried out against depths of precipitation at a
   control and over the watersheds. As the cessation of direct runoff lags
   a few days behind that of the rainfall, an assessment of the effect of
   seeding requires a separation of the runoff with respect to
   meteorological days. The separation is carried out by use of the
   exponential decay model. In the present case it is involves a higher
   degree of uncertainty than the conventional separation with respect to
   rainfall events. Therefore, the comparison is limited to the volumes of
   immediate runoff that reach the hydrometric stations on the same days as
   the precipitation. In order to set a yardstick for the effect of
   separation, daily volumes of measured streamflow are compared also. The
   assessment is carried out by use of the double ratio technique (i.e. the
   ratio of mean daily volume for seeded days to mean daily volume for
   unseeded days divided by the ratio of depths of precipitation on these
   days at the control). A linear regression of the flow against the
   precipitation is applied for a few cases where the correlation
   coefficient is higher than 0.6. The results of the two methods are
   positive and close to each other.
   The average rate of enhancememt of the immediate runoff on all runoff
   days is about 65\%, while the rate for days on which runoff series are
   not initiated is about 130\% of the mean value for unseeded days. In
   addition, an enhancement is found in the number of days on which runoff
   is generated. The volume of runoff is found enhanced also with respect
   to the depth of precipitation upon the watersheds. A non-parametric test
   does not indicate a significant difference between the series of seeded
   and unseeded daily volumes. Yet, the results are consistent with those
   obtained earlier for a third watershed in the region, with results for
   annual volumes of springflow and streamflow and with changes observed in
   properties of the precipitation that are related to hydrologic
   processes. Therefore, we conclude that cloud seeding, under the
   conditions that prevailed in northern Israel in the years 1969/1970 to
   1974/1975, enhances generation of direct surface runoff by 50-150\% of
   its value on unseeded days.}},

Abstract = {{A combined hydrological and chemical investigation was undertaken in a
   small moorland catchment at Plynlimon, Mid-Wales, to determine both the
   dominant runoff generation mechanisms and the controls of storm runoff
   chemistry. Natural soil pipes, overland flow from peat soils and
   streamflow were gauged and catchment waters were intensively sampled
   during five storm events. Samples were analysed for total monomeric and
   non-labile monomeric aluminium. The stormflow response appears to be
   dominated by overland flow with a significant contribution from
   pipeflow, particularly during small events. Pipes appear to be the major
   source of Al during storms, and contribute to increased concentrations
   of both organic and inorganic complexes of Al in the stream during high
   flow. However, for a given stream discharge, a wide range of Al
   concentrations was observed. Highest concentrations (maximum 0.477 mg
   l-1) were observed in throughflow from the mineral soil, but the
   contribution of throughflow to stream discharge appears to be limited.
   Al was rarely detected in overland flow. The Al chemistry varied
   considerably between pipe and throughflow water. Al concentrations in
   these waters reflect the availability of Al in pipe and throughflow
   source areas and are not primarily dependent on hydrogen ion content,
   Concentrations in pipe water varied with antecedent conditions; highest
   inorganic Al was observed after a long flow-free period, whereas in very
   wet conditions both inorganic and organic Al became depleted. In
   contrast, the highest concentrations in throughflow were observed after
   the wettest antecedent conditions. The Al-hydrogen ion relationship in
   stream water also showed considerable scatter. Al concentrations in the
   stream reflected contributions from pipeflow and throughflow but were
   greater than the levels suggested by the storm runoff generation
   hypothesis. This indicates that further sources of Al may exist. Organic
   Al is strongly related to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in individual
   events, but there was great variation between events.}},

Abstract = {{Annual periodic temperature variations in spring water and groundwater
   can provide information on the boundaries and properties of shallow,
   thin aquifer systems. Illustrative numerical simulations were carried
   out for four different aquifer systems and then were compared with
   temperature measurements from natural systems.
   Annual temperature fluctuations in the subsurface are characterized by
   the annual amplitude AMP and phase difference DELTAphi with respect to
   the Earth's surface temperature (approximated by the air temperature).
   When periodic surface temperature variations with the amplitude A0 are
   transported by vertical conductive heat flux, then a direct
   interdependence obtains between AMP and DELTAphi independently of
   material properties or other parameters AMP = A0exp(- DELTAphi). Given
   uniform surficial recharge and no other sources of fluid, aquifers of
   constant depth with groundwater flow parallel to the Earth's surface may
   exhibit the same interdependence between amplitude and phase difference.
   A constant-temperature lateral groundwater influx influences annual
   variations in spring water and groundwater temperatures by lowering the
   amplitude (here the phase difference remains constant). Mixing of waters
   with different values of AMP and DELTAphi can be identified and, given
   supplemental information, the mixture ratio can be determined.
   Lateral influx of groundwater from a source with independent annual
   periodic temperature changes occurs in nature in, for example alluvial
   aquifers characterized by bank filtration. The convective heat transport
   from the river into the aquifer causes a phase difference DELTAphi
   between river water and groundwater temperature. There is no direct
   relationship between AMP and DELTAphi. The groundwater temperatures are
   characterized by higher AMP values than those predicted by the
   conductive model. The phase difference of the groundwater may
   approximate to that of the bank filtration component, and bank filtrate
   component and its net residence time in the aquifer can be determined if
   the heat capacity of the aquifer is known.}},

Abstract = {{A streamflow model of a 4800 km2 rural catchment using distributed rain
   inputs and infiltration was set up in a computer. Rain inputs were
   provided in the form of half-hour accumulation maps of real storm events
   collected by radar over southern Quebec. Point sampling of the
   accumulation pattern simulated gauge returns. Interpolation of the
   `gauge' data to complete coverage was accomplished using Thiessen
   polygons. Hydrographs were computed for the interpolated and radar
   accumulation fields as a simple function of distance from the catchment
   outflow point. Ten sampling densities were used, and for each density
   hydrographs were computed for a large number of repetitions with gauges
   redistributed randomly for each realization. Comparisons of estimates of
   total rainfall, total runoff, peak runoff and time to peak between the
   hydrographs resulting from the random sampling and interpolation, and
   that computed from the full resolution radar accumulation field were
   made. As with estimates of areal rainfall we find that gauge density has
   a very strong effect on the estimation accuracy of hydrograph parameters
   with the standard error generally falling off as a power law with

Title = {{THE ROLE OF PERMAFROST AND SEASONAL FROST IN THE HYDROLOGY OF NORTHERN
   WETLANDS IN NORTH-AMERICA}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{5-31}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Wetlands are a common landscape feature in the Arctic, Subarctic, and
   north Temperate zones of North America. In all three zones, the
   occurrence of seasonal frost results in similar surface-water processes
   in the early spring. For example, surface ice and snow generally melt
   before the soil frost thaws, causing melt water to flow into
   depressions, over the land surface, and at times, across low topographic
   divides. However, evapotranspiration and ground-water movement differ
   among the three climatic zones because they are more affected by
   permafrost than seasonal frost. The water source for plants in the
   Arctic is restricted to the small volume of subsurface water lying above
   the permafrost. Although this also is true in the Subarctic where
   permafrost exists, where it does not, plants may receive, and possibly
   reflect, more regional ground-water sources. Where permafrost exists,
   the interaction of wetlands with subsurface water is largely restricted
   to shallow local flow systems. But where permafrost is absent, in parts
   of the Subarctic and all of the Temperate zone, wetlands may have a
   complex interaction with ground-water-flow systems of all magnitudes.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic hydrologic model, specifically designed to assess
   lake-groundwater systems, has been used to provide insight into the
   effects of climatic variability on Wabamun Lake and its watershed, in
   Alberta, Canada. This lake is typical of many lakes in the prairies of
   Canada or western plains of the United States in that groundwater
   exhibits a dominant role in the hydrologic balance of the lake.
   Sensitivity analyses indicate that small changes in temperature
   (1-2-degrees-C rise) or precipitation (5-10\% decline) throughout the
   watershed, may significantly impact upon the quality of the lake water
   and the availability of groundwater resources. Specifically, a long-term
   temperature rise that increases evaporation, or a decrease in
   precipitation, will reduce the amount of water available to recharge the
   groundwater-flow regime. Groundwater storage in the watershed will
   further decline due to continued discharge to the lake. The effect of
   climatic variability on the quantity of water in Wabamun Lake (as
   reflected by its surface elevation) is relatively small. However, the
   salinity of the lake will increase dramatically, due to: (1) the loss of
   surface runoff and direct precipitation, which act to dilute the
   salinity: (2) increased evaporation, which concentrates the salts left
   in the lake water; (3) reduced surface discharge from the lake as its
   surface elevation falls below the elevation of the outlet, which removes
   dissolved mass from the lake.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have shown the important role of groundwater recharge
   and discharge on the geochemical development of salinity in prairie
   wetlands and hydric soils; however, none have focused on the effects of
   transient groundwater mounding on the accumulation and mobilization of
   salts within, and between, wetlands. The present study examines temporal
   variations in the salinity of pondwaters, and near-surface groundwaters
   collected from hydric soil profiles in brackish to subsaline,
   semipermanent North Dakota wetlands, and places these variations in a
   geo-hydrological context. Groundwater samples were collected
   periodically from extractor nests in the peripheral, shallow-marsh zone
   of the wetlands. Pondwaters were collected from locations near each
   extractor nest. Standard methods were used to characterize salinity,
   soil, and the saturation status of calcite and gypsum in pondwater and
   goundwater. All extractor locations had coarse-textured surface sediment
   overlying finer textured subsurface sediments. The electrical
   conductivity of groundwaters collected from extractors in
   coarse-textured surface sediments was usually highest after drawdown and
   steadily declined after recharge events. Groundwaters collected from
   fine-textured subsurface sediments were much less variable in EC
   compared with coarse-textured surface sediments. The greatest variation
   in the saturation status of calcite and gypsum was associated with
   pondwater and groundwater from coarse-textured surface sediments that
   contained little or no observable amounts of these minerals. Zones
   containing identifiable calcite and gypsum were usually saturated with
   respect to these minerals. Zones of gypsum accumulation in particular
   were fine textured and below the level associated with normal seasonal
   water fluctuations. Our results indicate that temporal and spatial
   salinization patterns in near-surface groundwaters and pondwaters are
   dynamic in semipermanent prairie wetlands, and are closely related to
   transient recharge events. Electrical conductivity and gypsum
   distribution patterns in groundwaters and sediments at the extractor
   locations indicate that salt mobilization from the pond edge can be
   rapid and is primarily by lateral groundwater flow through
   coarse-textured surface sediments. Salt accumulation and removal is
   particularly sensitive to the intensity and location of recharge and
   drawdown episodes.}},

Abstract = {{The Miller Woods wetland system contains over 150 individual
   minerotrophic fens. The fens are established in a progradational beach
   complex of relict beach ridges and parabolic dunes and are in hydraulic
   connection with Lake Michigan. Large-scale flow in the wetland system is
   horizontal to the northwest. The position of a ground-water divide which
   forms the southern hydrologic boundary does not coincide with
   geographical boundaries of the system and migrates in time and space.
   The position of the divide is not solely a function of topography, but
   is dependent on an interplay among evapotranspirative demands,
   antecedent soil moisture. and recent recharge. Small-scale, local flow
   systems develop and dissipate on variable temporal scales along the
   margins of individual wetlands in response to evapotranspirative demands
   by wetland vegetation and other climatic influences.}},

Abstract = {{Wetlands between, and within, dune-beach complexes along the south shore
   of Lake Michigan are strongly affected by ground water. The hydrogeology
   of the glacial drift aquifer system in a 26 km2 area was investigated to
   determine the effects of ground water on the hydrology and
   hydrochemistry of Cowles Bog and its adjacent wetlands. The
   investigation showed that ground water from intermediate- and
   regional-scale flow systems discharges to Cowles Bog from confined
   aquifers that underlie the wetland. These flow systems are recharged in
   moraines south of the dune-beach complexes.
   Water from the confined aquifers discharges into the surficial aquifer
   mainly by upward leakage through a buried till sheet that serves as the
   confining layer. However, the till sheet is breached below a raised peat
   mound in Cowles Bog, allowing direct upward discharge from the confined
   aquifer into the surficial sand, marl, and peat. The shallow ground and
   wetland water in the area influenced by this leakage is a calcium
   magnesium bicarbonate type, with low tritium concentrations consistent
   with mixing of older ground water and more recent precipitation Ground
   water and wetland water from surrounding areas are less mineralized and
   have higher tritium concentrations characteristic of precipitation in
   the late 1970s.
   The results of this study suggest that wetlands in complex hydrogeologic
   settings may be influenced by multiple ground-water flow systems that
   are affected by geomorphic features, stratigraphic discontinuities, and
   changes in sediment types. Discharge and recharge zones may both occur
   in the same wetland. Multidisciplinary studies incorporating
   hydrological, hydrochemical, geophysical, and sedimentological data are
   necessary to identify such complexities in wetland hydrology.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrochemistry of small seasonal ponds was investigated by studying
   relations between groundwater and surface water in a forested Coastal
   Plain drainage basin. Observation of changes in the water table in a
   series of wells equipped with automatic water-level recorders showed
   that the relation between water-table configuration and basin topography
   changes seasonally, and particularly in response to spring recharge.
   Furthermore, in this study area the water table is not a subdued
   expression of the land surface topography, as is commonly assumed.
   During the summer and fall months, a water-table trough underlies sandy
   ridges separating the seasonal ponds. and maximum water-table altitudes
   prevail in the sediments beneath the dry pond bottoms. As the ponds fill
   with water during the winter, maximum water-table altitudes shift to the
   upland-margin zone adjacent to the seasonal ponds. Increases in pond
   stage are associated with the development of transient water-table
   mounds at the upland-margin wells during the spring. The importance of
   small local-flow systems adjacent to the seasonal ponds also is shown by
   the similarities in the chemistry of the shallow groundwater in the
   upland margin and water in the seasonal ponds. The upland-margin and
   surface-water samples have low pH (generally less than 5.0), and contain
   large concentrations of dissolved aluminum (generally more than 100 mug
   l-1), and low bicarbonate concentrations (2 mg l-1 or less). In
   contrast, the parts of the surficial aquifer that do not experience
   transient mounding have higher pH and larger concentrations of
   bicarbonate. These results suggest that an understanding of the
   hydrochemistry of seasonally ponded wetlands requires intensive study of
   the adjacent shallow groundwater-flow system.}},

Abstract = {{Dendrogeomorphic techniques were used to describe and interpret patterns
   of sedimentation rates at two forested wetland sites in West Tennessee.
   Fifty-five sampling stations were established along transects upstream
   and downstream from bridge structures, and 515 trees were examined for
   depth of sediment accretion and cored for age determination. Temporal
   variation in sedimentation rate may be related more to stream
   channelization and agricultural activity than to bridge and causeway
   construction. Sedimentation rates have increased substantially in the
   last 28 years, although channelized streams may have overall lower rates
   than unchannelized streams. Comparisons of sedimentation rates from
   deposition over artificial markers (short term) with those determined
   from tree-ring analysis (long-term) indicate that trends are similar
   where hydrogeomorphic conditions have not been altered substantially. No
   tendency for increased sedimentation upstream from bridges was observed.
   Deposition rates were inversely correlated with elevation and degree of
   ponding. Downstream deposition of sand splays appears to be related to
   flow constrictions and may be extensive. Mean overall rates of
   sedimentation (between 0.24 and 0.28 cm year-1) determined
   dendrogeomorphically, are comparable with other published rates.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past several decades, vegetation communities in lowland
   wetlands in Western Europe have changed. Species-rich, low-productivity
   (i.e. low primary biomass production) communities characteristic of rich
   fens (fens characterized by minerophilous species) have declined and are
   being replaced by vegetation communities characteristic of
   high-productivity rich fens, poor fens (fens characterized by
   ombrophilous species) and bogs. High concentrations of calcium in
   groundwater are generally believed to be an important controlling factor
   on the vegetation of rich fens. Management for the protection of
   low-productivity rich fens therefore generally aims at conservation of
   calcareous groundwater conditions in the root zone of lowland wetlands.
   This paper relates the occurrence of calcium-rich groundwater in lowland
   wetlands of the Central Netherlands to water sources and soil conditions
   in the groundwater recharge area. The chemical composition of the
   following groundwater types is compared: groundwater recharged at a
   sandy ridge adjacent to the wetland area (ridge water); groundwater
   recharged by precipitation within the wetland (peat water); groundwater
   recharged by surface water in the wetland. Objective hydrological
   criteria are used to classify groundwater analyses according to recharge
   area. Oxygen-18 proved an essential criterion for the distinction
   between genetic groundwater types. It is therefore recommended to make
   oxygen-18 analysis standard procedure in geohydrological wetland
   research. Calcium concentrations are generally not suitable as tracers
   of different types of recharge areas.
   All groundwater types contain calcium. In contrast to what is generally
   assumed, lowest concentrations are observed in ridge water. Higher
   calcium concentrations are found in groundwater recharged in wetlands,
   especially in infiltrated surface water. Nutrient concentrations in both
   ridge and peat water are low, while those in infiltrated surface water
   are significantly higher.
   The main conclusion for nature conservation is that calcium-rich and
   mesotrophic conditions in the root zone can be realised not only by the
   seepage of groundwater from upland sandy recharge areas, as is generally
   thought, but also by the seepage of peat water. This is important as a
   severe deterioration in the quality of ridge water seeping upward on the
   river plain may be anticipated in the near future. which forms a threat
   to low-productivity rich fens. Peat water may offer an alternative water
   source for the conservation or regeneration of low-productivity rich
   fens. forms at threat to low-productivity rich fens. Peat water may

Abstract = {{Declining water table levels in the Douro River basin, Central Spain,
   are caused by the extraction of groundwater from a relatively
   homogeneous aquifer, and results in several types of impact on local
   wetlands which vary according to their characteristics. These wetlands
   are local, intermediate and regional groundwater discharge sites,
   seepages from post-Tertiary deposits, and non-linked ponds to
   groundwater dynamics. The following important factors influence the type
   of impact: the recharge or discharge nature of the affected sector of
   landscape; the type of connection with the regional aquifer; flow
   lengths and residence time of the water; the interaction between the
   water and the surface material, particularly clay. A wide range of
   wetland values and functions are affected according to the type of
   impact. These include productivity, amenity, recreational, scientific,
   educational and conservation values.}},

Abstract = {{A great percentage of the wetlands in many countries has been destroyed
   over the last century, mainly because of drainage for agricultural
   reclamation. The role of groundwater in the behavior of wetlands has
   usually been recognized in a general way, but there are still few
   studies on the hydrogeology of wetlands.
   The Donana National Park (DNP) is probably the most important National
   Park in the European Community. It is located on the estuary of the
   Guadalquivir River. The functioning of the DNP's ecosystems is closely
   related to the geohydrology of the area. The aquifer system consists
   essentially of unconsolidated Plio-Quaternary materials covering an area
   of 3400 km2. Under the central marshy area (about 1800 km2) the aquifer
   system is confined below low-permeability estuary deposits. Around most
   of the marshland the aquifer crops out and is recharged by rainfall. The
   DNP has an area of 730 km2; part of it is in the marshland and part in
   the recharge area where the aquifer is phreatic. In the 1970s Spain's
   largest irrigation project using groundwater, covering a surface area of
   240 km2, was planned in an area bordering the national park. The initial
   project has been scaled down to 100 km2, mainly as a result of protests
   by conservation groups.
   A review is presented of the various evaluations of the influence of
   groundwater extraction on the functioning of the wetlands. The authors
   consider that the water table decline as a result of pumpage for current
   irrigation could cause a large part of the ecotone - situated at the
   contact-line between the marshland and the phreatic aquifer - to
   deteriorate. This ecotone exists because it is a natural groundwater
   discharge area. The small streams feeding the marshland will also be
   depleted by groundwater extraction. Another significant problem will be
   surface and groundwater pollution caused by agricultural activities.}},
