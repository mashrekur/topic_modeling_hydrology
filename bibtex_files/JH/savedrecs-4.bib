Abstract = {{Seven-year-old pilot-scale landfills were investigated with respect to
   operation of the soil cover, accumulation of water and rainfall-leachate
   Bur relationship. The annual soil moisture fluctuation in the soil cover
   was of the order of 120 mm. Given an average precipitation of 580 mm,
   the net water input into the landfill, split into storage and leachate
   discharge, was on average 250 mm annually. The portion that becomes
   leachate increased from zero to about half during 6.5 years. The storage
   increase was about 180 mm/m during this period. Fair agreement between
   the calculated storage and the moisture content in solid waste samples
   was observed, A 1-2 month time lag in the net water input-leachate
   discharge relation was observed. It is suggested that the observed short
   leachate flux response to a period of infiltration may indicate that a
   large part of the water is retained by surface tension as thin films in
   restricted channels, which is overcome by gravity when the input is
   suddenly increased. The storage-leachate flux relationship was
   quantified and was found to consist of a family of curves depending on
   the storage and the rise or decline of leachate flux. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The decomposition of hydrographs by isotopic analysis has already shown
   that in small Mediterranean catchments an important proportion of storm
   discharge comes from old water. By analysing in detail water movement on
   a hillslope in a subbasin of the Real Collobrier experimental catchment,
   we can explain how such high proportions arise. The hydraulic properties
   of the hillslope soil were measured intensively, and these included the
   texture, porosity and hydraulic conductivity. The hydraulic conductivity
   is found to be very high in the surface layer down to a depth of about
   20 cm. This essentially represents the macropore-ridden portion of at
   least the root zone. Underneath, the conductivity drops off rapidly. We
   have modelled infiltration into this soil, supposing it to comprise two
   layers. In this manner we can simulate the formation of a perched water
   table at the base of the permeable upper layer. In our model,
   groundwater flows are rapidly generated by this perched saturated level.
   By displacement, these flows are considered to consist firstly of old
   water which represents an important contribution to river flow.
   Furthermore, the sharp peaks observed in the discharge hydrograph are
   explained by rapid surface and near-surface flow from these saturated
   zones. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Runoff timing and volume biases are investigated when performing
   hydrologic forecasting at space-time scales different from those at
   which the model parameters were calibrated. Hydrologic model parameters
   are inherently tied to the space-time scales at which they were
   calibrated. The National Weather Service calibrates rainfall runoff
   models using 6-hour mean areal precipitation (MAP) inputs derived from
   gage networks. The space-time scale sensitivity of the Sacramento model
   runoff volume is analyzed using I-hour, 4 x 4 km(2) next generation
   weather radar (NEXRAD) precipitation estimates to derive input MAPs at
   various space-time scales. Continuous simulations are run for 9 months
   for time scalps of 1, 3, and 6 hours, and spatial scales ranging from 4
   x 4 km(2) up to 256 x 256 km(2). Results show surface runoff, interflow,
   and supplemental baseflow runoff components are the most sensitive to
   the space-time scales analyzed. Water balance components of
   evapotranspiration and total channel inflow are also sensitive. A
   preliminary approach for adjusting model parameters to account for
   spatial and temporal variation in rainfall input is presented. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{A method is proposed for estimation of temporal variation of the
   sediment yield for single storm-events in small catchments. The
   kinematic wave equations are used for simulation of overland flow
   whereas continuity equation for sediment and expressions for sediment
   detachment and transport are used to compute the sediment yield. The
   method is based on numerical solution of these equations through a
   non-uniform spatial grid formed by time-area segments of the catchment.
   Carefully collected data of 12 experimental catchments from varying
   climates and ranging in size from 0.002 km(2) to 92.5 km(2) are used for
   calibration and verification of the proposed method. The observed
   sediment yields during the storm events studied hererin varied from
   about 0.003 tonnes to 800 tonnes. The method developed in the present
   study depends on calibration against a record of past conditions.
   Therefore, it can not be used directly to predict the future changes in
   catchment land use or climate. However, the present method can be used
   for estimation of sediment yield in other such ungauged catchments which
   have similar hydro-meteorological conditions and for which other
   information are available. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Localized flow beneath fissures in arid settings has important
   implications for waste disposal in these regions. Fissures are surface
   features or gullies that are underlain by sediment filled fractures. The
   objectives of this study were to compare unsaturated flow beneath
   different fissures, investigate the vertical and lateral extent of
   increased flow associated with fissures, and examine different
   techniques for evaluating flow in zones containing fissures. Boreholes
   were drilled directly beneath four Fissures and at horizontal distances
   of 10 and 50 m from the fissures. Physical parameters such as water
   content and water potential were analyzed in sediment samples and water
   potential was analyzed in plant samples. Environmental tracers such as
   Cl, Cl-36/Cl, H-3, D, and O-18 were analyzed in sediment samples. A
   trench was dug beneath one fissure for detailed sampling.
   Electromagnetic induction was used to measure apparent electrical
   conductivity in transects perpendicular to the fissures.
   Unsaturated flow is relatively higher beneath fissures, as evidenced by
   higher water potentials and lower chloride concentrations there than in
   surrounding sediments. The lateral extent of high water flux was
   restricted to the zone directly beneath one fissure but extended to
   profiles 10 m from two other fissures. The profiles 50 m from all
   fissures had low water fluxes, as indicated by low water potentials and
   high maximum chloride concentrations, The vertical extent of high water
   fluxes was restricted to the upper 10 to 20 m zone, as shown by water
   potential and chloride fronts within the upper IO m zone beneath one
   fissure and by chloride fronts in the upper 20 m zone beneath and 10 m
   from another fissure. Additional evidence for localized water Bur was
   provided by less enriched D and O-18, and higher plant water potentials
   in sediments beneath fissures relative to sediments adjacent to
   fissures. High tritium levels were found in all sampled profiles and
   cannot readily he explained. Apparent electrical conductivity was higher
   in two of the four fissures, Multiple independent lines of evidence
   indicate that subsurface water fluxes are higher at shallow depths
   beneath fissures; however, the various techniques differ in their
   effectiveness in delineating higher water fluxes beneath fissures.
   Multiple profiles drilled in one fissure indicate that there is large
   variability in flow along this fissure that is attributed to topographic
   variations and degree of pending. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Surface cover and soil type have a major influence upon groundwater
   recharge and groundwater quality in agricultural watersheds. However,
   several hydrological models focus on simulating groundwater recharge
   without including the influence of agricultural practices and soil
   characteristics. In this study, ANSWERS, a distributed parameters
   surface nonpoint source model has been modified to include the
   simulation of water transport in the vadose and saturated zones. This
   model takes into account the spatial and temporal variability of crop
   cover and management practices, and the spatial variability of soil type
   and rainfall distribution. It is physically based and uses parameters
   that can be easily determined from readily available soil and plant
   information. It has been validated at multiple scales: local scale,
   field scale and watershed scale. At the local and field scale, it
   predicts accurately drainage below the root zone and evapotranspiration
   on different type of soil cover. At the watershed scale, it reproduces
   well the piezometric levels and trends of variation. (C) 1997 Elsevier

   flank of La Fournaise volcano massif in Reunion island, to study the
   subsurface resistivity structure. One-dimensional modelling of the AMT

   significance of this unexpected conductive substratum is discussed in
   relation with the proposed impact of volcano-tectonic processes (caldera
   and landslides collapses), and a new interpretation of the geological

Abstract = {{In this study, we used a two-dimensional groundwater how model to
   numerically evaluate the single flowmeter test in a series of two-layer
   confined aquifers for a fully penetrating well with a skin zone (i.e. a
   disturbed zone, filter-pack envelope, etc.). The skin zone causes errors
   in estimates of the vertical distribution of horizontal hydraulic
   conductivity by acting as a channel for cross-how between layers of
   contrasting hydraulic conductivity. The bias in measured layer discharge
   rates, Q(i), is dependent on the ratios of the skin zone hydraulic
   conductivity to the layer hydraulic conductivities, K-s/K-i, and on the
   ratios of the skin zone thickness to the thickness of the individual
   layers, (r(s)-r(w))/b(i). For any given K-s/K-i, the cross-how increased
   with increases in the skin zone radius relative to the well radius,
   r(s)/r(w). The error in estimated K-i due to a skin zone of reduced
   hydraulic conductivity (K-s/K-i < 1) is greater than that of a skin zone
   of a correspondingly enlarged hydraulic conductivity (K-s/K-i > 1). As
   K-s/K-1 increases, the ratios (K) over cap(1)/K-1 and (K) over
   cap(2)/K-2 converge approximately to the ranges 0.9-0.95 and 1.0-1.25,
   respectively. As K-s/K-1 decreases from value 1, the ratios of (K) over
   cap(1)/K-1 and (K) over cap(2)/K-2 diverge from these asymptotic ranges.
   In all simulated flowmeter tests, where K-1/K-2 = 10, (K) over cap(1)
   underestimates K-1 and (K) over cap(2) overestimated K-2. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{There is a need to improve rainfall forecasting capabilities for small
   ungaged urban catchments to reduce flooding hazards and pollution
   release. For this purpose, information is required on small-scale and
   short-term convective cell behavior. We use a two-dimensional stochastic
   advection-diffusion model to parameterize the space-time rainfall
   intensity from convective rainfall. The rainfall intensity resulting
   from different separable components of the rain cell. such as apparent
   turbulent diffusion and development/decay of rainfall intensity, is
   quantified for 10 observed and, for southern Sweden, representative
   high-intensity rainfall events. This is Pone following a Lagrangian
   approach. It is shown the used model was able to respond to rapid
   changes in observed rainfall intensity in both space and time, thus
   giving a small average root-mean-square error for all 10 events (0.06 mm
   min(-1)). When dividing the total rainfall intensity into apparent
   turbulent diffusion and development/decay terms, respectively, it was
   shown that D-y,D-center and gamma(center) contribute approximately
   equally to the observed rainfall intensity. The D-x,D-center is usually
   only half the value of D-y,D-center thus indicating less intensity
   contribution from this term and that the general elliptical shape of
   rain cells are elongated in the direction of movement. The observations
   indicate that the cumulus stage represents half and the dissipating
   stage half of the total cell development, respectively. The results can
   be used as first choice of parameter values when modeling rain cell
   movement over ungaged areas and the presented methodology can be used to
   study the effects of different cell components on total rainfall
   intensity. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The moisture content in a rigid soil varies with capillary pressure. On
   the other hand the moisture retention properties of a swelling soil are
   functions of capillary pressure and overburden pressure. An unloaded
   moisture retention curve for a swelling soil can be determined following
   the same laboratory procedures used for the rigid soils. Determination
   of the moisture contents due to combined effects of capillary pressure
   and overburden pressure, however, require a sophisticated experimental
   setup. The present study presents a method to obtain the moisture
   content constitutive surface for a swelling soil as function of
   capillary and overburden pressures by using more easily measured
   unloaded moisture retention curve and consolidation curve. The method
   considers that the moisture ratio contours at the constitutive surface
   can be represented by an ellipse equation. The proposed method was
   compared with laboratory results and found to be acceptable,
   particularly in view of the relative ease of the method. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Field (single-ring infiltrometer) and laboratory (constant head
   permeameter) measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-H) were
   used in combination to examine macropore effects on K-H in shallow
   forest soils in a small basin in southern Ontario, Canada. Soil matrix
   K-H generally decreased with depth for hillslope podzols and stream
   valley gleysols. Differences in average maximum and minimum matrix K-H
   were observed between soil types, with lowest values occurring in the
   valley gleysols. Bulk profile K-H (assumed to include the effects of
   macropores) had no apparent spatial pattern within a given soil type,
   and mean bulk K-H did not differ between soil types. K-H Of macroporous
   soil was similar to matrix hydraulic conductivities for the porous
   hillslope podzols; however, it could be several orders-of-magnitude
   greater than the minimum matrix K-H observed at a given site for the
   gleysols. This difference increased with total profile thickness.
   Geostatistical analyses revealed anisotropic distributions of both bulk
   and matrix K-H in the basin, with the maximum and minimum directions of
   spatial correlation being parallel and normal to the stream valley,
   respectively. Degree of anisotropy and scale of spatial dependence were
   lower for bulk K-H relative to the minimum matrix K-H values. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The French Massif Central has long been recognized as an area with
   numerous mineral water springs. It is often very difficult to measure
   the how rate of mineral springs since they are spread out over extensive
   areas. Water from the Allier River has been sampled monthly over a
   13-month period and a spatial cross-section survey carried out at base
   flow conditions in order to estimate the discharge of mineral water in
   the Allier River streambed.
   For the monthly survey, the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios vary between 0.709511 and
   0.712656. A good correlation exists between Sr-87/Sr-86 and 1/Sr ratios
   and defines binary mixing between mineral waters and the Allier River
   sensu-stricto. The mixing processes have been studied using the Sr
   isotopic systematic and a conservative species (chloride). Except for
   one sample, the mineral water input never exceeds 2\%. However, the
   mineral water discharge into the Allier streambed could not be precisely
   estimated because effluent seepage of mineral water may occur in a part
   of the channel representing only a small volume of the cross-sections.
   Variations in the solute concentrations across the river channel were
   measured at 14 sites chosen as being representative of areas where: (a)
   mineral water emerges, (b) no mineral water emerges, and (c) mixing is
   complete. A model developed for the monthly study using Cl as a
   reference was used in the spatial survey. The input of mineral water in
   the Allier streambed ranges from 0.1-0.15\% in most of the samples and
   is greater than 2\% at two points. The general mass balance of the
   proportions of mineral water and Allier River water (sensu-stricto)
   using the sum of cations and anions was calculated and the input of
   mineral water into the Allier streambed was determined at the
   cross-section nearest the Allier gauging station (0.134\%). The
   discharge of the Allier River at the gauging station was about 17.7
   m(3)/s during the sampling period, which gives a discharge of mineral
   water of about 0.02 m(3)/s into the Allier channel. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The generation of equally likely realizations of transmissivity fields
   conditional to both transmissivity and piezometric data is achieved
   using an iterative technique that couples geostatistics and
   optimization. By conditioning to both transmissivity fields and
   piezometric data we mean that the transmissivity held generated honours
   the transmissivity data and that the solution to the how equation
   reproduces the measured piezometric heads. By equally likely
   realizations we mean that all realizations display the same patterns of
   spatial variability as observed in the field. as opposed to the
   transmissivity fields obtained by interpolation or by inverse modelling
   which are oversmooth, unrealistic. representations of the real field. In
   this regard, any realization could be the real but unknown
   transmissivity field. To achieve this goal, first a transmissivity field
   is generated conditional only to the transmissivity data, then the
   transmissivity field (and possibly the boundary conditions), are
   modified without destroying the spatial patterns of variability of
   transmissivity until the piezometric data are also honoured. The
   methodology is presented for steady-state flow in a confined
   two-dimensional aquifer. The details of the implementation are given for
   finite-differences solution over an aquifer discretized in square

Abstract = {{In the first paper of this series a methodology for the generation of
   transmissivity fields conditional to both transmissivity and piezometric
   head data was presented. This methodology, termed the self-calibrated
   approach, consists of two steps: first, the generation of a seed
   transmissivity field conditioned only to transmissivity data, and
   second, the perturbation of the seed field up until the piezometric head
   data are reproduced. The methodology is now demonstrated on a set of
   controlled numerical experiments carried out on synthetic aquifers. The
   objective of these experiments is not just to show that the methodology
   works, but also to explore its robustness under different situations. A
   total of 12 experiments have analyzed the performance of the method as a
   function of: (i) the log(10) T transmissivity variance (from 0.2 to
   2.0); (ii) the number of log(10) T conditioning data (from 10 to 30);
   (iii) the number of piezometric head data (from 30 to 90); (iv) the
   number of master points (from 25 to 1000); (v) the magnitude of allowed
   departure of the final T field from the seed field (up to four times the
   kriging standard deviation). In all cases, the method was able to
   generate transmissivity fields conditional to both transmissivity and
   head measurements, at the same time preserving the spatial variability
   of the transmissivity field. It was found that the performance of the
   method increases with both the number of log(10) T data and the number
   of master points, whereas it decreases as either the log(10) T variance
   or the number of piezometric head data increases. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Sustainability studies are increasingly needed to determine management
   systems that protect the environment and maintain production potentials.
   Whether these analyses are performed by field experiments or by computer
   modelling, defining the appropriate spatial and temporal scales is
   essential. For three management types within one soil series in The
   Netherlands, the land quality indicator ``transpiration ratio{''},
   E-ratio (ratio between actual and potential transpiration), was
   determined using a simulation model of water flow in the unsaturated
   zone. Soils were characterised by eight profiles per management type in
   which measurements of the retention and hydraulic conductivity
   characteristics were made. Variation in weather data was described by 30
   years of historical data. Soil hydraulic characteristics were used as
   individual data and as averaged data. Differences in E-ratio obtained by
   using individual soil data rather than averaged data were not
   significant, but E-ratio values for the three management types were
   significantly different (0.79, 0.81 and 0.83). The results of the 30
   years were used to analyse the effect of the time over which an
   experiment is evaluated, on the E-ratio. The differential of variance
   indicated that the length of an experiment should be at least seven
   years in order to reduce the effect of the variable weather conditions.

Abstract = {{We present power spectra of time-series data for tree ring width
   chronologies, atmospheric temperatures, river discharges and
   precipitation averaged over hundreds of stations worldwide. The average
   power spectrum S for each of these phenomena is found to have a
   power-law dependence on frequency with exponent -1/2: S(f) proportional
   to f(-1/2). An advection-diffusion model of the vertical transport of
   heat and water vapor in the atmosphere is presented as a first-order
   model of climatic and hydrological variability. The model generates
   variability with the observed spectrum. The model is validated with a
   correlation analysis of temperature and water vapor concentration
   measurements from the TIROS operational vertical sounder (TOVS). Drought
   frequency analyses based on synthetic lognormal streamflows with the
   above power spectrum are presented. We show that the presence of long
   memory as implied by the power-law power spectrum has a significant
   effect on the likelihood of extended droughts compared with the drought
   hazard implied from standard autoregressive models with short memory.

Abstract = {{The groundwater contribution into Par Pond, a former cooling reservoir
   for two nuclear reactors located on the Department of Energy's Savannah
   River Site (South Carolina), was estimated using a standard hydrologic
   budget as well as one augmented by a natural tracer approach. We
   determined a geochemical budget for Rn-222, normally found at much
   higher concentrations in groundwater than surface waters, to assist in
   constraining the hydrologic estimates. The radon budget accounted for
   all quantifiable surface sources and sinks including the flux across the
   sediment-water interface which was determined by application of an
   advection-diffusion model.
   All hydrologic parameters and radon concentrations were monitored
   seasonally from February 1994 to August 1995. Using the water balance
   approach alone, the average groundwater discharge entering the lake was
   estimated to have an upper limit of approximately 0.95 +/- 0.13 m(3)
   s(-1). The groundwater contribution obtained using the combined
   hydrologic/Rn-222 approach ranged from 0.17 to 0.76 m(3) s(-1) with a
   best estimate of 0.35 +/- 0.16 m(3) s(-1). Lake profiles show enhanced
   Rn-222 concentrations in some areas indicating that groundwater enters
   Par Pond mostly through a small region in the northern portion of the
   lake, probably via small seeps or springs. Estimates show that
   groundwater plays a significant role in the overall water budget of the
   lake, accounting for 10\%-33\% of the total estimated inflow from all
   measured sources. Our results show that supplementing a standard
   hydrological water balance with radon budget considerations helps to
   constrain estimated groundwater flow into surface reservoirs. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Mass-balance calculations were used to quantify reactive transport
   processes and cation exchange in a plume of groundwater contaminated
   with septage-effluent wastewater on Cape God, Massachusetts. Of the
   chloride mass recharged to the aquifer in effluent, as much as 72\% was
   accounted for using spatial moment analysis and finite-element
   integration of groundwater concentrations, which were sampled at less
   than or equal to 69 wells and supplemented by borehole
   electromagnetic-induction logging. Comparison of chloride transport and
   mass balances with transport and mass balances of other species
   indicated that reactive processes substantially altered concentrations
   of all major chemical constituents. Calcium in effluent was exchanged
   for magnesium on aquifer sediments. Potassium also was attenuated,
   possibly through exchange with magnesium, sodium, and/or hydrogen ions.
   Sufficient hydrogen ions were generated by microbial nitrification in
   the unsaturated zone to consume effluent alkalinity and lower the
   effluent pH from 7.2 to 5.0 in the recharged groundwater; the resultant
   acid conditions may have facilitated anion adsorption and
   silicate-mineral dissolution. Retardation factors (R) calculated from
   breakthrough curves indicated that calcium (R = 1.4-2.2) and boron (R =
   1.3-2.1) were similarly retarded, whereas potassium experienced greater
   retardation (R = 1.8-5.2). Retardation of calcium, boron, and potassium
   was greater in the unsaturated zone than in the saturated zone; this may
   have resulted from spatial heterogeneity in exchange properties and
   preferential saturated-zone How through coarse-grained sediments not
   present in the unsaturated zone. Although concentrations may stabilize
   and chemical reactions reach equilibrium at fixed points along paths in
   the Flume, the mass-balance analysis illustrated that steady-state
   conditions will not be established throughout the aquifer and the
   cumulative mass of reacted constituents in the plume will increase until
   the plume reaches its discharge area. The analysis also indicates that
   retrospective study of dissolved concentrations in an established plume
   after many years of transport may not identify reactive transport and
   attenuation of plume constituents, if precise data on source
   concentrations (or masses) and the spatial distribution of solutes
   during plume development are not available. Finally. transport of the
   effluent-contaminate groundwater also altered the geochemistry of the
   aquifer, for example, through cation exchange, such that the
   introduction of clean, uncontaminated water into the aquifer will not
   immediately restore pre-plume conditions. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrological response of rain-on-snow events has been studied on a
   plot scale at 2640 m altitude in the Austrian Alps. Three artificial
   rain events with different intensities and durations were simulated over
   two snow plots on a natural snowpack and the behaviour of emerging
   outflow was examined. Measurements of meteorological parameters, soil
   temperature and snowpack properties were also made. The investigations
   show that the impeding characteristics of the ice layers more than
   doubled the storage capacity of the snowpack. The speed of water
   movement was estimated to be about 6 m h(-1) when the snow pack was
   fully saturated. Accelerated metamorphism under saturated conditions and
   preferential Bow paths created owing to uneven snow surface caused by
   the impact of intense rain over the snow surface, are understood to be
   responsible for the high speed of water flow. This indicates that heavy
   rain water moves several times faster than the natural snowmelt under
   non-rainy conditions. Moreover, under rainy conditions, natural snowmelt
   also percolates faster along with rain water. Observations of the time
   of arrival of runoff, t(a) and time to equilibrium concentration of
   liquid water in snow, t(e), for different rain events indicate that
   after conditioning of the snowpack, a significant reduction of rain
   intensity (by half in the present study) is not able to change the
   distribution of runoff much; fast response of water was also observed
   under reduced rain-intensity. Another important aspect of the snowpack
   worth noting was that most of the input appeared as runoff. This stage
   of snowpack with high conductivity is found to be responsible for the
   production of high streamflows. Heavy rain either with snowmelt or alone
   can generate floods under such conditions. The importance of the role of
   rain water in conditioning the snowpack to yield maximum and fast runoff
   is due much more to input rather than to rain-induced snow melt. (C)

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the hydrological conditions in a harvested bog
   where various water management schemes have been implemented to
   ameliorate conditions limiting Sphagnum regeneration. The study sites
   included a natural bog (natural), a recently drained and harvested bog
   (drained), which provided the hydrological extremes. Also included are a
   drained harvested bog with ditches blocked with (1) no other management
   (blocked), (2) peat bounded by open water at 5-m intervals (5-m), and
   (3) with straw mulch on the surface (mulch).
   The study period from May to September 1995 was drier than normal. The
   water table in the drained site descended to -107 cm by late August,
   compared with -72.5 cm at the blocked site. Both the 5-m and mulch sites
   (ditches also blocked) had water table recessions similar to the natural
   site (minimum approx. 62 cm). In the drained and blocked sites, little
   variation in water table depth occurred after early July, suggesting
   water exchanges with the atmosphere occurred to and from the unsaturated
   zone only. Soil moisture in the upper 3 cm layer on the drained and
   blocked site were similar, in spite of greatly different water table
   depths, dropping below 20\% by volume, compared with a minimum of 30\%
   when mulch was used. Soil water tension profiles suggest most of this
   storage change occurred in the upper 30 cm. The water table depth,
   therefore, was not a good indicator of water availability at the
   surface.
   Pressure head in the unsaturated zone (1 cm below the surface) in the
   drained and blocked sites was maintained between 0 and -100 cm (mb) 18
   and 34\% of the time, respectively, and with water management with open
   water (5-m) and mulch, increased to 55 and 97\% of the time,
   respectively. The greatest tension, however, was observed on the blocked
   site (-355 cm), rather than the drained site (-247 cm), suggesting lower
   suitability for Sphagnum at the former. This was attributed to the
   higher bulk density (hence smaller pore structure) at the blocked site
   (rho(b) = 92.1 kg compared with 55.7 kg m(-3)). Higher bulk density at
   the blocked site was ascribed to its longer time since disturbance. This
   implies' restoration should begin as soon as possible after harvesting
   is finished. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A simple potential flow model is developed for airflow over low hills.
   The model readily allows incorporation of simple rain microphysics so
   that drop trajectories can be traced in the region of a hill complex.
   Rainfall intensity variations are found in the horizontal and in the
   vertical, and a straightforward modification to the model allows for
   time dependence to be studied.
   The model is shown to serve as a useful diagnostic tool to describe rain
   drop redistribution due to perturbed airflow. In particular, increased
   rainfall is predicted in the lee of hill peaks and depleted rainfall is
   predicted on ridges. The redistribution effects dominate at low levels,
   in contrast to predictions based on seeder-feeder enhancement.
   Comparison with field measurements shows good qualitative agreement over
   low hills and, in some cases, close quantitative agreement.
   Redistribution of rain appears to be a significant process that should
   be considered in rainfall interpolation and prediction schemes involving
   hilly terrain. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{An adaptive combination of field mapping, simple hydrologic monitoring,
   and hydrologic modeling was used to describe the hydrologic behavior of
   two zero-order catchments: one undeveloped forest, the other suburban.
   Field mapping was used to delineate hydrologic process zones and provide
   guidance for the location of monitoring stations. Hydrologic monitoring
   included continuous streamflow and precipitation, as well as limited
   piezometer information. The hydrologic model was developed in
   conjunction with the measurement program to assure that the level of
   model detail was consistent with the level of field measurements used
   for model input and testing, At the start of the work it was anticipated
   that saturation overland flow would drive peak discharge in the forested
   catchment and Horton overland Bow from impervious surfaces would
   dominate storm runoff in the suburban catchment, Instead, subsurface
   flow was found to dominate both annual and peak discharge in the
   forested site, and discharge from lawns and other pervious areas
   accounted for roughly 60\% of annual and storm runoff from the suburban
   catchment, The adaptive combination of modeling and measurements was
   essential to elucidate the various components of Row production and flow
   paths in these catchments. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The water table height in drained agricultural land depends on
   time-varying replenishment that is due to the vertical downward recharge
   from irrigation or rainfall, and in some cases to the upward vertical
   leakage from a semi-confined aquifer. The downward recharge may be
   assumed to vary exponentially with time, whereas the upward leakage may
   be expressed as a function of the unknown water table height.
   Furthermore, the rising of the water level in the field drainage system,
   that may cause an inverse how from the drains towards the soil, is
   introduced through a properly defined boundary condition, A
   non-homogeneous form of the Boussinesq equation, that is used to
   describe this particular drainage problem, is solved for three different
   initial conditions. The same drainage problems were solved numerically
   by using the finite element method. Comparison between analytical and
   numerical solutions shows satisfactory agreement. From the analytical
   solutions we obtain the non-dimensional water table height at the
   midpoint between the drains, and the nondimensional discharge of the
   drains per unit drained area, as functions of non-dimensional time and
   constants describing the aforementioned drainage conditions, Variation
   of these functions has also been illustrated graphically in
   non-dimensional diagrams; these can be used to show the sensitivity to
   various sets of parameter values and to calculate easily the water table
   height and the drain discharge in practical problems. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Infiltration rates in frozen soil may be extremely low due to pore
   blockage by ice, leading to accelerated runoff and erosion. It is
   difficult to test models of ice blockage effects during infiltration of
   water because both infiltrating water and resident ice undergo phase
   changes. We used air permeability, which can be measured without phase
   changes, to test the applicability of currently used soil hydraulic
   models to the simulation of ice blockage effects. We confirmed that
   Darcy's equation described air flow for both dry and moist soil
   conditions. It was then shown that a combination of the van Genuchten
   soil-water retention equation (M.Th. van Genuchten, Soil Sci. Sec. Am.
   J., 44 (1980) 892) and Mualem's (Y. Mualem, Water Resour. Res., 12
   (1976) 513) hydraulic conductivity model, modified to account for the
   presence of trapped air, described the air permeability of unfrozen
   soils over a range of soil-water contents. However, when this model was
   extended to frozen soils, the measured reduction in air permeability in
   frozen soil was much greater than the model predicted. It appears that
   hydraulic models can be used to describe the conductivity of the
   air-filled porosity but that processes other than expansion of water
   when frozen, possibly internal redistribution of water, affect the
   conductivity of the air-filled porosity. Until freezing processes are
   better understood, calculations of infiltration based on soil water
   content alone are subject to large errors. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the applicability of three versions of the
   Bartlett-Lewis rectangular pulses model of temporal rainfall for the
   calculation of design storms. We consider the original model, the
   modified model (developed in order to improve the zero depth
   probability) and the modified gamma model. This last model was recently
   suggested by Onof and Wheater {[}Onof, C. and Wheater, H.S., J. Hydrol.,
   157 (1993) 177-195] to improve the representation of extreme rainfall
   events. The data set used here is 27 years of 10 min rainfall records
   observed at Uccle (Belgium) between 1967 and 1993. First, the
   performance of the three models to preserve first-and second-order
   moments is evaluated. Overall, the modified Bartlett-Lewis model fits
   best the observed time series. Then, the models are applied to
   extrapolation of data sets for extreme value frequency analysis of
   rainfall in order to improve estimates of design intensities for return
   periods up to 100 years. For the data used here the modified
   Bartlett-Lewis gamma model does not produce the expected result: an
   improved representation of extreme rainfall events is not observed,
   Finally, interstorm variability, important in design storm selection, is
   analyzed based on time distribution behavior during heavy storms. It is
   found that all three models represent reasonably well the internal storm
   structure, but that the average storm duration is underestimated. (C)

Abstract = {{Floodplains mitigate against extreme annual hydrologic phenomena by
   storing substantial volumes of water which would otherwise increase hood
   volumes. Later floodplains gradually release this water which serves to
   maintain baseflows. This phenomenon, called bank storage, has important
   physical and ecological ramifications which in addition to reducing
   flood peaks, include sustaining riparian vegetation and improving water
   quality. We developed a model of bank storage based upon the earlier
   work of Neuman and Witherspoon (Wat. Resour. Res., 6 (1990) 889, 1376; 7
   (1971) 611). This model (WaTab2D) treats the flow of water through
   floodplain soils for a general two-dimensional case: non-symmetrical
   valleys, non-symmetrical channel banks, non-uniform hydraulic geometry
   and non-zero boundary fluxes. The total volume that can potentially be
   released from bank storage is nearly proportional to the width of the
   floodplain, the height of the bank, and the specific yield; the duration
   over which water is released from bank storage increases with increasing
   floodplain width and decreases with hydraulic conductivity. Drainage of
   water from the floodplain with a drop in channel water level occurs over
   a period of days in gravel, weeks to a few years in sand, years in silt,
   and decades in clay. The rate of drainage decreases in an
   exponential-like manner. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate knowledge of soil hydraulic properties is of crucial importance
   for reliable applications of recently developed distributed models to
   environmental studies and land-use planning. To provide such information
   in a cost-effective way, indirect estimation of water transport
   parameters from easily measurable or already available soil data using
   pedo-transfer functions (PTFs) is becoming increasingly popular.
   However, distributed hydrological modeling requires that soil hydraulic
   characterization also takes account of the description of spatial
   variability.
   The objective of this study was to evaluate some published PTFs in the
   light of their ability to quantify the spatial structure and variability
   of soil water retention adequately. Four PTFs were tested: two provided
   only values of water content at specific pressure potentials (PTF Group
   A), whereas the remaining two estimated the parameters of closed-form
   relations describing the water retention function (PTF Group B).
   Measured data for testing were obtained from undisturbed soil samples
   taken from the top layer of different soils along a 5 km transect with
   constant spacing of 50 m.
   Overall, summary statistics and sample distributions of the
   PTF-estimated retention characteristics at selected pressure potentials
   are close to those of the retention variables used as reference for
   comparisons. The largest discrepancies are related to the use of PTFs
   pertaining to Group A. Although the quality of kriged interpolations
   based on soil property data obtained by simplified methodologies still
   gives cause for concern, results show that the structure of spatial
   variability exhibited by the variables considered along the study
   transect is described well enough when using PTFs for determining soil
   water retention characteristics. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{TOPMODEL (Beven and Kirkby, 1979; Beven et al., 1995) was one of the
   first attempts to model distributed hydrological responses based on
   variable contributing area concepts. It makes use of an index of
   hydrological similarity based on an analysis of the topographic data.
   The index approach was later generalised to take account of spatial
   variability of soil transmissivities, but no similar spatial analysis of
   the variability in the rate of the decrease of the transmissivity with
   depth has yet been examined. This paper shows how the TOPMODEL theory
   can be extended to handle this spatial variability, using a 2D
   distribution function of a new soil depth-topographic index of
   hydrological similarity, A first sensitivity analysis of the effect of
   variable soil depths on the model predictions for the Maurets catchment,
   France, is presented, Predicted discharges and calibrated parameter
   values are not sensitive to the patterns of effective soil depth
   investigated. Distributed predictions may be more sensitive but raise
   questions of how to obtain the parameter data required. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{In the context of changing environment, and specifically a possible
   climate change, a river flow regime type turns from being a merely
   general, average, descriptive characteristic to a tool for monitoring
   changes in Bow seasonality both in time and space. Utilization of river
   Bow regimes as a diagnostic tool for the output of climate models and in
   flow sensitivity studies demands an objective grouping of Bow series
   into regime types. A hierarchical aggregation of monthly Bow series into
   flow regime types, satisfying chosen discriminating criteria, is
   effectively performed by means of minimization of an entropy-based
   objective function. This function is based on the concept of an
   `information loss' resulting from such an aggregation and describes the
   difference between the series aggregated into one group, i.e. inaccuracy
   of aggregation. The main advantage of the approach, operating on river
   flow series for individual years (and not only on long-term means), is
   its ability to consider also the temporal regularity of the seasonal
   flow patterns, neglected, as a rule, in other approaches. Meanwhile,
   both flow volumes and seasonal patterns of Bow are sensitive to climate
   fluctuations. A strict formulation of the `stopping rules' in the
   hierarchical flow regime grouping, directly related to the aggregation
   principles, is suggested. The approach allows different formulations of
   criteria for discriminating flow regime types. It is illustrated on a
   regional river flow sample for Scandinavia for two different
   formulations of discriminating criteria. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that correlated, random permeability fields with
   user-specified values of desired statistical properties can be
   constructed in the laboratory. Two columns were each packed wet with 101
   5-cm layers of ordered, sieved sand whose permeabilities were
   individually measured prior to packing. The ordering of 13 size classes
   of sand in each column was determined by sampling a numerically
   generated random field, sorting the numerical data into bins having
   bounds defined by the geometric means of adjacent size-class
   permeabilities, and assigning the bin size-dass permeability value to
   the spatial locations associated with the numerical data collected in
   each bin. The insitu permeabilities of the layers of the packed columns
   were obtained using a 102-port, constant-head permeameter setup. The
   calculated means (-13.6 for both columns), variances (0.26 and 0.98),
   and negative-exponential-variogram correlation scales (17 cm for both
   columns of the in-situ natural-log-permeability fields agreed well with
   the target statistics that had been used to generate the numerical
   random field, The variance of observed hydraulic head as a function of
   distance along each column was calculated for several volumetric flow
   rates. The scaling of the head variance data to the statistics of the
   permeability field agreed well with stochastic theoretical predictions
   for one-dimensional bounded domains. Although head observations in
   saturated Bow are reported here, the experimental vessels could be used
   to observe unsaturated Bow as well as mass transport processes, and
   furthermore can be extended to more realistic two-and three-dimensional
   permeability fields. The methodology offers value in allowing an
   investigator to (I)carefully control selected physical variables (e.g.,
   flow direction, temperature, chemical reactions) while observing a
   phenomenon of interest in a heterogeneous permeability setting
   statistically similar to that which has been shown to be characteristic
   of a number of field sites, and (2) control and quantify the statistics
   of the permeability field needed as inputs for predictive stochastic
   models. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations were carried out to investigate the so-called
   Noordbergum effect (i.e. reverse water-level fluctuation) resulting from
   groundwater withdrawal. Two specific cases were analyzed: a three-layer
   aquifer system composed of two permeable aquifers separated by a
   semi-impermeable aquitard, and a corresponding single-layer aquifer
   system composed of an equivalent lumped material, In the numerical
   simulation of the layered aquifer system, the Noordbergum effect is
   observed during the early time period of pumping in the overlying
   aquitard and unpumped aquifer while the underlying aquifer is pumped. In
   contrast, the numerical simulation results of the lumped aquifer system
   do not show such a reverse water-level fluctuation throughout the entire
   domain. These results strongly suggest that the Noordbergum effect can
   be explained by the difference in poroelastic responses of the layered
   (heterogeneous) and lumped (homogeneous) aquifer systems to the
   hydraulic pumping stress. The Noordbergum effect is caused by two
   mechanisms: a faster mechanical propagation (deformation) of the pumping
   stress than its hydraulic propagation (drawdown) from the pumped aquifer
   into the adjacent aquitard and unpumped aquifer due to relatively lower
   hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard, and a mechanical amplification
   (excessive compression) in the lower part of the relatively soft
   aquitard. However, the pumping stress is evenly distributed throughout
   the entire domain of the lumped aquifer system without such mechanisms
   since it has homogeneous hydraulic and mechanical properties. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Structural and hydrodynamic characteristics of karst aquifers are mostly
   deduced from studies of global responses of karst springs (hydrographs,
   chemical or isotopic composition). In this case, global response is
   often used to make inferences with respect to infiltration and ground
   water How processes as well as on the hydrodynamic parameters.
   Obviously, the direct verification of these inferences is very
   difficult. We have used an indirect method of verification, introducing
   well defined theoretical karst structures into a finite element model
   and then analysing the simulated global response according to the
   currently accepted interpretation schemes. As we know what we are
   introducing into the numeric model, the consistency of the
   interpretation may be checked immediately. The results obtained in the
   hydrogeological study of two karst basins in the Swiss Jura and from 2-D
   and 3-D numerical simulations show the difficulty of finding structural
   parameters and hydrodynamic behaviour from statistical methods alone,
   i.e. correlation analyses discharge-discharge and
   precipitation-discharge. In effect, our first results show that the form
   of the correlograms depends on several factors besides the structure of
   the karst aquifer: (i) on the form of the floods. in other words the
   contrast between quick Row and base How, (ii) on the frequency of
   hydrological events during the period analysed and (iii) on the type of
   infiltration processes, in other words the ratio of diffuse infiltration
   to concentrated information. Obviously, the variability of a karst
   hydrograph is a result of a combination of these factors. Distinction
   between them is not always possible on hydrographs, and therefore on
   correlations (discharge-discharge and precipitation-discharge). (C) 1997

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the possible effects of climate change on four
   hydrologic variables pertaining to the magnitude and timing of
   hydrologic events within the Churchill-Nelson River Basin in
   west-central Canada. By using the Mann-Kendall trend test, and a
   regionalization procedure, the severity of climatic effects within the
   river basin may be quantified and used to increase awareness of future
   consequences for water resource systems planning and management
   strategies. It was found that the magnitude of hydrologic events
   decreased over time while snowmelt runoff events occurred earlier. The
   only exceptions to this behavior were the spring mean monthly streamflow
   values which exhibited increasing trends due to the potential for snow
   melting during this period, The timing of a hydrologic event was found
   to be influenced to the greatest extent by changes in temperature.
   Geographically, the decreasing trends were concentrated in the southern
   regions of the river basin while the increasing trends appeared
   primarily in the northern regions. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional finite element model is developed to simulate
   density-dependent now of saltwater in variably saturated media. The Bow
   and solute equations were solved in a coupled mode (iterative), in a
   partially coupled mode (non-iterative), and in a completely decoupled
   mode. Pressure head was considered as the dependent variable in the
   fluid motion equation, and a backward Euler scheme with mass lumping was
   used for time discretization of both flow and transport equations. The
   modified Picard method was used in the Bow equation to solve for
   pressure heads. The model was verified by comparison to an analytical
   test function and published numerical results. It was found that density
   effects on the Bow decreased with the pressure head. However,
   significant effects can still be observed at relatively low (negative)
   pressure heads. The density dependence effects were st their maxima at
   steady state. Partial coupling of the flow and transport equations was
   shown to give satisfactory results in comparison with full coupling. The
   advantage in partial coupling is a reduced amount of numerical
   computation. The finite element formulation of the model is presented in
   a form that allows a person with finite difference expertise to
   implement it easily. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A new form of the momentum equation has been derived in order to solve
   the Saint Venant's equations for hood routing in rectangular open
   channels with constant width. In this new formulation, the momentum
   equation transforms to a partial differential equation which has two
   parameters related to cross-sectional area and discharge of the channel.
   This simplified dynamic model has been solved by using an explicit
   finite difference scheme in which the operator is in the form of a
   tiling diagram. In computation procedure, after computing the discharge
   from the momentum equation, the cross-sectional area will be obtained
   from the continuity equation for a given point of the channel. The
   numerical algorithm used in the model is a simple one of a cascade type.
   The results are compared with the solution of general dynamic model
   which was selected from the literature. The comparison shows that there
   is a good agreement between the results of the simplified dynamic model
   and those of the general dynamic model. However the simplified model is
   more easy to formulate and simple to compute than that one. In addition,
   the solutions of the simplified dynamic method for a hood routing
   problem are compared with the solutions of kinematic method. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Groundwater underlying the Perth metropolitan area was found to be
   contaminated by extensive plumes of trichloroethene (TCE), ammonium and
   sulphate, and regions of high dissolved organic carbon concentration. At
   the study site, approximately 600 m downgradient of the presumed source
   area, depth-specific sampling in the vertical plane across the plumes
   showed TCE concentrations up to 1300 mu g L-1, and ammonium and sulphate
   concentrations up to 90 and 470 mg L-1, respectively. The plumes were
   approximately 100-150 m wide and between 3-9 m thick. No significant
   degradation of TCE was observed. Also, depth-specific sampling suggests
   that separate TCE plumes are present within the shallow aquifer, which
   may be indicative of multiple TCE sources. Depth-specific sampling
   enabled a better definition of the plumes which is important for
   possible risk analysis or remediation. To determine the transport
   characteristics of the TCE plume, a natural gradient field transport
   experiment using deuterium labelled TCE (TCEdl) and bromide was carried
   out over a displacement distance of 13 m. TCEdl was stable and
   non-retarded. No in situ transport experiment making use of deuterated
   TCE has been reported previously. Also, no previous field experiment has
   shown TCE to move conservatively. Modelling of the field transport
   experiment indicated a longitudinal dispersivity of 0.005 m which is the
   lowest longitudinal dispersivity ever reported for the scale of the
   experiment (i.e. for a vertical interval of 0.8 m and a horizontal
   distance of 13 m). Although not measured, the vertical transverse
   dispersivity is expected to be less than the longitudinal dispersivity.
   The aquifer at the site, therefore, is characterised by exceptionally
   little heterogeneity. Na aquifer, however, is homogeneous, and the
   tracer experiment revealed the aquifer to be hydraulic conductivity
   stratified. The data suggest that the longitudinal dispersivity,
   estimated from depth integrated concentrations, will increase with both
   the vertical and the horizontal scale and is not expected to approach a
   constant value. Hydrogeological investigations indicated that horizontal
   transverse spreading of the plume was negligible since annual variations
   in the flow direction (+/-3 degrees) were minor. Therefore, any
   significant transverse spreading of the plumes must result from
   disturbances of the mean advective flow (e.g. due to localised recharge
   or extensive pumping). These effects are site-specific. preventing the
   use of generalised dispersion coefficients. Together with the results of
   the transport experiment. these data indicate that TCE within the
   acquifer moves as a conservative compound. is highly mobile, and that
   high concentrations will be preserved to substantial distances
   downgradient of the source areas. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{To investigate the influence of chemical fertilizers on drinking water
   neighboring tea plantations in Kyushu, Japan, time series of chemical
   concentrations and nitrogen isotopic ratios within local ponds were
   studied. Results indicated that the main dissolved components of spring
   and river water originating from a tea plantation catchment were Ca2+,
   Mg2+, NO3-, and SO42-. Furthermore, pH values were below 7 due to
   plantation soil enrichment using nitrogen fertilizers and calcium and
   magnesium carbonates. Although acidic spring water flowed into a local
   pond, the pH value of the pond water remained mostly above 7.
   Occasionally, excessive spring water influx after heavy rains caused the
   pond water pH to dip below 7. The pond water showed temporal variations
   of pH ranging over 4 orders of magnitude within a 3-4 month period. The
   increase in pH values within the pond was associated with an increase in
   dissolved oxygen (DO) and delta(15)N values and the partial
   disappearance of NO3-. This is explained by nitrogen assimilation and
   production of oxygen during photosynthesis by algae. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In groundwater resources it is frequently necessary to decide how much
   of the recharge to a groundwater unit is required to maintain the
   baseflows in the rivers of the unit. Groundwater recharge enters the
   aquifer in a very irregular way both in terms of seasonal variation and
   variation between years. As the water is transferred to the rivers some
   of this variation is smoothed out so that the baseflows exhibit less
   severe variation. In an idealised one-dimensional aquifer, the ability
   of the system to smooth this variation is determined by the parameter,
   aquifer response rate. An analytic solution is used to develop a type
   curve which allows calculation of the minimum baseflows in the rivers in
   the annual cycle from the aquifer response rate. The extension of this
   theory to unconfined aquifers and to real irregular variation in
   recharge is investigated using a simple finite difference numerical
   model. A method of calculation of the response rate for real aquifers is
   proposed and this is applied to three examples of groundwater units.
   These units contain rivers which are gauged so that the predicted
   minimum baseflows can be compared with the observed minimum baseflows.
   The method is intended to have application to real problems of water
   resources, particularly in catchments where river gauges do not exist.

Abstract = {{The chemistry of groundwater was studied in small subalpine watersheds
   under different forest cover types at Upper Penticton Creek (UPC). The
   purpose of the research was to derive a model to predict chemical
   concentrations of cations, bicarbonate, sulphate and silica in
   groundwater on the basis of fixed site parameters and seasonally
   variable parameters. It was shown that sulphate was largely of
   atmospheric origin, whereas the other chemical species were controlled
   primarily by mineral weathering. It was found that hydraulic
   conductivity was the most important site parameter that governed the
   weathering process, Hydrologic zone, describing whether the site was a
   hillslope site, streamside site or seepage site, and forest cover type
   were also important site parameters. Within sites, seasonal variability
   can be best described by head a measure of groundwater storage. The rang
   of within-site chemical variability was generally less than that
   attributable to between-site factors; notable exceptions are sulphate
   and potassium, both of which are controlled significantly by plant
   uptake. In the hillslope zone, forest cover was the primary factor
   controlling seasonal variability due to the relative homogeneity of
   hydraulic conductivity among the sites tested within that zone. A
   general site-specific model to predict groundwater chemistry as a
   function of hydraulic conductivity, forest cover, hydrologic zone and
   groundwater head is proposed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

   distributions have been observed in a small valley, Rather intricate,
   although distinctly persistent, patterns of local variations have been
   identified, strikingly dependent on local wind conditions. A dense
   network of both standard and directional ('inclined') raingages and
   vectopluviometers has been used. From the latter one may calculate the
   3-D direction, from which wind-driven rain is incident at respective
   measuring points. Results of this type have led to the reconstruction of
   some features of the locally perturbed wind field within the valley, A
   possible vortex became apparent in most cases, with its intensity
   varying in strict accordance with regional wind conditions and the angle
   of impact of winds relative to the valley axis. Results can serve to
   improve the design of rainfall monitoring networks, and more important,
   they may serve as a basis for adapting numerical models of local wind

Abstract = {{A new method to simulate flow and solute transport in 1-D heterogeneous
   media is presented. This method integrates the time domain random walk
   method (TDRW) and the finite fragment method (FFM). The TDRW, similar in
   concept to the classical random walk method, calculates the arrival time
   of a particle cloud at a given location and provides the solute
   breakthrough curve. The FFM, which can be seen as an enhancement of the
   finite difference scheme, allows a heterogenous media to be divided into
   homogeneous zones to which the TDRW can be applied. The main advantage
   of the resulting coupling is that the restrictions can be avoided on the
   space increments and the time steps which exist with the classical
   methods of finite differences and random walk. In a homogeneous zone of
   soil, the breakthrough curve can be calculated directly at a given
   distance with a reasonable number of particles. A 1-D heterogeneous
   domain to be simulated is then split into homogeneous zones in which the
   hydraulic heads and the velocities are calculated by the FFM and at the
   end of which the temporal solute distributions are calculated by the
   TDRW. A few hundred particles are generally sufficient to clearly define
   the breakthrough curve. Comparisons with analytical and numerical
   solutions and experimental data shows the reliability and advantages of
   this new method. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Land managers and stream restorationists often set goals or complete
   designs including specifications for pools that are unrealistic because
   of a lack of knowledge of the potential conditions of the stream. Using
   36 study sites on 17 rangeland streams in Nevada in the western United
   States, we determined relationships among pool and nonpool length,
   gradient, pool spacing, pool type and formative feature and stream type.
   Step pools primarily were formed by boulders while backwater pools were
   formed by coarse woody debris, This led to most pools being randomly
   located because structural pool-forming features are too large to move
   by the flows on these small streams. Montgomery and Buffington (1993)
   stream type associated with pool type and feature because of the direct
   linkage between the stream type definitions and pool features, Pool
   spacing varied only with Montgomery-Buffington stream type presumably
   because of its linkage with pool type and formative feature. Pool length
   varied with both Rosgen (1994) and Montgomery-Buffington stream type
   because of the relations between stream type and pool type and feature.
   Meander bend pools tended to be deeper because they form in erosive,
   fine substrate and because the spacing of forced pools may not be
   optimal which leads to sedimentation. Pool area did not vary with stream
   type but did with various formative features and pool and nonpool
   length, Variation of pool area with gradient and ln(gradient) was
   significant but explained much less variation than did other parameters.
   Meander bend dominated reaches had the highest pool area. The
   variability of results and the dependence of pool measures on pool type
   and formative feature indicates that strict adherence to published
   equations or expectations due to stream type should be avoided. Land
   managers should set goals for pool measures based on site specific
   conditions rather than perceived aquatic species needs or stream type.

Abstract = {{Hydrograph separation of runoff events in two nested alpine/subalpine
   basins in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia was carried out using
   electrical conductivity, specific concentration of silica and the stable
   isotopes oxygen-18 and deuterium as hydrological tracers. The methods
   predicted consistent high pre-storm water contribution for the subalpine
   site (60-90\%) but more variable contribution at the alpine basin outlet
   (25-90\%). The pre-storm water contribution is much larger than had
   previously been expected. Precipitation is believed to run off as
   overland Bow due to the steep slopes in combination with the hydrophobic
   soils until it can enter the subsurface environment. The rapid influx of
   stored water is possibly caused by pressure propagation in the macropore
   system which could be enhanced by the heavily fractured bedrock and
   permeable landslide debris acting as efficient hydrological conduits.
   The study suggests that alternative hydrological tracers such as
   electrical conductivity and silica concentration can be used under
   certain hydrological and lithological conditions. These alternative
   tracers should, however, be verified against more conventional tracers
   before use, as the behaviour depends on specific characteristics of each
   basin. At the upper basin outlet, both electrical conductivity (EC) and
   silica underestimated the pre-storm contribution. At the lower station,
   silica and EC showed a similar pattern to deuterium and oxygen-18
   tracers. The calculated pre-storm component using EC was, however,
   10-20\% lower than the calculated values from the other three tracers.
   The advantage of using these alternative tracers is that hydrograph
   separation results can, a priori, be anticipated. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Waters from the surface hydrologic network and the spring of a karstic
   aquifer in Switzerland were sampled to analyse their colloidal content.
   The measurements were done weekly with a single particle counter and
   were verified by other techniques. The particle size distribution (PSD)
   was modelled in two portions, below and above 5 mu m, using two types of
   equation: a power law (Pareto distribution) and an exponential law. The
   model results matched well with the entire PSD data set by varying the
   parameter values. The parameters obtained from fitting the measured PSD
   curves were then interpreted in relation to environmental factors.
   It appears that the two parts of the curves vary independently. The
   first part of the PSD curve, relating to the smallest particles, is
   dependent on the pH value of the spring or the temperature of the
   surface brook. In contrast, the second part of the curve depends mostly
   on the spring discharge volume. During high flow events, the major
   effect of the discharge on particle size occurs during the rising limb
   of the hydrograph, interpreted as clays deposited in the aquifer and
   resuspended due to high water velocity. The contrasted behaviour of the
   two parts of the PSD curves suggested that the break point in the curves
   represents the limit between colloidal and particulate behaviour.
   Knowing these dependencies, and the characteristics of the particulate
   matter, allowed the estimation of the role of the colloids in
   contaminant transport. Large fluxes of suspended matter, specific to
   karstic aquifers, demonstrate the critical role of colloids in
   contaminant transport, which is markedly different from what typically
   occurs in porous media. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The Great Bend Prairie freshwater alluvial aquifer in south-central
   Kansas overlies a bedrock brine aquifer of Permian age. The continuous
   extraction of freshwater mainly for irrigation in this area has
   accelerated the upward movement of the saltwater, resulting in the
   deterioration of water quality. Predicting saltwater upconing is
   critical for maintaining a long-term supply of water of good quality to
   the Groundwater Management District No. 5. This paper uses a numerical
   model to predict the effect of saltwater upconing on the salinity of
   pumped water. A sensitivity analysis was conducted for estimating the
   effects of uncertainties in model parameters on the numerical results.
   The most important factors affecting the salinity of discharged water
   are found to be the location and nature of clay layers in the aquifer,
   the pumping rate, the location of the well screen, and the hydraulic
   conductivities of the medium, The effect of uncertainties in aquifer
   porosity and dispersivity on salinity is appreciable but not
   substantial, whereas that of recharge from precipitation in the study
   area is relatively insignificant, In addition, a numerical model based
   on the field conditions observed at the Siefkes site was constructed and
   calibrated to reproduce and project the variation of measured water
   levels and discharged groundwater concentration. Finally, a number of
   practical management recommendations based on this study are presented.

Abstract = {{The depth-integrating sampler approach for measuring the
   velocity-weighted mean concentration of suspended sand in rivers was
   compared with the point-sampler approach whereby vertical profiles of
   velocity and sediment concentration are measured then integrated. The
   aim was to determine, for sand suspension in gravel bed rivers, the
   uncertainty induced when the depth-integrating sampler traverses the
   near-bed zone of high sand concentration too quickly to average-out the
   dominant fluctuations in sand concentration associated with turbulence.
   Depth-integrated and point samples, velocity profiles, and turbulence
   measurements were collected from three gravel bed rivers at various
   Flood stages. For two rivers, the sand and silt-clay fractions of the
   suspended load were determined, while at the third river four separate
   sand size fractions and the silt-clay fraction were analysed. The
   results showed that the agreement at-a-vertical between the two
   approaches improved exponentially as a function of the shear velocity to
   fall speed ratio, u{*}/w, ranging from up to +/-70\% for u{*}/w < 4 down
   to about +/-5\% for u{*}/w > 30. The exponential trend is consistent
   with diffusion models for suspended sediment vertical distributions
   which predict that the mixing increases as a function of the Rouse
   number w/(Bku{*}). Thus when the u{*}/w ratio is close to 1 the
   suspended sand load is concentrated near the bed and a depth-integrating
   sampler will only sample it for a small fraction of its total traverse
   time; conversely, with a large u{*}/w the sand will be mixed over the
   flow depth and it will be sampled for the same time by a
   depth-integrating sampler as by a point sampler. The agreement between
   the two approaches appeared to saturate at about +/-5\% at high values
   of u{*}/w in response to temporal variations in sediment concentration
   and flow velocity longer than the sampling time of either sampler, i.e.
   of the order of 1 min or more. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater flow in unconfined aquifers involves the determination of
   the free surface. Additionally, difficulties arise when dealing with
   seawater intrusion into unconfined aquifers, because this requires the
   location of both the phreatic surface and the interface separating
   freshwater from saltwater. A numerical procedure is developed for
   solving these problems in steady state with the finite element
   technique, assuming that groundwater flow is considered to occur only in
   the freshwater region of the saturated zone. The problem is solved with
   a fixed finite element mesh by iteratively adjusting the moving
   boundaries. This is achieved without explicitly changing the coefficient
   matrix of the finite element equations, which makes the method
   computationally fast. For the free surface problem, test examples
   demonstrate that the technique is accurate when compared to Polubarinova
   Kochina's analytical solution and laboratory measurements, and efficient
   when compared to the moving finite element mesh technique. For the
   saltwater intrusion interface, test problems, including saltwater
   intrusion into confined and unconfined aquifers, demonstrate that the
   technique is also accurate when compared to analytical solutions and
   laboratory measurements. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This study deals with the dispersive behaviour of a passive pollutant in
   an artesian aquifer, in which the three-dimensional flow field caused by
   a partially penetrating well is superimposed on a basic uniform
   groundwater flow.
   In order to describe the dispersion phenomenon, the convective aspect is
   analysed first. An original semi-analytical solution is proposed,
   involving a simplifying assumption entirely plausible from an
   engineering point of view, which enables us to obtain simple-to-use
   mathematical expressions of the potential and the corresponding flow
   field. The analyses developed to verify the correctness of the proposed
   solution are also presented, and diagrams are obtained which describe
   the principal dimensions of the convective catchment section of the well
   in relation to the geometric and hydraulic quantities governing the
   phenomenon.
   Subsequently, the dispersive aspect is described by means of the random
   walk method. This method provides us with a three-dimensional
   mathematical scheme, easily implemented on a computer, to analyse the
   particular dispersive phenomenon under examination.
   Two examples are also developed which illustrate the potential studies
   realisable with this scheme, in this case the description of the time
   evolution of a cloud or a pollutant plume and the influence of the
   position of the pollutant source in relation to the convective flow. (C)

Abstract = {{An alternative approach, based on fuzzy set theory, is presented to
   express imprecision of parameters in a non-probabilistic sense.
   Imprecision may originate from indirect measurements, estimation
   routines, subjective interpretation and expert judgement of available
   information. One dimensional, steady state water flow in the unsaturated
   zone of homogeneous soils, which is described by the Darcy-Buckingham
   equation, was chosen to evaluate and to incorporate fuzzy soil hydraulic
   properties and boundary conditions in the modeling procedure. It is here
   used to describe soil water pressures with depth, as well as to
   calculate maximum evapotranspiration rates under steady state
   conditions. Solving the fuzzy equation for steady state water flow
   results in minimizing/maximizing procedures, from where resulting
   membership functions of the dependent variable are calculated. A
   comparison to a more classical stochastic approach points out the main
   differences between fuzzy and stochastic concepts to account for
   uncertainties. Finally, a sensitivity analysis shows the strong impact
   of different shapes of membership functions of the input parameters on
   the resulting membership functions of maximum evapotranspiration rates
   and soil water pressures. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Stable isotopic techniques have been utilized to locate occurrences and
   trace movements of a variety of naturally and anthropogenically
   recharged waters in aquifers of Orange County, California. This basin is
   of particular interest not only because it provides the dominant water
   supply for the two million residents of this well-populated county, but
   also because it is representative of a common arid environment where
   natural recharge is dominated by distant, high-elevation precipitation
   transported by a major river, Such arid basins are particularly
   sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic disturbance of their recharge
   and their subsurface hydrology.
   In order to identify distinctive waters, oxygen and hydrogen stable
   isotope ratios from Orange County wells have been compared with a
   regional database including an array of surface water samples
   representative of watershed runoff, Four distinctive subsurface water
   types can be resolved. Waters of ``local{''} rainfall and imported,
   ``Colorado{''} River aqueduct origins are easily distinguished from
   dominant, ``native{''} Santa Ana river compositions by use of hydrogen
   and oxygen stable isotope analysis. Recent human interference with Santa
   Ana river flow and recharge is also marginally resolvable by isotopic
   techniques. Distinguishable isotopic signatures of ``recent{''} Santa
   Ana recharge appear to be due to evaporative loss, perhaps during
   storage in the Prado Reservoir or in percolation ponds, prior to
   recharge into Orange County aquifers, Characterization of traceable
   isotopic signatures of distinct natural and anthropogenic recharge
   components provides a major advance towards use of such techniques for
   developing a well constrained, three-dimensional hydrologic model for
   this complex basin. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Using principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis, and
   jackknife analysis, we investigated the spatial and temporal modes that
   dominate streamflow variability in the western US in response to El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Spatial variability was
   investigated with data only from ENSO years and with rotated PCA on 79
   streamflow stations in the western United States. Eight regions, or
   clusters, were thus pinpointed as areas where streamflow tends to
   co-vary similarly following ENSO events; traditional cluster analysis
   confirmed the identification of these regions. The ENSO response in
   streamflow was then further evaluated by forming an aggregate ENSO
   composite for each region.
   Temporal variability of western US streamflow in the PCA-identified
   regions was evaluated with a `T-mode' PCA that isolated the different
   responses in streamflow following ENSO events. The T-mode PCA breaks the
   13 ENSO events that occurred from 1932 to 1993 into five subsets. It is
   interesting to note that the events in the dominant mode, PC1(+),
   occurred before 1976, and next mode, PC2(+), included events prior to
   1976.
   Finally, we investigated the atmospheric circulation patterns over the
   North Pacific Ocean and much of North America that are associated with
   the various US streamflow responses. The circulation patterns vary
   according to the prescribed ENSO forcing. The results of this study
   contribute to a better understanding of the varied ENSO-streamflow
   relationship in the western US and the use of ENSO for long-range
   streamflow forecasting. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

   of spatially distributed data, to make it more physically sound and to
   improve the model performance. The new version, HBV-96, uses subbasin
   division with a typical resolution of 40 km(2), although any resolution
   can be used. In addition, each subbasin is divided into elevation bands,
   vegetation and snow classes. Automatic weighting of precipitation and
   temperature stations was introduced and a new automatic calibration
   scheme was developed. The modifications led to significant improvements
   in model performance. In seven test basins the average value of the
   efficiency criterion R-2 increased from 86 to 89\%, with improvements in
   both the calibration and verification periods. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The need to incorporate water resources into regional and global
   integrated assessment models for evaluating global change impacts has
   been identified as being important, but given the spatial and temporal
   variability of freshwater resources and limited data availability, the
   inclusion of water within these large scale models has proven to be
   difficult. A compromise between accurate representation of complex
   processes and simplistic parameterization is necessary for capturing
   regional and temporal variability and to minimize computational
   requirements. An analysis of Western Europe's and Africa's freshwater
   runoff, which spans a range of climate variability, was performed at
   varying levels of spatial aggregation and at both monthly and annual
   time steps. Model results showed that regional runoff characteristics
   were lost beyond a data aggregation of 1 degrees x 1 degrees resolution.
   A monthly soil moisture model proved to be adequate for assessing annual
   water availability, which is the scale often used in integrated
   assessment models. Simpler methods, such as an empirical annual model
   and a simple monthly model did not consistently replicate annual
   historic runoff. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Measured and simulated runoff data were used to evaluate the effects of
   surface conditions, particularly vegetative cover, on runoff from a 10
   ha pasture catchment in the semi-arid tropics of Queensland. The Answers
   model, modified to include a multilayered Green and Ampt representation
   of infiltration, was used to simulate runoff. Development,
   parametrisation and testing of Answers is described in Parts I and III
   of this series, Measured annual runoff at the catchment outlet decreased
   from 30\% of rainfall when the catchment was in a bare, grazed
   condition, to 5\% of rainfall when vegetative cover increased to 60\%
   after destocking and revegetation. A thorough comparison of the effect
   of cover on runoff from the measured record was difficult as rainfall
   was variable over the experimental period and surface conditions changed
   with revegetation. Answers was used to simulate runoff for the
   experimental duration using the measured rainfall record, but with
   consistent cover and surface conditions. Two cover conditions were
   simulated, bare (as in the early stages of the experiment) and covered
   (typical of cover conditions late in the experiment). Simulated high
   cover conditions increased by 10 mm the amount of rainfall required for
   runoff to occur, relative to bare conditions. Peak discharge was reduced
   with increased cover for runoff events with an average recurrence
   interval of up to 3 years. Several revegetation strategies were
   simulated. The most effective revegetation strategy, in terms of runoff
   reduction from all rainfall events, was to increase cover levels
   modestly across the whole catchment rather than to revegetate small
   areas intensively. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term water usage can be no more than that which is naturally
   available through the hydrologic cycle. To help in the determination of
   the hydrologically desirable water usage from surface and groundwater
   sources, a simple, idealized long-term analysis of water availability
   based solely on the natural hydrologic cycle is suggested. The concept
   of a hydrologic replacement time is introduced to determine the water
   availability from ground and surface water sources. Hydrologic
   replacement time is defined as the average time for water to complete a
   trip through a particular phase of the hydrologic cycle. The
   hydrologically desirable amount of water utilization from groundwater
   and surface water is proportional to the amount available from these
   sources. The available water is calculated on the basis of hydrologic
   replacement time, volume and any allowable water source depletion. The
   water availability problem is addressed at two spatial scales-global and
   continental. For each spatial scare two cases are considered: one in
   which no groundwater depletion is allowed and one in which a small
   amount of groundwater depletion is permissible. On the basis of the
   hydrologic characteristics of groundwater and surface water sources, it
   is desirable to utilize more surface water than groundwater for both
   spatial scales. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate estimation of potential evaporation (PE), to in turn
   calculate evapotranspiration, is an important step in many hydrologic
   models. The National Weather Service (NWS) has used PE to obtain daily
   estimates of mean evapotranspiration in continuous rainfall-runoff
   models for river forecasting. The daily PE estimates are derived mainly
   from meteorological data gathered on a regular basis throughout the
   country. Solar radiation is one of the required input variables. Because
   of its widespread availability, sky cover is now used almost exclusively
   by NWS to estimate solar radiation. Over a period of time, a bias has
   developed between the long-term mean PE (computed using a combination of
   historical observed pan evaporation data and meteorological data) and PE
   estimated operationally using real-time meteorological data. This
   difference is a result of the use of sky cover based solar radiation
   estimates. These biased solar radiation estimates translate into
   long-term means of PE which are significantly lower than values using
   corresponding direct measurements of solar radiation or estimates of
   solar radiation using percent sunshine. A standard for PE has been
   established and verified to which long-term means can be compared, PE
   estimates derived from sky cover can be corrected to the standard using
   a ratio of long-term means.
   Many meteorological variables which have been measured or observed
   manually in the past are being converted to automatic observations. With
   the advent of automated sensors, which do not duplicate the manual sky
   cover observations, another source of solar radiation is necessary to
   model PE for use in river forecasting. Satellite estimates of solar
   radiation are compared with ether means of measuring and estimating
   solar radiation, Available on a nationwide basis, satellite estimates
   produce values of solar radiation comparable to those obtained by direct
   measurement, Based on availability and accuracy, satellite estimates of
   solar radiation are recommended for use in the estimation of PE instead
   of estimates derived from sky cover or hours of sunshine (percent
   sunshine). This assumes that no direct observations of solar radiation
   are available. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the hydrology of the forest floor within a
   homogeneous Douglas fir forest. Time domain reflectometry measurements
   show that forest floor water contents have considerable spatial
   variabilities but similar temporal dynamics. Simple linear relations can
   be used to translate forest floor water content dynamics from one site
   in a forest to another. Forest floor evaporation rates were calculated
   using a previously developed forest floor evaporation model and a year
   of soil water and micrometeorological data. For a relatively wet site
   within the stand the calculated evaporation rate was 137 mm year(-1),
   for a more representative site 112 mm year(-1) and for a dry site 76 mm
   year(-1). These amounts range between 7 and 13\% of the total yearly
   forest evapotranspiration. Together with throughfall rates and
   transpiration rates, these forest floor evaporation rates served as
   boundary conditions to a soil water model with which we simulated forest
   floor and mineral soil water content dynamics. The simulations showed
   that throughfall and drainage dynamics determine the forest floor water
   content dynamics in wet conditions. In dry periods, forest floor
   evaporation and, to a lesser extent, root water uptake determine forest
   floor water content dynamics. The same simulations showed that 25\% of
   the forest floor evaporation is replenished by capillary rise from the
   mineral soil. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A rainfall-runoff model is applied to two large catchments of the
   Murray-Darling Basin, Australia: the Kiewa (552 km(2)) and Mitta-Mitta
   (1533 km(2)) Rivers. These catchments are located in the highest parts
   of the Australian alpine region and the effects of snow
   melt-accumulation processes feature prominently in the hydrological
   regime of these rivers, Accordingly, a model is developed to compute
   equivalent rainfall from raw precipitation records, taking into
   consideration snow melt-accumulation processes in the different parts of
   these catchments, This model uses temperature and precipitation data as
   input, determined on a daily basis over the whole region under
   consideration (2085 km(2)) using a spatial interpolation procedure with
   a resolution of 2.5 km x 2.5 km. The snow melt-accumulation model is
   based on a modified degree-day method and provides the equivalent amount
   of melted-accumulated water for each grid cell of the catchments
   considered. The method allows modelling of the melt-accumulation
   processes directly without requiring information about observed snow
   cover distribution in the area. Daily streamflow for the Kiewa and
   Mitta-Mitta Rivers is then modelled using as input the equivalent
   rainfall estimated by the snow melt-accumulation module and the mean
   daily temperature in each grid cell integrated over the whole
   catchments. Model calibration on 2 year periods is performed, and
   subsequent simulation of streamflow over an 18 year period of
   observation with these calibrated models yields encouraging results for
   those wishing to use such a simplified approach. Given scenarios of
   precipitation and temperature change, the model may be used to estimate
   future climate impacts under the assumption that the hydrological effect
   of vegetation cover in the area remains similar. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper examines the relationship between the annual discharges of
   the Amazon, Congo, Paran ii, and Nile rivers and the sea surface
   temperature (SST) anomalies of the eastern and central equatorial
   Pacific Ocean, an index of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Since
   river systems are comprehensive integrators of rainfall over large
   areas, accurate characterization of the flow regimes in major rivers
   will increase our understanding of large-scale global atmospheric
   dynamics. Results of this study reveal that the annual discharges of two
   large equatorial tropical rivers, the Amazon and. the Cungo, are weakly
   and negatively correlated with the equatorial Pacific SST anomalies with
   10\% of the variance in annual discharge explained by ENSO. Two smaller
   subtropical rivers, the Nile and the Parana, show a correlation chat is
   stronger by about a factor of 2. The Nile discharge is negatively
   correlated with the SST anomaly, whereas the Parana river discharge
   shows a positive relation. The tendency for reduced rainfall/discharge
   over large tropical convection zones in the ENSO warm phase is
   attributed to global scale subsidence associated with major upwelling in
   the eastern Pacific Ocean. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Scale properties of daily areal rainfall in south-eastern Norway are
   investigated, and the events are classified into small- and large-scale
   events by statistical pattern recognition. The coefficient of variation
   and the standard deviation, computed from all precipitation gauges for
   one event, are considered to he mutually independent and are assigned
   gamma densities. The two statistical parameters form a feature vector
   which is used as the discriminatory Variable in the classification
   algorithm, Empirical and theoretical semivariograms were fitted to the
   classified sets of events, and the parameters of the semivariogram
   (nugget, sill and range) were investigated far each set. Different
   values for all parameters were found, and the differences in range,
   describing the scale of the phenomena, were further investigated by the
   use of cross validation with the MSIE (mean squared interpolation error)
   criterion, Optimal range of daily small-scale precipitation was found to
   be 16 km (19 km without nugget effect), and 33 km (70 km without nugget
   effect) for daily large-scale precipitation, These optimal values for
   range, however, proved to be of small consequence for the estimated
   areal precipitation using kriging interpolation. Areal precipitation was
   computed for catchments of size 50 km(2) and 1200 km(2), and
   insignificant differences in the computed areal precipitation were found
   when applying the class-specific semivariograms instead of the mean
   semivariogram calculated from all events regardless of class. However,
   when areal reduction factors (ARFs) were derived from the analytical
   expressions of the class-specific semivariograms, considerable
   differences were found for the ARF curves of the two precipitation
   types. The difference became more marked for precipitation events of low
   probability of occurrence. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of a theoretical description of the urban water cycle by
   means of physically based models has been presented, A high-resolution
   three-dimensional finite-difference storm model was used to simulate
   convective rainfall over an urban catchment near Paris, A hydrological
   model described the surface processes as well as the discharge processes
   in the sewer system, The comparison of model results with the
   observational data indicated that the rainfall simulation (space-time
   distribution and quantity) was the most critical part of the
   simulations. Subsequently, the coupled system simulated well the overall
   discharge distribution and the dynamic response of the discharge at the
   principal outlets of the sewer system, Results indicated that a purely
   mechanical description of the water cycle is feasible and that this
   could be a useful tool for investigation of the urban environment in the

Abstract = {{In order to understand runoff generation processes on a forested
   hillslope involving large heterogeneities, this study monitored runoff
   from a steep hillslope with a thin soil layer as well as matric
   potential within it and analyzed their responses to storm rainfall. A
   comparison of storm runoff responses from the study slope with those
   from two adjacent catchments, one of which includes it, showed that
   physical properties of the slope reflected the runoff characteristics:
   although no responses occurred in very dry conditions because of the
   absence of wet zones near the stream, the area contributing: to storm
   runoff more rapidly extended to the whole slope due to its topographic
   properties. They also caused its steep hydrographs produced in the
   wettest condition where almost all the rainfall contributed to storm
   runoff. In this wettest condition, tensiometric responses near bedrock
   showed the vertical quick propagation of the rainfall pulse, and a good
   agreement of storm hydrograph simulated through a kinematic wave runoff
   model suggested that runoff from the slope was produced by a lateral
   flow on the bedrock receiving the quick propagation. In a transition
   process from dry to the wettest conditions, the development of the
   lateral Bow producing smaller responses at the downslope end was
   estimated from decreasing of matric potential near bedrock from high
   negative to low values with increasing cumulative rainfall. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Groundwater evaporation and subsequent precipitation of soluble sails at
   Owens Lake in eastern California have created one of the single largest
   sources of airborne dust in the USA, yet the evaporation add salt Aux
   have not been fully quantified. In this study, we compare eddy
   correlation, microlysimeters and solute profiling methods to determine
   their validity and sensitivity in playa environments. These techniques
   are often used to estimate evaporative losses, yet have not been
   critically compared al one field site to judge their relative
   effectiveness and accuracy, Results suggest that eddy correlation
   methods are the most widely applicable for the variety of conditions
   found oa large playa lakes. Chloride profiling is shown to he highly
   sensitive to thermal and density-driven fluxes in the near surface and,
   as a result, appears to underestimate yearly groundwater evaporation.
   Yearly mean groundwater evaporation from the playa surface estimated
   from the three study areas was found to range from 88 to 104 mm
   year(-1), whereas mean evaporation from the brine-covered areas was 872
   mm year(-1). Uncertainties on these mean rates were estimated to be
   +/-25\%, based on comparisons between eddy correlation and lysimeter
   estimates, On a yearly basis, evaporation accounts for approximately 47
   x 10(6) m(3) of water loss from the playa surface and open-water areas
   of the lake, Over the playa area as much as 7.5 x 10(8) kg (7.5 x 10(5)
   t) of salt are annually concentrated by evaporation at or near the playa
   surface, much of which appears to be lost during dust storms in the
   area. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The heat-pulse technique was used to estimate year-long water uptake in
   a discharge zone plantation of 9-year-old clonal Eucalyptus
   camaldulensis Dehnh, near Wubin, Western Australia, Water uptake matched
   rainfall closely during wetter months but exceeded rainfall as the dry
   season progressed. Average annual water uptake (1148 mm) exceeded
   rainfall (432 mm) by about 2.7 fold and approached 56\% of pan
   evaporation for the area. The data suggest that at least 37\% (i.e.
   (1/2.7) x 100) of the lower catchment discharge zone should be planted
   to prevent the rise of groundwater.
   Water uptake varied with soil environment, season and genotype. Upslope
   trees used more water than did downslope trees. Water uptake was higher
   in E. camaldulensis clone M80 than in clone M66 until late spring, The
   difference reversed as summer progressed, Both clones, however, have the
   potential to dry out the landscape when potential evapotranspiration
   exceeds rainfall. This variation in water uptake within the species
   indicates the potential for manipulating plantation uptake by matching
   tree characteristics to site characteristics,
   Controlled experiments on the heat-pulse technique indicated accuracy
   errors of approximately 10\%. This, combined with the ability to obtain
   long-term, continuous data and the superior logistics of use of the
   heat-pulse technique, suggests that results obtained by it would be much
   more reliable than those achieved by the ventilated chamber technique.

Abstract = {{A mathematical model to simulate stream/aquifer interactions in an
   unconfined aquifer subjected to time varying river stage was developed
   from the linearized Boussinesq equation using the principle of
   superposition and the concept of semigroups. The mathematical model
   requires an estimate of three parameters to simulate ground-water
   elevations; transmissivity, specific yield, and recharge. The solution
   has physical significance and includes terms for the steady-state water
   level, the steady-state water level as influenced by a change in river
   stage, a transient redistribution of water levels in the aquifer from
   the previous day, and a transient change in water level caused by a
   change in river stage. The mathematical model was tested using observed
   water table elevations at three locations across a 2-km-wide alluvial
   valley aquifer. The average absolute deviation between observed and
   simulated daily water levels was 0.09 m. The difference in river stage
   over the test year was 4.9 m. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{A non-linear perturbation model for river flow forecasting is developed,
   based on consideration of catchment wetness using an antecedent
   precipitation index (API). Catchment seasonality, of the form accounted
   for in the linear perturbation model (the LPM), and non-linear behaviour
   both in the runoff generation mechanism and in the flow routing
   processes are represented by a constrained nan-linear model, the
   NLPM-API. A total of ten catchments, across a range of climatic
   conditions and catchment area magnitudes, located in China and in other
   countries, were selected for testing daily rainfall-runoff forecasting
   with this model. It was found that the NLPM-API model was significantly
   more efficient than the original linear perturbation model (the LPM).
   However, restric tion of explicit nan-linearity to the runoff generation
   process, in the simpler LPM-API form of the model, did not produce a
   significantly lower value of the efficiency in flood forecasting, in
   terms of the model efficiency index R-2. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model has been produced to examine the impact of sewage
   sludge and fertilizer application to arable land and the effect of
   different crop regimes on the amount of nitrate leached to chalk
   groundwater. Previous work on nitrate leaching has concentrated on
   either a soil science or a hydrogeological approach with little overlap
   between the two, This study considered both fields to obtain an overall
   picture of the nitrate leaching process, IMPACT is a layered
   deterministic N-leaching model which predicts the nitrogen loads
   entering groundwater daily from arable land, and can be used as a
   management tool in development of sludge application and agricultural
   policy. The model relates nitrogen species movement resulting from the
   application of sewage sludge and fertilizer to differing
   vegetation-soil-hydrogeological conditions. Field data collected at
   three sites on the unconfined chalk aquifer of East Anglia, England over
   a two and a half year period was used to produce an initial conceptual
   model and to constrain the mathematical model during development. IMPACT
   simulates nitrogen and transport processes in the soil and unsaturated
   zone of the chalk. The nitrogen processes include: mineralisation of
   soil organic-N and sewage sludge organic-N, nitrification; crop uptake;
   volatilization; denitrification; and N inputs from fertilizers and
   precipitation. A mixing cell method is used to model solute transport in
   both the soil and chalk. Matrix flow and combined fissure-matrix Bow are
   considered for the chalk. The model enables examination of the
   relationship between the arable/hydrogeological systems and the
   environmental implications of sludge application and of different arable
   regimes. Results are of use in developing strategies for arable farming
   and sludge application in areas sensitive to nitrate leaching. This Part
   1 paper describes the model development approach. Results of associated
   modelling scenarios are presented separately in the associated Part 2
   paper. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A layered deterministic N-leaching model, IMPACT, has been calibrated
   using data from two study sites on the unconfined Calk aquifer of East
   Anglia, UK. The model predicts nitrogen species movement resulting from
   the application of sewage sludges and fertilizers to arable land for
   different vegetation-soil-hydrogeological conditions. One site received
   sludge in the form of digested sewage cake (DSC) for the first time
   during the study period, whilst the other site had over 15 years history
   of liquid undigested sludge (LUS) applications at 3 year intervals. Site
   data included: 3-monthly concentration profiles at 0.3 m intervals to
   depths of up to 6 m for N-species and chloride: unsaturated potential
   measurements; water level and saturated groundwater solute
   concentrations. fertilizer and sludge input; daily recharge, and
   soil/chalk type and moisture content. The observed average movement rate
   for nitrate peaks in the Lower Chalk, measured at one site, was 0.2 m
   year(-1). Leachate peaks were not observed annually but approximately
   every third year, being associated with large sludge applications and
   ploughing of grass crops. Significant correlations between observed and
   modelled nitrate profiles in soil and chalk were obtained which
   demonstrated the importance of nitrate production from organic sources
   such as ploughed in grass crops and sludge applications. The
   relationship between crop demand, application times of fertilizers and
   sludge, nitrate availability and recharge was shown strongly to control
   the shape of nitrate profiles in the soil and chalk and the quantity of
   nitrate leached to chalk. The change in hydrogeological conditions at
   the soil-chalk contact and associated potential for denitrification was
   also shown to exert a significant control on the shape of the nitrate
   profile. Following calibration, different arable crop and sludge
   application regimes were examined for a 6 year period and ranked
   according to their nitrate leaching risk, Of the modelled cereal farming
   scenarios, the crop/sludge regime giving the least nitrate leaching was
   a late autumn surface spread application of DSC followed by winter
   cereals, while highest nitrate leaching was generated by an autumn
   injection of LUS followed by spring cereals. Field and modelled results
   may be used in the development of sludge disposal policies to arable
   land particularly with regard to sludge types, application times, and
   following crop types and fertilizer requirements. Overall, observed and
   model data demonstrate the importance of examining nitrate leaching as a
   continuum from the soil through the chalk to the water table. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Oscillation and numerical dispersion limit the reliability of numerical
   solutions of the convection-dispersion equation when finite difference
   methods are used. To eliminate oscillation and reduce the numerical

   accuracy of the proposed numerical method is tested against two

   of the numerical results obtained with different numerical schemes and
   those obtained by the analytical solutions demonstrates the possibility

Title = {{The errors in surface runoff prediction by neglecting the relationship
   between infiltration rate and overland flow depth}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{200}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{243-259}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Many simplifications are used in modeling surface runoff over a uniform
   slope. A very common simplification is to determine the infiltration
   rate independent of the overland Bow depth and to combine it afterward
   with the kinematic-wave equation to determine the overland flow depth.
   Another simplification is to replace the spatially variable infiltration
   rates along the slope i(x, t) due to the water depth variations h(x, t)
   with an infiltration rate that is determined at a certain location along
   the slope. The aim of this study is to evaluate the errors induced by
   these simplifications on predicted infiltration rates, overland flow
   depths, and total runoff volume, The error analysis is accomplished by
   comparing a simplified model with a model where the interaction between
   the overland Bow depth and infiltration rate is counted. In this model,
   the infiltration rate is assumed to vary along the slope with the
   overland flow depth, even for homogeneous soil profiles. The
   kinematic-wave equation with interactive infiltration rate, calculated
   along the slope by Richard's equation, are then solved by a finite
   difference scheme for a 100-m-long uniform slope, In the first error
   analysis, we study the effect of combining an `exact' and `approximate'
   one-dimensional infiltration rate with the kinematic-wave equation for
   three different soil surface roughness coefficients, The terms `exact'
   and `approximate' stand for the solution of Richard's equation with and
   without using the overland flow depth in the boundary condition,
   respectively. The simulations showed that higher infiltration rates and
   lower overland flow depths are obtained during the rising stage of the
   hydrograph when overland flow depth is used in the upper boundary
   condition of the one-dimensional Richard's equation. During the
   recession period, the simplified model predicts lower infiltration rates
   and higher overland flow depths, The absolute relative errors between
   the `exact' and `approximate' solutions are positively correlated to the
   overland flow depths which increase with the soil surface roughness
   coefficient. For this error analysis, the relative errors in surface
   runoff volume per unit slope width throughout the storm are much smaller
   than the relative errors in momentary overland flow depths and
   discharges due to the alternate signs of the deviations along the rising
   and falling stages. In the second error analysis, when the spatially
   variable infiltration rate along the slope i(x, t) is replated in the
   kinematic-wave equation by i(t), calculated al the slope outlet, the
   overland flow depth is underestimated during the rising stage of the
   hydrograph and overestimated during the falling stage. The deviations
   during the rising stage are much smaller than the deviations during the
   falling stage, but they are of a longer duration. This occurs because
   the solution with i(x, t) recognizes that part of the slope becomes dry
   after rainfall stops, while overland flow still exists with i(t)
   determined at the slope outlet. As obtained for the first error
   analysis, the relative errors in surface runoff volume per unit slope
   width are also much smaller than the relative errors in momentary
   overland flow depths and discharges. The relation between the errors in
   overland now depth and discharge to different mathematical
   simplifications enables to evaluate whether certain simplifications are
   justified or more computational efforts should be used. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Results from a programme of throughfall measurements in a lowland
   tropical rainforest in Brunei, northwest Borneo, indicate that
   interception losses amount to 18\% of the gross incident rainfall. The
   high annual rainfall experienced bq the study area results in annual
   interception losses of around 800 mm, which may result in total annual
   evapotranspiration losses significantly higher than in other rainforest
   locations. An improved version of Cash's analyticaI interception model
   is tested on the available data using assumed values for the
   ``forest{''} parameters, and is found to predict interception losses
   extremely well, The model predictions are based on an estimated
   evaporation rate during rainfall of 0.71 mm h(-1). This is significantly
   higher than has been reported in other tropical studies. It is concluded
   that these results are distinctive when compared with previous results
   from rainforests, and that further, detailed work is required to
   establish whether the enhanced evaporation rate is due to advective
   effects associated with the maritime setting of the study area. (C) 1997

   distributions and estimators for extreme values based on a fixed number
   r > = 1 of the largest annual events are presented. The method of
   estimation was numerical maximum likelihood. In this paper, we consider
   the robust estimation of parameters in such families of distributions.
   The estimation technique, which is based on optimal B-robust estimates,
   will assign weights to each observation and give estimates of the
   parameters based on the data which are well modeled by the distribution.
   Thus, observations which are not consistent with the proposed
   distribution can be identified and the validity of the model can be
   assessed. The method is illustrated on Venice sea level data. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The identifiability of model parameters of a steady state water quality
   model of the Biebrza River and the resulting variation in model results
   was examined by applying the Monte Carlo method which combines
   calibration, identifiability analysis, uncertainty analysis, and
   sensitivity analysis. The water quality model simulates the steady state
   concentration profiles of chloride, phosphate, ammonium, and nitrate as
   a function of distance along a river. The water quality model with the
   best combination of parameter values simulates the observed
   concentrations very well. However, the range of possible modelled
   concentrations obtained for other more or less equally eligible
   combinations of parameter values is rather wide. This range in model
   outcomes reflects possible errors in the model parameters. Discrepancies
   between the range in model outcomes and the validation data set are only
   caused by errors in model structure, or (measurement) errors in boundary
   conditions or input variables. In this sense the validation procedure is
   a test of model capability, where the effects of calibration errors are
   filtered out. It is concluded that, despite some slight deviations
   between model outcome and observations, the model is successful in
   simulating the spatial pattern of nutrient concentrations in the Biebrza
   River. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The colloidal borescope consists of a set of lenses and miniature video
   cameras capable of observing natural particles in monitoring wells.
   Based on field observations of these particles, it appears possible to
   measure in situ groundwater velocity in a well bore. Field observations
   have shown that directional measurements using the colloidal borescope
   are generally in good agreement with expected flow directions. However,
   the magnitude of Bow velocity is higher compared with values based on
   conventional test methods. High relative Bow velocities, even after
   correction factors have been applied to compensate for well bore
   effects, are believed to be due to preferential Bow zones in the
   surrounding aquifer. Low flow zones exhibit swirling multidirectional
   flow that does not allow for a linear velocity measurement.
   Consequently, groundwater Bow velocities measured by the colloidal
   borescope in heterogeneous aquifers will be biased toward the maximum
   velocity values present in the aquifer. A series of laboratory
   experiments was conducted to assess the reliability of the instrument.
   Based on this work, a seepage velocity correction factor (<(alpha)over
   bar>) of 1-4 was found for quantifying groundwater seepage velocity in
   the adjacent aquifer from observations in a well bore. Laboratory
   measurements also indicate that preferential flow in the surrounding
   aquifer dominates flow in the well. Results of this work suggest the
   possibility of quantifying higher-flow velocities associated with
   preferential flow zones in the subsurface. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This paper concerns heat transfer and water infiltration into a
   homogeneous, unsaturated, frozen soil. A numerical analysis of the
   processes, which is based on the local volume averaging formulation of
   transport phenomena in porous media, is described. Simultaneous heat and
   mass transfers with phase changes are considered. The results of the
   simulations provide an insight into the mechanics of the infiltration
   process. They suggest that infiltration involves primarily two flow
   regimes, a transient regime and a quasi-steady-state regime. Once the
   quasi-steady-state regime is reached, the energy needed to increase soil
   temperature at depth is supplied by latent heat released from freezing
   of water in the upper layers of soil. The effects of surface saturation,
   initial soil saturation and initial soil temperature on infiltration are
   examined. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Maps of 25 groundwater quality variables were obtained by estimating 4
   km x 4 km block median concentrations, Estimates were presented as
   approximate 95\% confidence intervals related to four concentration
   levels mostly obtained from critical levels for human consumption. These
   maps were based on measurements from 425 monitoring sites of national
   and provincial groundwater quality monitoring networks. The estimation
   procedure was based on a stratification by soil type and land use.
   Within each soil-land use category, measurements were interpolated.
   Spatial dependence between measurements and regional differences in mean
   level were taken into account, Stratification turned out ro be
   essential: no or partial stratification (using either soil type or land
   use) results in essentially different maps. The effect of monitoring
   network density was studied by leaving out the 173 monitoring sites of
   the provincial monitoring networks. Important changes in resulting maps
   were assigned to loss of information on short-distance variation, as
   well as loss of location-specific information, For 12 variables, maps of
   changes in groundwater quality were made by spatial interpolation of
   short-term predictions calculated for each well screen from time series
   of yearly measurements over 5-7 years, using a simple regression model
   for variation over rime and taking location-specific time-prediction
   uncertainties into account.
   From a policy point of view, the resulting maps can be used either for
   quantifying diffuse groundwater contamination and location-specific
   background concentrations (in order to assist local contamination
   assessment) or for input and validation of policy supporting regional or
   national groundwater quality models. The maps can be considered as a
   translation of point information obtained from the monitoring networks
   into information on spatial units, the size of which is used in regional
   groundwater models, The maps enable location-specific network
   optimization, In general, the maps give little reason for reducing the
   monitoring network density (wide confidence intervals). (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Study of the movement of chemical compounds naturally present in the
   water, or which result from pollution, are examined according to the
   reservoir structure in karstic aquifers. Structure is represented by a
   simple geometrical model; slow Row takes place in blocks with a network
   of low-permeability cracks. The blocks are separated by highly permeable
   karstic conduits that allow rapid flow, and these form the aquifer
   drainage system. The karat studied covers 110 km(2). It is fed by an
   interrupted stream draining a 35 km(2) non-karstic basin, contaminated
   at the entry to the karst by effluents from a sewage treatment station.
   The underground water reappears as a resurgence with an annual average
   flow of approximately 1 m(3) s(-1), after an apparent underground course
   of 8 km in the karst. Several local sources of pollution (effluent from
   septic tanks) contaminate the underground water during its course.
   Sixteen measurement operations were performed at 12 water points,
   between the interrupted stream and the spring. Some sampling points were
   at drains, and others were in the low-permeability fissured blocks.
   Comparison at each point of the concentrations of 14 chemical compounds
   gave the following results: when pollutant discharge occurs in a
   permeable zone, movement is rapid in the drainage network formed by the
   karstic conduits, and does not reach the less permeable fissured blocks
   which are thus protected; however, if discharge is in a low-permeability
   zone, the flow does not allow rapid movement of the polluted water, and
   this increases the pollutant concentration at the discharge, This simple
   pattern can be upset by a reversal of the apparent piezometric gradient
   between a block and a conduit during Floods or pumping; this may reverse
   flow directions and hence modify the movement of contaminants. The study
   made it possible to site five boreholes whose positions in the karstic
   structure were unknown, showing the interest of such an approach for the
   forecasting of the impact of potential pollution. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In the semi-arid Niamey area (Niger), more than 10\% of the deep wells
   exploiting the fracture network of the Precambrian aquifer are
   contaminated by nitrates, with concentrations as high as 10 meq l(-1).
   In order to identify the source(s) of this pollution, nitrate and N-15
   contents in the polluted wells were monitored over a 20-month period.
   Potential sources of nitrate contamination were also analyzed for their
   N-15 content. The isotopic compositions of nitrate in polluted waters
   were > + 12 parts per thousand and in ran cases exceeded +17 parts per
   thousand. Latrines (similar to + 15 parts per thousand) may be the major
   nitrate source for wells showing delta(15)N values above + 15 parts per
   thousand. Below this value, waters may be polluted by a combination of
   nitrates from both latrine and soil sources (similar to + 10 parts per
   thousand). In some cases, the soil may account for up to 85\% of the
   groundwater nitrate load. This mode of groundwater pollution is thought
   to be a consequence of deforestation. Despite their reputation as
   polluting agents, fertilizers (+ 0.5 < delta(15)N < + 3.6 parts per
   thousand) which are used in rice paddies close to the contaminated
   areas, do not appear to be a significant source of nitrate
   contamination. Denitrification is probably not a significant process in
   the study area. Results suggest that nitrate contamination of the
   aquifer is a consequence of unregulated urbanization (home-made
   latrines) and deforestation. While latrines are limited to the urban
   zones, intensive cutting of the forest to meet the city dwellers' wood
   demand occurs in an ever increasing area around the capital, threatening
   the local water supply. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Evaporation from a cutover raised bog in The Netherlands was modelled
   using a detailed, physically based evaporation model for heterogeneous
   vegetation and unsaturated soil water how `'SWAPS''. The model enables a
   quantification of the role of heterogeneity on evaporation.
   Micro-meteorological measurements above a vegetation of Molinia caerulea
   (purple moor grass) in the cutover raised bog `'Engbertsdijksvenen'' are
   used for calibration and validation of the model. In the present study,
   it is investigated how small scale heterogeneity affects the prediction
   of evaporation. Therefore, two hypothetical variants, which represent
   two possible types of small scale heterogeneity in peatlands, are
   evaluated: (1) peatland in which drainage has resulted in a vegetation
   cover of 50\% purple moor grass and 50\% birch, (2) peatland in which
   after rewetting the vegetation consists of 50\% purple moor grass and
   50\% Sphagnum mosses. The results show that characteristics of the
   evaporation from purple moor grass in the two variants are dissimilar.
   The evaporation from purple moor grass, forming the lower components of
   a vegetation stand (variant I), can be accurately predicted via
   radiation based models. In case purple moor grass is the exposed part of
   the vegetation (variant 2), such models are not likely to predict the
   evaporation from purple moor grass correctly. An exposed,
   aerodynamically rough vegetation requires a model that accounts for the
   vapour pressure deficit as well. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the application of a neural network technique in
   the context of rainfall-runoff modelling. The chosen form of neural
   network is tested using different types of input information, namely,
   rainfall, historical seasonal and nearest neighbour information. Using
   the data of six catchments, the technique is applied for four different
   input scenarios in each of which some or all of these input types are
   used. The performance of the technique is compared with those of models
   that utilize similar input information, namely, the simple linear
   model(SLM), the seasonally based linear perturbation model (LPM) and the
   nearest neighbour linear perturbation model (NNLPM). The results suggest
   that the neural network shows considerable promise in the context of
   rainfall-runoff modelling but, like all such models, has variable
   results. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic functions of soils may differ depending on the different
   measuring methods used. The performance of three different methods for
   measuring soil-hydraulic properties of a heterogeneous field were
   evaluated. The experiments were conducted using three different sizes of
   undisturbed soil cores collected systematically along a 31 m long
   transect of a well drained sandy loam soil having three soil horizons
   (Ap, 0-0.25 m; C1, 0.25-0.55 m; C2, 0.55-1.00 m). The laboratory studies
   involved: (1) detailed unsteady drainage-flux experiments performed on
   fifteen columns of 1 m length and 0.3 m diameter; (2) combined crust
   test and hot air methods applied to thirty columns of 0.2 m length and
   0.2 m diameter and to a subset of sixty cylinders of 0.1 m length and
   0.045 m diameter, respectively, taken from the Ap horizon; and (3)
   desorption experiments carried out on a total of one hundred eighty
   cores of 0.051 m length and 0.05 m diameter collected evenly from the
   three horizons, Mean soil hydraulic properties were inferred from
   experimental data characterizing either selected depths or the soil
   profile as a whole. The results revealed considerable differences among
   estimated mean soil properties as obtained with different measuring
   techniques. Although the application of scaling theory substantially
   reduced variation in the measured pressure heads (h) and conductivities
   (K), the results revealed that scaling parameters determined from soil
   pressure head were not identical to scaling factors determined from
   hydraulic conductivity. The results also show that K scaling factors in
   general were much more variable than h scaling factors, and that the
   observed variability in scaling factors also depend upon the measurement
   technique used. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{La Selva Biological Station occupies an area of lowland tropical
   rainforest in central Costa Rica. Sodium and chloride data were used to
   quantify the mixing proportions of local runoff and geothermal
   groundwater at several sites throughout the stream channel system in
   late April, at the end of the dry season. The fraction of streamflow
   accounted for by geothermal groundwater varied spatially between 0 and
   0.85, indicating a significant contribution to streamflow and to stream
   solute loads from geothermal groundwater at some sites. In general,
   higher inputs of geothermal groundwater were found at lower elevations.
   Over half the flow from one basin (the Salto) was due to geothermal
   groundwater, suggesting a minimum annual runoff of about 0.7 m of
   geothermal groundwater from this basin, A plot of Na/Cl vs. fraction of
   geothermal groundwater revealed watershed-scale chemical differences
   between the two major drainage systems (the Sura and the Salto),
   differences that were not apparent from a traditional two-solute plot of
   Cl vs. Na concentration. A small (21 mm) storm produced relatively
   little change in mixing proportions, as most throughfall was apparently
   retained in the relatively dry soils. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring (in 5 min steps) of precipitation, throughfall, stemflow and
   bulk canopy wetness, and also weather conditions and soil moisture, was
   carried out from July 1993 to December 1995, in a Pinus sylvestris
   forest patch located in a Mediterranean mountainous former agricultural
   basin subject to spontaneous change from pasture to forest. Throughfall
   collectors were designed to obtain hydrologically representative data
   and they consist of nine troughs with a total catchment area of 9 m(2).
   The bulk interception rate measured after 30 months of monitoring was
   about 24\%. Relative interception was irregular and decreased with the
   magnitude of the event; it was at least 15\% for events of more than 20
   mm.
   Multivariate analysis of the events demonstrates that their
   characteristics can be simplified in two main factors which respectively
   represent the duration of the event and its magnitude. The magnitude of
   the event biases the characterization because of the non-linearity of
   the rainfall-interception relationship. Long events do not produce
   higher interception rates than shorter ones because of the occurrence of
   low vapour pressure deficits during the former. In atmospheric dry
   conditions the rainfall intensity provides the main control on
   interception rates. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

   The results seems to indicate that the Gash analytical model is

Abstract = {{The reductions in streamflow following the afforestation of grassland
   with Eucalyptus grandis and Pinus patula in the Mokobulaan research
   catchments on the Mpumalanga escarpment, and the subsequent response in
   streamflow to clearfelling of the eucalypts are presented. Afforestation
   with eucalypts of an entire catchment with a virgin annual runoff of 236
   mm, caused a statistically significant decrease in streamflow in the
   third year after planting and the stream dried up completely in the
   ninth year after planting. The eucalypts were clearfelled when 16 years
   old but full perennial streamflow did not return until five years later.
   Afforestation with pines of an entire catchment with a virgin annual
   runoff of 217 mm, produced a significant decrease in streamflow in the
   fourth year after planting and caused the stream to dry up completely in
   the twelfth year after planting.
   The drying up of the streams was not altogether surprising as the annual
   runoff was lower than the expected reductions owing to complete
   afforestation. The delayed return of streamflow in the clearfelled
   catchment is surprising though, and is attributed to the desiccation of
   deep, soil-water stores by the eucalypts. These stores had to be
   replenished before the streams could return to normal behaviour. (C)

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional groundwater transport equation with two uncertain
   parameters, groundwater velocity and longitudinal dispersivity, is
   investigated in this paper. The analytical uncertainty of the predicted
   contaminant concentration is derived by the first-order mean-centered
   uncertainty analysis. The risk of the contaminant transport is defined
   as the probability that the concentration exceeds a maximum acceptable
   upper limit. Five probability density functions including the normal,
   lognormal, gamma, Gumbel, and Weibull distributions are chosen as the
   models for predicting the concentration distribution. The risk for each
   distribution is derived analytically based on the conditional
   probability. The mean risk and confidence interval are then computed by
   Monte Carlo simulation where the groundwater velocity and longitudinal
   dispersivity are assumed to be lognormally and normally distributed,
   respectively. Results from the conditional expectation of an assumed
   damage function show that the unconditional expectation generally
   underestimates the damage for low risk events. It is found from the
   sensitivity analysis that the mean longitudinal dispersivity is the most
   sensitive parameter and the variance of longitudinal dispersivity is the
   least sensitive one among those distribution models except the gamma and
   Weibull distributions. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Title = {{Influence of components of the advection-aridity approach on
   evapotranspiration estimation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{199}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{3-12}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Several methods have been proposed to estimate areal evapotranspiration
   from common meteorological data. The advection-aridity approach is one
   such method which requires no site-calibrated parameters, and uses
   measurements at a single elevation which are commonly available from a
   meteorological station. The method is based on a complementary
   relationship between actual and potential evapotranspiration which
   postulates that a decrease in actual evapotranspiration will result in a
   complementary or symmetrical increase in potential evapotranspiration
   for a given energy input. In this paper, the advection-aridity equations
   were rewritten to isolate terms which account for available energy,
   advection or drying power of the air, and sensible heat flux. The
   advection-aridity method was tested on a daily basis with data for 43
   days collected from a Bat, semi-arid grassland over a 4 month period.
   The influence of each of the terms was examined to determine its
   relative influence in generating the complementary or symmetrical
   structure between actual and potential evapotranspiration. Advection and
   sensible heat flux were found to be very significant, whereas available
   energy was not. A comparison between reference values of
   evapotranspiration E-en obtained from the energy budget with
   measurements of net radiation, ground heat flux, and sensible heat
   fluxes obtained by the eddy correlation method, and evapotranspiration
   estimates from the advection-aridity method, E-aa, produced a small root
   mean square error of 13.1 W m(-2). However, significant bias was present
   in that E-aa overestimated E-en for large values of E-en, but
   underestimated E-en for small values. Measurement error and external
   energy sources not accounted for in the complementary relationship or
   the advection-aridity approach are discussed as potential causes of this
   bias.}},

Abstract = {{Although the Manning equation is widely accepted as the empirical flow
   law for rough turbulent open-channel flow, using the equation in
   practical situations such as slope-area computations is fraught with
   uncertainty because of the difficulty in specifying the value of the
   reach resistance, Manning's n. Riggs (1976, J. Res. US Geol. Surv., 4:
   285-291) found that n was correlated with water-surface slope, and
   proposed a multiple-regression equation that obviates the need for
   estimating n in slope-area estimates of discharge, Because his relation
   was developed from a relatively small sample (N = 62), had potential
   flaws owing to multicollinearity, and was not thoroughly validated, we
   used an expanded data base (N = 520) and objective methods to develop a
   new relation for the same purpose:
   Q=1.564A(1.173)R(0.400)S(-0.0543logS)
   when Q is discharge (m(3) s(-1)), A is cross-sectional area (m(2)), R is
   hydraulic radius (m), and S is water-surface slope, We validated Riggs's
   model and our model using 100 measurements not included in model
   development and found that both give similar results. Riggs's model is
   somewhat better in terms of actual (m(3) s(-1)) error, but ours is
   better in terms of relative (log Q) error. We conclude that either
   Riggs's or our model can be used in place of Manning's equation in
   slope-area computations, but that our model is preferable because it has
   less bias, minimizes multicollinearity, and performs better when applied
   to discharge changes in individual reaches, We also found that our model
   performs better than those of Jarrett (1984, J. Hydraul. Eng., 110:
   1519-1539) or Riggs in the range of applicability of Jarrett's equation
   (0.15 m less than or equal to R less than or equal to 2.13 m; 0.002 less
   than or equal to S less than or equal to 0.052), Both Riggs' s and our
   models significantly overestimate Q in flows satisfying both of the
   following conditions: e < 3 m(3) s(-1) and Froude number less than 0.2.
   For other in-bank Bows in relatively straight reaches, our model can be
   recommended for use in slope-area computations and other applications of
   the Chezy or Manning equations over a wide range of channel sizes (0.41
   m(2) less than or equal to A less than or equal to 8520 m(2)) and slopes
   (0.00001 less than or equal to S less than or equal to 0.0418), thus
   obviating the difficulty of a priori determination of the resistance
   factor.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a 2-D numerical model to simulate both steady-state and
   transient downward water flow through sloping layers in the vadose zone
   with a deep water table. The horizontal flow component obtained with the
   2-D numerical model varies with position along the slope, but was nearly
   the same as the I-D analytical solution once beyond a few meters from
   blocked vertical boundaries at the upper or lower end of the slope.
   Under time-variable precipitation, both the time delay and the peak
   magnitude of the response deep within the profile are not simply
   proportional or in one-to-one correspondence to the strength of each
   rainfall event, but rather depend on the initial moisture status in the
   profile as well as the previous rainfall events. An interesting
   phenomenon for the transient case is that the horizontal flow component
   reversed direction to upslope during the time of heavy rain. This is due
   to the flow pattern near the upper surface boundary !a sloping wetting
   front), and is a consequence of the sloping geometry. Previous studies
   (Warrick et al., 1996) have shown that multidimensional steady-state
   water flow through a sloping interface can essentially be solved by a
   one-dimensional analytical solution for an infinite long slope. The
   simulations suggest that a I-D numerical analysis should also be valid
   for 2-D transient flow cases, if the slope is of sufficient length and
   the point of evaluation is sufficiently far from the beginning or end of
   the slope.}},

   principal axis of hydraulic conductivity, it is shown that the
   dispersivity tensor is rotated away from the how direction in the
   non-Fickian phase, but eventually coincides with the flow direction in
   the Fickian phase.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical analysis proves that El Nino and La Nina an responsible for
   up to 40\% of annual precipitation variations and up to 30\% of river
   discharge variations in Florida. The analysis is based on 44-year
   records of precipitation from more than 30 gauge stations and stream
   discharge from 20 gauge stations distributed all across Florida
   Peninsula. The cross-correlation coefficients for both the sea surface
   temperature (SST) and precipitation data series, the SST and river data
   series are calculated after the SST data series, precipitation and river
   data series are prewhitened by an autoregressive moving average (ARMA)
   model (0, 1), The cross-correlations between the SST anomalies and both
   the precipitation and river discharge are positively significant. The
   conclusion is that a higher annual precipitation amount (a `wet' year)
   is expected from on Fl Nino year, and a lower precipitation amount (a
   `dry' year) is expected from a La Nina year. Large amounts of fresh
   water recharge into the estuary in an Fl Nino year and less fresh water
   recharges into an estuary in a La Nina year. Also a higher groundwater
   table is expected in an Fl Nino year, and a lower groundwater table is
   expected in a La Nina year. Assuming that SST anomalies are the input
   signals for a time-series analysis. the impulse response weights of both
   precipitation and river discharge to SST signals can be calculated due
   to their positive correlations. The impulse response weights can be used
   to build the linear transfer functions of precipitation, river discharge
   and SST signals, The annual precipitation and stream discharge amount
   therefore can be predicted from the SST anomalies. This can provide some
   guidance for the water management policy and planning.}},

Abstract = {{We review the status of research concerning the links between hydrologic
   flowpaths and the biogeochemical environment controlling Nitrogen
   cycling and transport in near-stream saturated zones, centering on
   stream environments of the northern, temperate-forested zone. N
   retention. transformation and mobilization occur in streamside wetlands,
   floodplains, riparian zones, seepage faces. and the hyporheic zone,
   These areas are the focal point in non-point source loading of N to
   stream channels. They also represent areas where rapid changes in
   water-table and hydrologic flowpaths occur Juring rainfall-runoff
   events, It is the combination of an abrupt change in biogeochemical
   environment. encountering a hydrologic boundary (the terrestrial/aquatic
   interface or ecotone,. that make the near-stream/saturated zone critical
   for elucidating controls of N transport and transformation. We review
   published studies concerning the hydrologic controls of N transport in
   near-stream zones. and subsequently present several geomorphic and
   hydrodynamic scenarios relating N biogeochemistry and its response to
   hydrologic events (of both varying magnitude and seasons). It is at the
   critical junction between temporal and spatial conditions affecting N
   cycling in the near-stream zone, that research priorities must now be
   focused.}},

Abstract = {{Water quality is usually monitored on a regular basis at only a small
   number of locations in a catchment, generally focused at the catchment
   outlet. This integrates the effect of all the point and non-point source
   processes occurring throughout the catchment. However, effective
   catchment management requires data which identify major sources and
   processes. As part of a wider study aimed at providing technical
   information for the development of integrated catchment management plans
   for a 5000 km(2) catchment in south eastern Australia, a `snapshot' of
   water quality was undertaken during stable summer flow conditions. These
   low flow conditions exist for long periods so water quality at these
   flow levels is an important constraint on the health of in-stream
   biological communities.
   Over a 4 day period, a study of the low flow water quality
   characteristics throughout the Latrobe River catchment was undertaken.
   Sixty-four sites were chosen to enable a longitudinal profile of water
   quality to be established. All tributary junctions and sites along major
   tributaries, as well as all major industrial inputs were included.
   Samples were analysed for a range of parameters including total
   suspended solids concentration, pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical
   conductivity, turbidity, Bow rate and water temperature. Filtered and
   unfiltered samples were taken from 27 sites along the main stream and
   tributary confluences for analysis of total N, NH4, oxidised N, total P
   and dissolved reactive P concentrations.
   The data are used to illustrate the utility of this sampling methodology
   for establishing specific sources and estimating non-point source loads
   of phosphorous, total suspended solids and total dissolved solids. The
   methodology enabled several new insights into system behaviour including
   quantification of unknown point discharges, identification of key
   in-stream sources of suspended material and the extent to which
   biological activity (phytoplankton growth) affects water quality. The
   costs and benefits of the sampling exercise are reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns the advective migration of an aqueous contaminant in
   a fractured permeable formation. Calculation and analysis refer to
   fractures in which advection velocity is comparatively small. The slow
   advective velocity is created by some local cavities or almost vertical
   orientation of the fractures. It is shown that the advective contaminant
   transport is characterized by two dimensionless parameters: (I) the
   ratio between the permeable block and fracture flow rates, termed the
   `mobility number': (2) the ratio between the longitudinal advection
   velocity of the permeable block flow and that of the fracture flow,
   termed the `advection velocity ratio'.
   For a sufficiently large domain, continuum parameters can be applied to
   characterization of the fractured permeable formation. Then the mixing
   between the permeable block Bow and the fracture Bow is a mechanism
   leading to contaminant dispersion. For very small values of the
   advection velocity ratio, the effective dispersivity is fully determined
   by the mobility number. Its value decreases with increase of the
   mobility number. Under such conditions, the equivalent porosity is
   constant, and its value is identical to that of the permeable blocks. A
   significant value of the advection Velocity ratio increases the
   equivalent porosity of the fractured permeable formation. With regard to
   the effective dispersivity of the domain, if the advection velocity
   ratio is equal to unity then the effective dispersivity vanishes. The
   larger the deviation of the advection velocity from unity, the larger is
   the effective dispersivity of the fractured permeable medium.}},

Abstract = {{The computational burden and instability of the fully 3-D
   saturated-unsaturated unified approach can be lessened considerably by
   using the linked model of the quasi 3-D approach, This approach is
   applicable to a multi-layer subsurface system consisting of aquifers and
   aquitards. In this approach, I-D vertical Bow and solute transport is
   assumed in the vadose zone and aquitards, and 2-D horizontal flow and
   quasi 3-D solute transport are assumed in the aquifers to simulate flow
   and transport in 3-D space. In this paper, the aquifers are sliced into
   sublayers. In an aquifer with 2-D Row, transport in the horizontal
   direction is assumed to be caused by advection and dispersion while
   transport in the vertical direction is assumed to be caused solely by
   dispersion. As a mathematical simplicity, the equations for vertical Bow
   and transport in the vadose zone and confining layers and the equations
   for flow and transport in the aquifer are solved separately in two
   different solution packages. During this time-marching analysis, the
   output in terms of source/sink obtained from one solution package is
   coupled with the equations in the other solution package, This linked
   model quasi 3-D approach was tested with other widely used numerical
   models and analytical solutions, and was found stable and technically
   robust.}},

Abstract = {{The present study deals with precipitation distribution with altitude
   for the Satluj and Beas basins in the western Himalayas. Rainfall
   increases linearly with elevation for both basins in the outer Himalayan
   range. The middle Himalayan range of the Beas basin has exceptionally
   heavy rainfall on the windward side and much less rain (less than half)
   on the leeward side, Rainfall gradients are 106 mm per 100 m to windward
   and 13 mm per 100 m to leeward of this range. Different trends of
   rainfall variation with elevation are observed in different seasons in
   the middle Himalayan range with a linear increase in annual rainfall.
   Rainfall follows an exponential decreasing trend with altitude in the
   greater Himalayan range. Average annual rainfall decreases from the
   outer Himalayas to the greater Himalayas in the Satluj basin. In the
   greater Himalayas, it is about one-sixth of outer Himalayas rainfall.
   Maximum rainfall is in the middle Himalayan range in the Beas basin.
   Monsoon rainfall contributes the largest part of the annual rainfall for
   all the Himalayan ranges. Spatial correlation is higher in the outer
   Himalayas range than in the other ranges.
   Snowfall increases linearly with elevation in the greater Himalayas.
   Snowfall gradients for the Spiti and Baspa sub-basins are 43 mm per 100
   m and 10 mm per 100 m, respectively. The ratio of snowfall to annual
   precipitation varies linearly with altitude. All stations recorded more
   than 60\% snow contribution to annual precipitation. Extrapolation of
   the relationship indicates that snow and rain contribute equally al
   about 2000 m, and all the precipitation occurs as snow above 5000 m.}},

Title = {{The role of surface water redistribution in an area of patterned
   vegetation in a semi-arid environment, south-west Niger}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{198}},
Number = {{1-4}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The surface hydrology of a semi-arid area of patterned vegetation in
   south-west Niger is described. In this region alternating bands of
   vegetation and bare ground aligned along the contours of a gently
   sloping terrain give rise to a phenomenon known as `brousse tigree'
   (tiger bush). At the selected study site the vegetation bands are 10-30
   m wide, separated by 50-100-m-wide bands of bare ground. Five species of
   shrub dominate, Guiera senegalensis, Combretum micranthum, C. nigricans,
   Acacia ataxacantha and A. macrostachya. Herbaceous vegetation is
   generally limited to the upslope edges of vegetation bands.
   A comprehensive field programme was undertaken to investigate the
   hydrology, Topographic, vegetation and surface feature surveys were
   carried out in conjunction with the measurement of rainfall, surface and
   subsurface hydraulic conductivity, particle size and soil moisture
   content.
   Four types of vegetation class are recognised, each tending to occupy a
   constant position relative to the others and to the regional slope. In a
   downslope direction the classes are: bare ground, grassy open bush,
   closed bush, bare open bush, bare ground etc. The nature of the ground
   surface is closely linked to the vegetation class. Over the bare, bare
   open and grassy open classes various types of surface crust are present
   with each type of crust tending to occupy a constant position on the
   regional slope relative to the vegetation class and other crust types.
   Below closed bush crusts are generally absent. The typical downslope
   sequence from the downslope boundary of a vegetation band is: structural
   (sieving) crust -->, erosion crust -->, (gravel crust) --> sedimentation
   crust --> microphytic sedimentation crust --> no crust --> sieving
   crust, etc. It is also shown that these crust types are dynamic and
   evolve from one to the other as hydrological conditions change.
   Hydraulic conductivities of surface crusts are low, typically falling
   within the range 10(-6)-10(-7) m s(-1). The presence of large expanses
   of crust over bare regions tends to generate run-off, which moves down
   the regional slope to be intercepted and pond within and just upslope of
   vegetated areas. Such run-off concentrates rainfall by a factor of up to
   3.7 below vegetated areas. This concentration combined with an absence
   of crust development in closed bush areas promotes rapid infiltration
   below and just upslope of vegetation bands. In this way the hydrology of
   the area operates to ensure that the bulk of the rain which falls is
   directed as quickly as possible to the areas where it is most needed to
   support the existing vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{A 3.7 km flowpath along the main stream channel in Devils Icebox Cave,
   Boone County Missouri, was sampled on 23 January, 23 March and 18
   September 1994. In January 1994, the water was oversaturated with
   respect to both calcite and dolomite. and only minor compositional
   changes were observed along the flowpath. In March 1994, the water was
   oversaturated with respect to calcite but undersaturated with respect to
   dolomite. Using a mass-balance approach, the composition of the stream
   water at downstream locations was predicted by dissolution of dolomite
   ia maximum of 0.16 mmol s(-1)) and by a minor amount of calcite
   precipitation (a maximum of 0.03 mmol s(-1)). In September 1994, there
   were increases in the Mg, Ca, and total inorganic carbon (TIG) mass
   fluxes that were due to the dissolution of dolomite (SIdolomite < 0
   where SI is saturation index) and calcite (SIcalcite < 0). The expected
   composition of the water at downstream locations predicted by a
   mass-balance approach matched the observed composition. When calcite and
   dolomite are dissolving, as on 18 September, the partial pressure of CO2
   of the water should decrease downstream; however, we found an increase
   in the partial pressure of CO2, along the stream. The source of this
   additional CO2 is thought to be microbial degradation of bar guano. The
   decomposition of bat guano appeared to change the composition of the
   stream water during the period the bats are in the cave, and this change
   was reflected in the composition of the stream water collected in
   September 1994. Based on the length of the flowpath and on the average
   velocity of the water along the flowpath, the travel time of water in
   this karst stream is less than 4 days, The reactions that control the
   chemistry of the karst water must be those with equally short
   characteristic times: the dissolution of dolomite and calcite, CO2
   exchange, and microbial degradation of organic matter.}},

Abstract = {{Most previous investigations of the impact of potential climatic change
   on water supply systems have focused on individual systems so that their
   conclusions only apply to a particular system. Recent advances in
   computer technology, regional hydrology and our understanding of water
   supply system behavior allow for examination of the sensitivity of water
   supply system behavior to potential climatic change in a very general
   framework. A regional hydroclimatologic model of annual streamflow is
   developed for the northeastern United States which relates moments of
   annual streamflow to climatic and geomorphic characteristics at 166
   gaging stations, The regional hydroclimatologic streamflow model is then
   combined with analytic relationships among water supply system storage,
   reliability, resilience and yield. The sensitivity of various water
   supply system performance indices such as yield, reliability and
   resilience are derived as a Function of climatic, hydrologic and storage
   conditions, These results allow us to quantify, in general, the
   sensitivity of water supply system behavior to changes in the
   climatologic regime. Case studies for four watersheds in New York and
   one water supply system in Massachusetts indicate that our simple
   regional annual modelling approach can reproduce the results of much
   more detailed site-specific monthly hydroclimatologic modelling
   approaches. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This paper emphasizes the different requirements for calibration and
   validation of lumped and distributed models. On the basis of a
   theoretically founded modelling protocol, the different steps in
   distributed hydrological modelling are illustrated through a case study
   based on the MIKE SHE code and the 440 km(2) Karup catchment in Denmark.
   The importance of a rigorous and purposeful parameterisation is
   emphasized in order to get as few `'free'' parameters as possible for
   which assessments through calibration are required. Calibration and
   validation using a split-sample procedure were carried out for catchment
   discharge and piezometric heads at seven selected observation wells. The
   validated model was then used for two further validation tests. Firstly,
   model simulations were compared with observations from three additional
   discharge sites and four additional wells located within the catchment.
   This internal validation showed significantly poorer results compared to
   the calibration/validation sites. Secondly, the validated model based on
   a 500 m model grid was used to generate three additional models with
   1000 m, 2000 m and 4000 m grids through interpolation of model
   parameters. The results from the multi-scale validation suggested that a
   maximum grid size of 1000 m should be used for simulations of discharge
   and ground-water heads, while the results deteriorated with coarser
   model grids.}},

Abstract = {{The daily precipitation of Bern, Neuchatel and Payerne in Switzerland is
   statistically linked to atmospheric circulation and temperature. For ail
   three stations, there is a marked increase of the mean precipitation
   amount with increasing temperature for wet days with temperatures
   between -5 and 20 degrees C. The amount of precipitation is also
   controlled by the direction and strength of the atmospheric flow. To
   lake these dependencies into account, the daily precipitation amounts
   are modelled as a function of temperature and strength of the flow for
   three categories of flow direction. Both parametric and nonparametric
   techniques from the statistical literature on generalized linear models
   are applied, The nonparametric technique is a helpful tool for the
   selection and evaluation of parametric models. The non-linear effects of
   temperature and strength of the flow on the amount of precipitation are
   described by natural cubic splines and piecewise linear functions. The
   use of the modelled relationships for climate-change scenario production
   is discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Rainfall infiltration influences both the quantity and quality of
   groundwater systems. The knowledge of the process of infiltration
   recharge is of great importance to the management of groundwater systems
   and the hydraulically connected streams. In this study, a response
   function model is developed to estimate soil water flux at the water
   table or the process of infiltration recharge from rainfall and
   evaporation data. The gamma probability density function is modified to
   represent the travel time distribution of infiltrating water by rainfall
   events. The travel time distribution is used to determine the recharge
   process according to the effective infiltration of a rainfall event. The
   effective infiltration is the amount of soil water pushed down into
   groundwater by infiltrating water of a rainfall event and is evaluated
   based on the vadose-zone soil water balance. Superposition is employed
   to compute the recharge rate produced by a sequence of rainfall events.
   Estimations of soil water flux at different groundwater depths are
   compared with lysimetric observations in the field. Good agreements
   between the estimated and observed results confirm the reliability of
   the response function model for predicting infiltration recharge
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{The extent to which water use by trees and crops is complementary in
   agroforestry systems may be affected by the proximity of groundwater to
   the soil surface. This may have important implications for the planning
   and management of agroforestry in semi-arid regions such as the Sahel of
   West Africa, A method of distinguishing uptake of water by plants from
   different sources was used, therefore, at locations with contrasting
   water table levels, to determine whether Azadirachta indica A. Juss
   (neem) trees in windbreaks utilised water from the same depths as
   adjacent crops of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.),
   Comparisons of ratios of the stable isotopes of oxygen ( O-18/O-16) in
   plant sap, groundwater and water in the unsaturated zone of the soil
   profile were made in the Majjia Valley, in south-central Niger, where
   groundwater was found at depths of 6-8 m, and at Sadore in south-western
   Niger, where the water table was at a depth of 35 m.
   In the Majjia Valley, the trees obtained large portions of their water
   from surface layers of the soil only after rain, when water there was
   abundant. During dry periods, roots of the trees extracted groundwater
   or deep reserves of soil water, while the millet crop extracted water
   from closer to the top of the soil profile. In contrast, at Sadore, both
   the trees and crop fulfilled their water requirements from the top 2-3 m
   of the soil throughout the year. Thus, utilisation of water by windbreak
   trees and crops is more complementary where groundwater is accessible to
   tree roots. Competition for water is likely reduced at such locations as
   a consequence, but may affect the productivity of windbreak systems
   where groundwater is inaccessible. To maximise the benefits of
   establishing windbreaks, therefore, it is important that planners
   recommend strategies for reducing competition for water between trees
   and crops at sites where groundwater cannot be reached by tree roots.}},

Abstract = {{The contamination of shallow aquifers by elevated nitrate concentrations
   is a common problem in many rural regions of the world. Aquifers under
   irrigated land are especially susceptible to this type of contamination.
   An intensive three-dimensional investigation of water chemistry was
   undertaken in a shallow unconfined sand aquifer in an area of intensive
   irrigation in Mason County, Illinois, in order to investigate processes
   affecting water quality. Results reveal considerable heterogeneity in
   the aqueous chemistry in three spatial dimensions and temporally.
   Recharge is rapid in this system and the water chemistry of the recharge
   water is variable both spatially and temporally, being especially
   influenced by agricultural practices. Nitrate concentrations are
   elevated in a zone between about 6 and 10 m beneath the surface,
   although in certain areas and at certain times this zone was not found.
   The maximum nitrate concentrations in this zone were slightly greater
   than 20 mg 1(-1) as N, well. above the US Environmental Protection
   Agency's maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 10 ms 1(-1). Nitrate was
   generally absent both above and below this depth in the aquifer. Water
   relatively depleted in nitrate recharges the aquifer from the surface at
   the site, producing a zone of dilute water near the water table. Beneath
   the plume. denitrification reactions are responsible for removing
   nitrate from solution. probably mainly coupled to oxidation of sulfide
   minerals; tritium data suggest that vertical movement of solutes is
   rapid and thus there has been enough time to transport surface-applied
   fertilizer to depths in excess of 30 m in the aquifer. This rapid
   vertical movement is almost certainly enhanced by intensive irrigation
   in the county. A number of aqueous species and chemical parameters (Ca,
   Mg, Sr, Fe, Si, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIG), dissolved oxygen,
   total dissolved solids. and pH) are correlated with nitrate
   concentrations, primarily because, like nitrate, they are either a
   significant fraction of fertilizers of are redox-sensitive. Drinking
   water quality is generally not degraded by fertilizer applications in
   this area, because almost all drinking-water wells are screened well
   below the zone of elevated nitrate concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{The modelling of hillslope hydrology is of great importance not only for
   the reason that all non-plain, i.e. hilly or mountainous, landscapes can
   be considered as being composed of a mosaic of hillslopes. A hillslope
   model may also be used for both research purposes and for
   application-oriented, detailed, hillslope-scale hydrological studies in
   conjunction with related scientific disciplines such as geotechnics,
   gee-chemistry and environmental technology. Despite the current limited
   application of multi-process and multi-dimensional hydrological models
   (particularly at the hillslope scale), hardly any comprehensive model
   has been available for operational use.
   In this paper we introduce a model which considers most of the relevant
   hillslope hydrological processes. Some recent applications are described
   which demonstrate its ability to narrow the stated gap in hillslope
   hydrological modelling. The modelling system accounts for the
   hydrological processes of interception, evapotranspiration,
   infiltration, soil-moisture movement (where the Bow processes can be
   modelled in three dimensions), surface runoff, subsurface stormflow and
   stream-flow discharge. The relevant process interactions are also
   included. Special regard has been given to consideration of
   state-of-the-art knowledge concerning rapid soilwater Bow processes
   during storm conditions (e.g. macropore infiltration, lateral subsurface
   stormflow, return flow) and to its transfer to and inclusion within an
   operational modelling scheme.
   The model is `'physically based'' in the sense that its parameters have
   a physical meaning and can be obtained or derived from field
   measurements. This somewhat weaker than usual definition of a physical
   basis implies that some of the sub-models (still) contain empirical
   components, that the effects of the high spatial and temporal
   variability found in nature cannot always be expressed within the
   various physical laws, i.e. that the laws are scale dependent, and that
   due to limitations of measurements and data processing, one can express
   only averaged and incomplete data conditions.
   Several applications demonstrate the reliable performance of the model
   for one-, two- and three-dimensional simulations. The described examples
   of application are part of a comprehensive erosion and agro-chemical
   transport study in a loessy agricultural catchment in southwestern
   Germany, and of a study on the sealing efficacy of capillary barriers in
   landfill covers. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The Bengal drainage basin is geologically one of the youngest and
   tectonically most active denudation regimes of the world, and
   encompasses the total lower reaches of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna
   (GEM) drainage basin. The GEM river system contributes around 4.5\% of
   the total annual global freshwater flux to the oceans. The solute load
   of the GEM river system is dominated by the carbonate weathering
   products of the transport-limited denudation regime. However, in the
   Meghna basin, which drains a mountainous region, silicate weathering is
   slightly more predominant, and the solute load tends to be more
   influenced by the atmospheric contribution. The river system represents
   about 5\% (152 x 10(6) t yr-1) of the annual global chemical flux to the
   world's oceans. The chemical denudation rate of the GBM system in the
   Bengal basin, is one of the world's highest (79-114 t km(-2) yr(-1)).
   suggesting intensive weathering and erosion in the drainage basin both
   in Bangladesh as well as in the hinterlands of India and China. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{To investigate the seasonal changes of infiltration rates, measurements
   by means of simulated rainfall experiments and cylinder infiltrometer
   were done in a small E-W oriented watershed in Southeast Spain. Data
   were collected during both the wet seasons (autumn, winter and spring)
   and the dry season (summer). Infiltration rates were very high in
   summer, when direct surface runoff is very low. During the wet seasons,
   the infiltration rates were lower due to the increase in soil moisture.
   Measurements by means of both pending as well as simulated rainfall are
   suitable to study the infiltration process. The former needs more
   replications, due to the small observation area encompassed for each
   experiment. Rainfall simulation experiments are more realistic and
   accurate, but also more sophisticated and costly. The rates measured by
   means of a cylinder infiltrometer were 8.5 times higher than by
   simulated rainfall at an intensity of 55 mm h(-1).
   Under simulated rainfall it was found that the soils with lower
   infiltration rates have greater seasonal infiltration changes. The soils
   of the north-facing slope always show high infiltration rates (49 mm
   h(-1)), while those of the south-facing slope have lower infiltration
   rates (27 mm h(-1)). Seasonal changes of infiltration rates play an
   important role in soil and slope hydrology in semiarid environments.
   During summer surface runoff was not observed on vegetation covered
   soils, and runoff rates were only 10\% of the rainfall on the bare
   surfaces. During the wet season, especially in autumn, runoff
   coefficients were equal to 0.3 on bare surfaces, and on the vegetated
   surfaces runoff was negligible.}},

Abstract = {{A Row and mass transport mathematical model has been calibrated to
   simulate piezometric head and chloride evolution in the Llobregat delta
   confined aquifer. A twenty-year period (1965 - 1985) is simulated with
   monthly time steps. Automatic estimation of flow and transport
   parameters are obtained by means of a code that simulates Bow and mass
   transport of constant density fluids, In this case, density differences
   owing to groundwater salinity changes by marine intrusion can be
   neglected because the aquifer thickness is relatively small and because
   both the horizontal density gradient and the aquifer dip are small.
   Calibration of the flow problem leads to an excellent fit between
   measured and computed heads, which, however, can be obtained with
   different transmissivity patterns, When switching to the transport
   problem, best results in terms of concentration fits are obtained by
   associating the seawater intrusion plumes with high transmissivity zones
   that fan be attributed to palaeochannels. In short, transient head and
   concentration data have been used jointly for automatic calibration of a
   regional model, which has proven advantageous both because it
   facilitates model selection and because it has led to a model with an
   improved conceptual basis. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Selection of a probability distribution for annual maximum discharges
   was carried through exploratory and confirmatory stages. The L-moment
   diagram was applied first in order to screen out inappropriate candidate
   distributions. The Anderson-Darling test was then applied in order to
   examine the descriptive performance of screened distributions. The
   effectiveness of this two-stage procedure was studied on an ensemble of
   diverse annual maximum discharge series recorded in Israel. The
   Generalized Pareto distribution was the only one of a number of
   candidate distributions whose theoretical relationship between L-moments
   followed closely enough the actual relationships in the case study. This
   distribution was well fitted to about one half of the discharge series,
   and satisfactorily fitted to the entire ensemble. It was concluded that
   such a two-stage procedure, which applies quantitative measures in both
   stages, would reduce the subjectivity involved with the selection of a
   probability distribution, thus improving the credibility of predicted
   high discharges. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to introduce an alternative to the
   matching strip, correlation and parameter-averaging methods for deriving
   master recession characteristics from a set of recession segments, and
   to apply the method to streamflow recession segments for a small
   forested catchment in which baseflow is provided by drainage of the
   saturated zone in the shallow permeable soil. The method involves
   fitting conceptual storage-outflow models using an iterative algorithm.
   Diagnostic plots revealed that the recessions were non-linear and that
   the recessions did not follow a common single-valued storage-outflow
   relation. A model involving two linear reservoirs provided substantially
   better fit than three single-reservoir models, indicating that the form
   of the recession curve probably depends not just on the volume of
   subsurface storage, but also on its initial distribution amongst
   reservoirs. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of a change in channel morphology of a stream upon flood
   flows may be obliterated by simultaneous changes in meteorologic factors
   or in another physiographic factor and thus flood-frequency analysis and
   statistical tests cannot be seen as definitely indicating the lack or
   existence of a genetic non-stationarity of flow record related to the
   channel change. In a study of two mountain rivers from the upper Vistula
   drainage basin, southern Poland, three alternative procedures are
   presented which analyse temporal trends in the relationship between
   inflow and outflow peak discharges of flood waves passing the modified
   reach. While these techniques examine various aspects of the record of
   flood discharges, all of them separate changes in flows accomplished in
   a reach under investigation from those born in the upstream part of the
   catchment. Annual maxima analysis allows direct comparison of the timing
   and relations between changes in channel morphology and their response
   in flood flows. The high consistency of changes in vertical channel
   position of the analysed rivers and of variations in transformation of
   their flood flows shows the importance of channel incision for
   increasing flood hazard on channelized streams. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study deals exclusively with the behavior of the oxygen-18 and
   deuterium composition of precipitation, surface water and groundwater
   within and near the basin of Mexico. It reviews 16 studies from 1974 to
   1993, reporting new measurements related to the study area. Location
   maps and the summary of original conclusions are included. Parts of the
   documents, whose circulation is restricted, were collected from private
   files and government libraries. These data, which were not previously
   available to the scientific community, represent a total of 791
   oxygen-18 and 703 deuterium analyses, mast of them (delta(18)O, delta D)
   pairs. The discussion is an overview of the whole data set, with
   interpretation. As inferred from the data, regional precipitation
   follows the regression delta D = 7.97 delta(18)O + 11.03 (n = 85; r(2) =
   0.97), being slightly different from a local meteoric line previously
   published; variations in delta(18)O are about -21.7 to -1.3 parts per
   thousand, following a Gaussian distribution: f(delta(18)O) = 0.036
   exp{[}-0.5(delta(18)O + 9.97)/(4.43)]. Groundwater from springs and deep
   production wells fitted the new regional meteoric line; variations in
   delta(18)O are about -13.5 to -6.5 parts per thousand, and their
   distribution is also Gaussian: f(delta(18)O) = 0.248
   exp{[}-0.5(delta(18)O + 10.09)/(0.81)]. Shallow piezometer and pore
   saline waters in the sediments of the farmer terminal marsh of the study
   basin showed a trend of isotopic alteration; this feature is interpreted
   by the corresponding source study as mixing of in situ post-1953
   infiltration with older evaporated waters. This mixing trend intersects
   the regional meteoric line close to delta(18)O = - 8.0 parts per
   thousand. Isotope data and our interpretation are consistent with the
   current concept of a closed groundwater basin associated with the closed
   surface water basin of Mexico.}},

Abstract = {{A parallel algorithm for solving streamflow prediction problems using
   distributed models is proposed and analyzed. The expanding utilization
   of distributed hydrologic models for the realtime prediction of floods
   and flash floods and for hydroclimatic studies provides the impetus for
   the study. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm, as compared to
   ordinary sequential algorithms, as well as the detailed parametric
   influence on the performance of the algorithm are investigated. First,
   theoretical results for the speedup of the parallel algorithm are
   obtained for a simple stream network of a typical flash flood prone
   basin, and then they are extended to include a larger, well developed
   network of streams. In the latter case, the results are given as
   functions of geomorphological characteristics of the stream network and
   of the cost of generic procedures for soil water accounting and for
   channel routing. It is shown that when the number of parallel processors
   is not limiting, parallel processing is much more cost effective than
   sequential processing for stream networks of a high order. It is also
   shown that the algorithm performs better for higher bifurcation ratios
   and lower average-length ratios. Performance improves as the ratio of
   the computational cost of channel routing to that of soil water
   accounting is reduced. The algorithm is tested experimentally for a
   flash-flood prone basin in Ohio using an ENCORE parallel computer,
   yielding satisfactory results. Guidelines are provided for partitioning
   the drainage basins in a particular application, as well as for
   developing parallel software. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Title = {{Estimating fluctuation quantities from time series of water-table depths

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Volume = {{197}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{25-46}},

Abstract = {{A method is developed to estimate fluctuation quantities of water-table
   depths independently of the precipitation excess during the monitoring
   period, whose length is generally limited to 4-10 years. For this
   purpose, one-dimensional models are calibrated with the precipitation
   excess as an input variable. These models include the SWATRE soil
   moisture accounting model, supplemented with a stochastic model for the
   noise series, and transfer function-noise (TFN) models. The models are
   used to simulate realizations of time series of water-table depths with
   lengths of 30 years, from which the mean highest and mean lowest
   water-tables (MHW and MLW, respectively) are calculated. These estimates
   can be used in water management for making strategic decisions, because
   they reflect the conditions of the prevailing climate (i.e. average
   weather conditions over, say, 30 years) and not just the meteorological
   conditions during the groundwater monitoring period, which is usually of
   limited length. The results show that MHWs and MLWs which are estimated
   from an 8-year series may deviate more than 20 cm from those estimated
   from 30-year series. The results of the SWATRE models and the TFN models
   differ only slightly, despite having clearly different theoretical
   starting-points. The minimum length of series needed for calibration is
   of practical value; stationary series of 4 years were generally found to
   be sufficiently long to model the dynamic systems in this study
   adequately. Both SWATRE models and TFN models could be improved in order
   to obtain a constant residual variance: in SWATRE models hysteresis of
   the soil water characteristics could be incorporated, whereas in TFN
   models a non-constant variance of watertable depths could be taken into
   account. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A series of six ancient connected lakes occupied the broad plain of the
   closed Basin of Mexico. This study pertains to two of these lakes. O-18,
   H-2 and chemical patterns in the pore water of the broad aquitard formed
   from sediment in these lakes indicate that the origin of this paleo-lake
   water was local meteoric water, which entered the ancient lakes as
   runoff, and groundwater from springs. Evaporation of surface water in
   the former Chalco Lake caused concentration of dissolved salts and
   enrichment in the heavy isotopes O-18 and H-2. During high water
   periods, the south easternmost ancient Lake Chalco fed partially
   evaporated water to the closed Lake Texcoco, the lowest of the lakes,
   where further evaporation occurred causing higher concentration of salts
   and enrichment of heavy isotopes. These major ions and stable isotopes
   follow the evaporation trends characteristic of closed or nearly closed
   evaporatic basins elsewhere in the world. Paleo-lake evaporation lines
   in Lakes Chalco and Texcoco originated from the same starting water and
   developed as a consequence of the topographic position of the former
   lakes and local climatological conditions. A modern evaporation line
   developed after the drainage of the lakes, reflecting evaporation of
   modern infiltrating meteoric water, The presence of brackish pore water
   in most of the Chalco aquitard, which has a maximum thickness of 300 m,
   indicates that upward vertical groundwater flow has not been capable of
   displacing the paleo-lake water. This suggests that vertical advection
   was not significant through out the hundreds of thousands of years of
   existence of the aquitard sediments, One-dimensional numerical
   simulations of the deeper part of the O-18 profile representing the
   thicker part of the aquitard sediments, 140 m, showed that this profile
   was developed by molecular diffusion with a small upward advective flux,
   where apparently the Chalco aquitard always had enriched brackishwater
   overlying the fresh water aquifer. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{To improve the understanding of interactions between the boreal forest
   and the climate system as a key issue for global climate change, the
   water budget of a mixed pine and spruce forest in central Sweden was
   estimated by measurements of the water flux components and the total
   evaporation flux during the period 16 May-31 October 1995. Total
   evaporation was measured using eddy correlation and the components were
   obtained using measurements of precipitation, throughfall, tree
   transpiration, and forest floor evaporation, On a daily basis, tree
   transpiration was the dominant evaporation component during the
   vegetation period. However, it could be efficiently blocked by a wet
   canopy associated with large interception evaporation. The accumulated
   total evaporation was 399 mm, transpiration was 243 mm, forest float
   evaporation was 56 mm and interception evaporation was 74 mm, The
   accumulated sum of interception, transpiration, and floor evaporation
   was 51 mm larger than the actual measured total evaporation. This
   difference was mainly attributed to the fact that transpiration was
   measured in a rather dense 50-year-old stand while total evaporation
   represented the average conditions of older, roughly 100-year-old
   stands. To compare eddy-correlation measurements with small-scale
   measurements of evaporation components, a source area analysis was made
   to select the flux data that give the best representation of the
   investigated stand. Especially under stable atmospheric conditions the
   requirements for surface homogeneity were very high and extreme care had
   to be taken to be aware of the flux source areas. Canopy water storage
   was determined by two methods: by the water balance of the canopy, which
   gave a result of 3.3 mm; and by the so-called minimum method based on
   plots of throughfall versus precipitation, which gave a much lower value
   of 1.5 mm. Seasonal interception evaporation constituted 30\% of the
   precipitation. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Current models for simulation of water flow and solute transport through
   the vadose zone are limited in their applicability to field-scale
   problems, On the one hand, most of the models lack the capability to
   account for naturally existing soil spatial heterogeneity and complex
   (bio)chemical processes that many solutes undergo, and on the other, use
   of certain types of the existing models is often not economically
   feasible, In the present study, stochastic simulation techniques were
   applied to GLEAMS, a deterministic vadose zone solute transport model,
   to simulate soil water changes and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations at
   various depths in the top 1.2 m heterogeneous soil profiles of three
   research plots in southern Ohio. Simulations were conducted at three
   levels of complication: (1) single-value output was obtained for each
   plot by running GLEAMS with plot-based mean values of soil parameters;
   (2) a prediction band was formed from the output probability density
   function (pdf) with selected soil properties described by a
   multi-variate normal (MVN) random vector for each plot; and (3) with
   each plot decomposed into sub-environments, a prediction band was formed
   from all output pdfs obtained using MVNs for every sub-environment.
   Predicted and observed soil water contents and nitrate concentrations
   were compared to evaluate model performance, Overall, the predicted
   long-term means from all simulations fit the long-term means of field
   observations well, However, stochastic simulation at the sub-environment
   level showed two distinct merits over the other two approaches: (1) it
   better predicted variations in soil water content and nitrate
   concentration at a plot scale; and (2) it had the capability of locating
   high-risk areas at a sub-environment scale. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{MAGIC-WAND (Model of Acidification of Groundwaters In Catchments-With
   Aggregated Nitrogen Dynamics) has been specifically developed for wide
   application and scenario assessment. It maintains the sulphur driven
   acid/base chemistry dynamics of MAGIC, and considers in addition the
   impacts of changes in nitrogen deposition from the atmosphere and
   changes in nitrogen utilisation within the catchment. The model uses
   estimates of nitrification, mineralisation, N fixation and
   denitrification and changes in these soil processes through time. Plant
   uptake is nonlinear and dependant upon inorganic nitrogen concentrations
   in soil solution.
   Calibration of the model requires specification of values for the soil N
   fluxes and for the parameters which describe the hyperbolic uptake
   function. Literature data can provide ranges for these values but
   specific catchment related values are not obtainable since the model is
   conceptual. Selection of uptake parameters must reflect current
   catchment vegetation and vegetation change through time, and this has
   been investigated at a catchment in SW Scotland, Changes in soil
   processes through time are also important to model functioning, but are
   not considered in this study.
   The model has been applied to 25 acid sensitive (Acid Neutralising
   Capacity (ANC) < 50 mu eq l(-1)) lochs in SW Scotland to examine the
   interaction of afforestation and changes in nitrogen deposition,
   assuming recently agreed reductions in sulphur deposition. The model
   results suggest that a 50\% reduction in nitrogen deposition coupled
   with agreed sulphur reductions is not sufficient to promote
   reversibility of acidification at the most sensitive sites within 15
   years. Increased nitrogen deposition in conjunction with agreed sulphur
   reductions will most likely cause continued acidification at afforested
   lochs in the region. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{To model the suspended sediment transport through the Mackenzie River
   Delta, Northwest Territories, Canada, a one-dimensional multi-channel
   suspended sediment model (FOSH-MC) has been developed. The model links
   an established network flow model that has been successfully applied to
   the Mackenzie Delta with an existing suspended sediment model. Sediment
   travel times along channels, that are useful to establish suspended
   sediment sampling schedules, are estimated as a model output product.
   The sediment output also includes total loads at each network node and
   reaches suspended sediment concentrations. The model can route both
   cohesive and nan-cohesive suspended sediment.
   This research is a first attempt to dynamically model sediment transport
   through the Mackenzie Delta. All previous efforts have examined
   long-term fluxes. The FOSH-MC model has the potential to trace the
   pathways of contaminants through the Mackenzie Delta. The model also has
   the potential to be applied to other multi-channel networks that
   primarily carry suspended sediment. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Finite-difference simulations of mise-a-la-masse electrical flow through
   conductive contaminant plumes show that the approximate dimensions of a
   plume and the approximate location of its center of mass can be derived
   from the resulting electrical potential fields. Contaminant plumes that
   exhibit `Gaussian' (statistically normal) concentration distributions
   form trending heterogeneities with respect to electrical conductivity.
   These plumes are relatively poor conductors with electrical conductivity
   decreasing continuously with distance outward from the contaminant
   source in the directions of plume migration. Thus, electrical flow from
   a single, current electrode placed in the source of a contaminant plume
   refracts continuously with distance from the source as the current flows
   preferentially through the plume. Chances in the electrical potential
   field that occur at the land surface due to the presence of an evolving
   plume can be used to monitor the growth of the plume. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Simulated annealing is used to calibrate a conceptual rainfall-runoff
   model (a modification of Boughton's SFB model) by fitting modelled
   monthly runoff to historical data. The problem to be solved is that of
   finding the global minimum of a multivariate function that has many
   extraneous local minima, a situation in which conventional optimisation
   methods are ineffective. The model estimates runoff from daily rainfall
   and daily potential evaporation estimates for a catchment. The 25
   catchments used for the study cover a wide range of climatic types,
   including humid tropical, humid subtropical, arid, semiarid,
   Mediterranean and marine west-coast. The catchments differ in the number
   and type of model processes activated, which is indicated by the
   parameters fitted. A parsimonious approach was adopted where only the
   sensitive model parameters for a catchment were fitted. The objective
   function which quantifies discrepancies between the computed and
   observed streamflows was carefully selected to satisfy the least squares
   assumptions. Finally, a case study is presented to illustrate the
   fitting process and highlight some of the difficulties that may be
   encountered. It is shown that simulated annealing is able to fit six or
   seven sensitive parameters of the modified SFB model by locating the
   global minimum of the objective function. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{It is proposed that the drainage network plays an important role in the
   recharge process of the fractured aquifers in the African Precambrian
   shield and that the fractured aquifer system is likely to be
   hydraulically continuous; this contrasts with most previous studies,
   which suggested direct recharge by rainwater percolation. Two areas were
   selected in Niger for the study of the aquifer recharge process using
   isotopic analyses of water (H-2, O-18, H-3). The first area, centred on
   the village of Kobio, is the 21-km(2) drainage basin of the Lomona
   intermittent stream, some 60 km southwest of Niamey (the capital city of
   Niger). The second area, in the vicinity of Niamey, represents a portion
   of the Niger basin, draining a surface area many orders of magnitude
   larger than the Lomona basin, The mean O-18 composition of water from
   all wells in the Kobio aquifer provides evidence for recharge by
   evaporated water, This is confirmed by the concomitant increase of O-18
   content with rising static water levels as recharge proceeded. Tritium
   data suggest progressive aging of the Kobio aquifer water in the flow
   direction inferred from static water levels, with a down-gradient
   depletion of O-18 composition, suggesting that `enriched' recharge water
   is progressively mixed with `depleted' aquifer water, Recharge by a
   reach of the Lomona is proposed to explain these results, In the Niamey
   area wells, the O-18 time series clearly define an injection of
   evaporated water from the surface into the fractured aquifer. This
   recharging plume of evaporated water most likely originates from the
   Niger River. Thus, isotope data for two drainage basins of very
   different sizes indicate that aquifers are recharged by water from the
   rivers and that the flow regime of surface waters controls the recharge
   process. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

   model outputs are considered, namely the simple average method (SAM),
   the weighted average method (WAM) and the neural network method (NNM).
   The estimated discharges of five rainfall-runoff models for 11
   catchments are used to test the performance of these three combination
   methods. The results confirm that better discharge estimates can be
   obtained by combining the model outputs of different models. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{A methodology for developing regional parameter estimation equations,
   designed for application to continental scale river basins, is
   described. The approach, which is applied to the two-layer Variable
   Infiltration Capacity (VIC-2L) land surface hydrologic model, uses a set
   of 34 unregulated calibration or `'training'' catchments (drainage areas
   10(2)-10(4) km(2)) distributed throughout the Arkansas-Red River basin
   of the south central U.S. For each of these catchments, parameters were
   determined by: a) prior estimation of two of the model parameters
   (saturated hydraulic conductivity and pore size distribution index) from
   the U.S. Soil Conservation Service State Soil Geographic Data Base
   (STATSGO) data base; and b) estimation of the remaining seven parameters
   via a search procedure that minimizes the sum of squares of differences
   between predicted and observed streamflow. The catchment parameters were
   then related to 11 ancillary distributed land surface characteristics
   extracted from STATSGO, and 17 variables derived from station
   meteorological data. The seven regression equations explained from 54 to
   76\% of the variance of the parameters, The most frequently occurring
   ancillary variables were the average permeability, saturated hydraulic
   conductivity, and SCS hydrologic Group B (typically soils with
   moderately high infiltration rates) fraction derived from STATSGO, and
   the average temperature and standard deviation of fall precipitation.
   The method was tested by comparing simulations using the regional
   (regression equation) parameters for six unregulated catchments not in
   the parameter estimation set, The model performance using the regional
   parameters was quite good for most of the calibration and validation
   catchments, which were humid and semi-humid. The model did not perform
   as well for the smaller number of arid to semi-arid catchments. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Two applications of a grid network version of the two-layer variable
   infiltration capacity (VIC-2L) land surface hydrology model applied at
   one degree resolution to the Arkansas-Red River basin are compared. In
   the first application, gridded parameter fields were linearly
   interpolated from locally estimated parameters (via a search procedure)
   at a set of 40 unregulated catchments distributed throughout the
   Arkansas-Red River basin with long-term gage records. In the second
   application, the grid network model was run using the same precipitation
   and potential evapotranspiration as in the first application, but with
   parameters transferred to the large area grid from the gaged catchments
   via regression of the locally estimated parameters on catchment soils,
   topographic, and climatological characteristics. In both cases, the
   model was run at a daily time-step, and vegetation parameters were tired
   (with prescribed seasonal variation but no interannual variation in the
   case of leaf area index). Generally, the simulations based on the
   regional regression transfer scheme performed significantly better than
   those based on the interpolated parameters; at the mouth of the Arkansas
   the absolute simulation error for annual flows was reduced from 7.3 to
   1.3\%, and for the Red, it was reduced from 12 to 1.7\%. However, the
   basin-wide annual evapotranspiration and its seasonal cycle were
   relatively insensitive to the hydrological parameter estimation schemes.

Abstract = {{On the east coast of South Andros Island, Bahamas, a major bank-marginal
   fracture system characterised by vertically extensive cavern systems
   (blue holes) is developed sub-parallel to the steep-sided deepwater
   re-entrant of the Tongue of the Ocean. In addition to providing a
   discharge route for meteoric, mixed and geochemically evolved saline
   groundwaters, a strong local circulation occurs along the fracture
   system. This generates enhanced vertical mixing within voids of the
   fracture system, evidenced by the increasing mixing zone thickness, and
   the thinning and increasing salinity of brackish lens waters from north
   to south along the fracture system. Furthermore, tidally driven pumping
   of groundwaters occurs between the fracture and adjacent carbonate
   aquifer affecting a zone up to 200 m either side of the fracture.
   The resultant mixing of groundwaters of contrasting salinity and P-CO2
   within and along the fracture system and with the surrounding aquifer
   waters, together with bacterial oxidation of organic matter, generates
   significant potential for locally enhanced diagenesis. Undersaturation
   with respect to calcite within the fresh (or brackish)-salt water mixing
   zone is observed in the fracture system and predicted in the adjacent
   aquifer, while mixing between the brackish fracture lens and surrounding
   high P-CO2 fresh waters causes dissolution of aragonite but not calcite.
   The latter gives rise to considerable secondary porosity development,
   because active tidal pumping ensures continued renewal of dissolutional
   potential. This is evidenced by calcium and strontium enrichment in the
   brackish lens which indicates porosity generation by aragonite
   dissolution at a maximum rate of 0.35\% ka(-1), up to twice the average
   estimated for the fresh water lens. In contrast saline groundwaters are
   depleted in calcium relative to open ocean waters suggesting the
   formation of calcite cements.
   The development of a major laterally continuous cavernous fracture zone
   along the margin of the carbonate platform permits enhanced groundwater
   flow and mixing which may result in generation of a diagenetic `halo' at
   a scale larger than that generally recognised around syn-sedimentary
   fractures in fossil carbonates. This may be characterised by increased
   secondary porosity where a relative fall in sea-level results in
   exposure and formation of a meteoric groundwater system, or cementation
   by `marine' calcite both below this meteoric system, and where the bank
   surface is flooded by seawater. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Ground penetrating radar (GPR) can provide information on the soil water
   content of the unsaturated zone in sandy deposits via measurements from
   the surface, and so avoids drilling. Proof of this was found from
   measurements of radar wave velocities carried out ten times over 13
   months at two test sites in the Netherlands. At these same locations and
   on the same dates, soil water content was measured in access tubes using
   a capacitance probe. Comparison of GPR and capacitance probe
   observations revealed that:
   1. the inferred absolute values of soil water content agree well. This
   is remarkable because the soil water content is deduced entirely
   differently for the two methods.
   2. Seasonal fluctuations in soil water content established for different
   (general) depth zones of radar waves correlate well with the
   fluctuations observed in the access tubes.
   3. The various methods to determine the propagation velocities of radar
   waves are complementary; together thy produce a realistic and reasonably
   complete image of the vertical distribution of the soil water content of
   the entire unsaturated zone. High-frequency (200 MHz) direct groundwaves
   and refracted waves constitute a particularly attractive complementary
   combination, which provides information on consecutive shallow zones in
   the underground, i.e. the zones of major-soil water content
   fluctuations.
   4. Lateral variations established at one of the test sites where several
   access tubes have been placed in a transect also follow from the GPR
   measurements along that profile; this non-destructive determination of
   soil water content in practically continuous and detailed sections is
   one of the great assets of GPR, opening the way to mapping preferential
   soil water flow paths. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Florida Bay carbonate mud islands are known to be sites of Holocene
   diagenesis, including dolomitization, and the hydrology is an essential
   component of this process. On Cluett Key, a typical mud island in
   western Florida Bay, groundwater salinities range to 145 parts per
   thousand beneath a shallow ephemeral pond which occupies 70\% of the
   island. A sharp hydrostratigraphic boundary separates low-permeability
   unconsolidated carbonate mud from underlying highly permeable
   Pleistocene limestone. We report the results of a 2 year project aimed
   at determining the rates, patterns, and driving force of groundwater
   flow beneath the island.
   Water level measurements are used to demonstrate the presence of a large
   hydraulic head drive caused by the difference in elevations of the pond
   and Florida Bay, and enhanced by the higher density of groundwaters in
   the carbonate mud compared with groundwater in the limestone. The
   hydraulic head drive is essentially vertical because Florida Bay water
   levels are transmitted with little attenuation to the limestone
   underlying the island. Distributions of groundwater density and pore
   pressures are consistent with vertical groundwater flow. Based on an
   estimated vertical hydraulic conductivity of approximately 5 x 10(-3) m
   day(-1), vertical interstitial velocities are on the order of 25 cm
   year(-1) with a residence time in the carbonate mud of approximately 15
   years. This velocity is very similar to that calculated independently
   from tritium concentrations in pore waters.
   Both horizontal and vertical density gradients exist in the carbonate
   mud. These density variations induce circulations owing to vorticity and
   may lead to the formation of instability plumes (reflux), but dynamical
   scaling suggests that these motions are much slower than those induced
   by the dominant hydraulic drive. Buoyancy effects may, however, be
   dominant on other lower islands in Florida Bay where the hydraulic head
   drive is much smaller than on Cluett Key. Diffusion may blur sharp
   gradients in salt, Ca2+, or Mg2+, but is not an important vehicle for
   wholesale movement of these species through the island.
   Cluett Key shares some similarities with Holocene carbonate atoll
   islands: the two-layer hydrostratigraphy, and transmission of tidal
   signals under the island. In contrast to atoll islands, however,
   groundwater flow on Cluett Key is governed by transmission of the mean
   sea level to the base of the Holocene. Basal tidal fluctuations induce
   little mixing in the low-permeability Holocene sediments. In addition,
   the groundwater on Cluett Key is dominantly oceanic, not meteoric, and
   is consequently denser than underlying groundwater. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A distributed model for the simulation of the water budget and
   prediction of the sediment yield in Alpine catchments is presented, The
   strongly variable landscape typical of Alpine regions was schematically
   represented through a raster of square cells. The hydrological phenomena
   were modelled at this cell scale, A well-gauged Alpine catchment was
   selected to validate the model. A catchment digital terrain model (DTM)
   was created through an automatic treatment of the catchment contour
   lines, selected stream lines, and soil and vegetation cover maps. Water
   and sediment routing to the catchment outlet was performed by
   integrating simplified versions of the equations of continuity and
   motion for both water and sediment. The governing equations were
   integrated and calibrated on a monthly time scale by using available
   field data on rainfall, discharge and sediment yield at the catchment

Abstract = {{Agricultural chemicals in surface water may constitute a human health
   risk or have adverse effects on aquatic life. Recent research on
   unregulated rivers in the midwestern USA documents that elevated
   concentrations of herbicides occur for 1-4 months following application
   in late spring and early summer, In contrast, nitrate concentrations in
   unregulated rivers are elevated during fall, winter, and spring months.
   Natural and anthropogenic variables of river drainage basins, such as
   soil permeability, amount of agricultural chemicals applied, or
   percentage of land planted in corn, affect agricultural chemical
   concentration and mass transport in rivers.
   Presented is an analysis of selected data on agricultural chemicals
   collected for three regional studies conducted by the US Geological
   Survey. Statistical techniques such as multiple linear and logistic
   regression were used to identify natural and anthropogenic variables of
   drainage basins that have strong relations to agricultural chemical
   concentrations and mass transport measured in rivers. A geographic
   information system (GIS) was used to manage and analyze spatial data,
   Statistical models were developed that estimated the concentration,
   annual transport, and annual mean concentration of selected agricultural
   chemicals in midwestern rivers.
   Multiple linear regression models were not very successful (R-2 from
   0.162 to 0.517) in explaining the variance in observed agricultural
   chemical concentrations during post-planting runoff. Logistic regression
   models were somewhat more successful, correctly matching the observed
   concentration category in 61-80\% of observations. Linear and multiple
   linear regression models were moderately successful (R-2 from 0.522 to
   0.995) in explaining the variance in observed annual transport and
   annual mean concentration of agricultural chemicals. Explanatory
   variables that were commonly significant in the regression models
   include estimates of agricultural chemical use, crop acreage, soil
   characteristics, and basin topography. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The Cunha Forest Hydrological Laboratory was established in the Serra do
   Mar, Sao Paulo, Brazil to achieve some understanding of the hydrological
   processes and the effects of forest cover on these processes in the
   headwater areas. Stream-gauging from two subtropical forest catchments
   (56.0 ha and 36.7 ha) covered with the Mata Atlantica commenced in 1982.
   Measurements of crown interception, surface runoff from a hillslope and
   estimation of soil water storage within the catchments quantified
   individual components of the hydrological processes. Ten years of field
   measurements and hydrograph analysis show that about 15\% of annual
   rainfall is intercepted by the forest cover and returns directly to the
   atmosphere while 85\% of the rainfall reaches the forest Boor, where it
   infiltrates and remains in the soil to feed subsurface flow and baseflow
   or transpiration. Humid conditions obtain throughout the year and
   surface runoff is a rare occurrence on forested hillslopes. Stormflow is
   generated from wetland source areas adjacent to streams and from seepage
   from hillslopes. The total volume of stormflow is only 11\% of annual
   rainfall. Fifty-nine \% of annual rainfall is stored in the soil mantle
   and Bows via subsurface routes to streams as baseflow throughout the
   year. This sustained flow of streams is one of the most important
   hydrological features and is controlled by such basin characteristics as
   the physical properties of the soil, the depth of the soil mantle and
   the vegetative cover. Soil evaporation and transpiration were estimated
   as 15\% of annual rainfall by the water balance equation. Thus, the
   annual hydrological budget for the catchments is 70\% streamflow and
   30\% evapotranspiration. Riparian areas are also places of stormflow
   production as well as of soil water and groundwater storage of water
   derived from hillslopes as interflow. An assessment of the area, depth
   of sediment and porosity of the riparian areas helps in understanding
   the runoff processes in low-order catchments in the Serra do Mar. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper describes the hydrologic system associated with the Barton
   Springs portion of the Edwards aquifer and presents a lumped parameter
   model capable of reproducing general historical trends for measured
   water levels and spring discharge. Recharge to the aquifer was
   calculated based on flow loss studies of the creeks crossing the
   recharge zone and on estimates of the rate of diffuse infiltration of
   rainfall. Flow measurements on each creek above and below the recharge
   zone were used to develop a relationship between how above the recharge
   zone and the rate of recharge. The five-cell groundwater model, each
   cell corresponding to one of the watersheds of the five main creeks
   crossing the recharge zone, was developed to support the management
   objectives of the City of Austin. The model differs from previous models
   in that the aquifer properties within cells are allowed to vary
   vertically. Each cell was treated as a tank with an apparent area and
   the water level of a single well in each cell was used to characterize
   the conditions in that cell. The simple representation of the hydrologic
   system produced results comparable to traditional groundwater models
   with fewer data requirements and calibration parameters. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Several hydrological problems need a technique of flood routing for
   their solution. The commonly used technique of dynamic hood routing
   assumes a single rating curve as the downstream boundary condition,
   although, in general, there would be a loop rating curve even at this
   location, The effect of not accounting for the presence of the loop
   diminishes if a single rating curve is specified on an extended length
   of the channel. A criterion is presented for the selection of the
   location of a downstream control section where a unique rating curve can
   be supplied without introducing significant error in the computed
   results for the upstream sections. The proposed criterion has been
   developed on the basis of results obtained by routing hypothetical
   hydrographs through channels with and without flood plains using a
   four-point centred implicit scheme. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

   important aspect of assessing the performance and safety of radioactive
   waste disposal sires. To study gas-phase migration in this environment,
   helium gas was injected at constant pressure through an access borehole
   into an inclined fracture zone at a depth of about 40 m, in the granitic
   Lac du Bonnet Batholith, southeastern Manitoba, Canada. The gas flow
   rate, arrival time and pattern of distribution of gas at the surface
   were monitored by soil gas surveys. Gas Bow rate increased from 5 to 20
   l min(-1) over the 11-day period of the test indicating removal of water
   from the Bow paths. Breakthrough of injected gas at the surface was
   detected within 2 days. Two areas of high concentrations of gas
   discharge were observed within 40 m of the injection borehole,
   indicating gas transport through near-vertical fractures. A larger area
   of trace He concentrations was detected 200 m away indicating transport
   along the fracture zone. The field results were compared with
   predictions of a simple analytical model derived from Braester and
   Thunvik (1983). Good agreement was found when the influence of
   fracturing in the bedrock and a low-permeability overburden and `excess
   porosity' due to non-uniformity of fracture apertures were included in
   the model. The model was then used to estimate and map the relative
   hydraulic conductivities of individual gas flow paths in the fractured
   rock. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Runoff generation on a small semi-arid agricultural catchment with mixed
   land use in the Loess Plateau of China was monitored over a 19-year
   period. To investigate the possible spatial variations in runoff
   generation on the catchment, eight plots were set up on various sections
   of the hillslope and monitored for 6 years. Only a small proportion of
   rainfall events generated runoff, contrary to the assumption that
   rainstorms in this area are characterized by high intensity and short
   duration, and thereby lead to runoff generation, Runoff occurrence and
   yields were also found to be highly variable within the catchment. To
   explore further the results obtained from the field observations,
   portable and downspraying sprinklers were used in field experiments.
   Both produce similar rainfall intensities but the raindrops from the
   portable sprinkler have very low kinetic energy and do not break down
   aggregates and form crusting, while raindrops produced by the
   downspraying sprinkler have similar characteristics to natural rainfall.
   A comparison of the experimental results obtained by those two kinds of
   sprinklers dearly demonstrated that runoff generation in this area is
   largely affected by surface crusting. The effects on runoff generation
   of the crusts formed during previous storms and the present storm were
   examined experimentally. Finally, the impacts of cultivation and plowing
   on runoff generation were determined through field investigation and
   experiments. This study suggests that there is considerable potential to
   reduce runoff and erosion, and to increase soil moisture and crop yields
   on the Loess Plateau through changes of currently inappropriate land use
   and the improvement of land management. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The optimal channel network (OCN) concept provides a physical argument
   for the form of river networks based on testable hypotheses relating to
   the exponents of the downstream hydraulic geometry relationships and the
   variation of longitudinal slope along the channel. Measurements made
   over 5-day periods of steady flow in two catchments of areas 121 and 158
   km(2) are described. At each site in each basin measurements of the
   flow, channel cross-section and elevation have been made. A total of 340
   measurements were made in one basin and 308 in the other and provide one
   measurement for about every 0.5 km of channel. The data are used to test
   the OCN concept. Less extensive data from two larger catchments are also
   used to help with the evaluation. The results do not support the depth,
   velocity and slope exponent values derived in the OCN concept. Analysis
   of the cumulative distributions of the spatially distributed flows shows
   agreement at flows above 6 l s(-1) with results derived for aggregation
   systems with constant injection of mass of which the OCN concept is a
   specific example. Reasons for the differences from the OCN-derived

Abstract = {{With a numerical model, Duffy and Al-Hassan demonstrated that free
   convection of brine could occur under the playa lake in a closed basin.
   Since then, continued effort has been made to further our understanding
   of the role of free convection in closed basin hydrology. In this paper
   we present the results of 5 years of field investigation in Pilot
   Valley, Nevada, of a literature search for field studies in closed
   basins around the world, and of numerical simulations to examine the
   effect of heterogeneity on free convection and the effect of climate
   changes.
   Observations along the divide-playa transect revealed evidence of forced
   convective flow and the existence of a hinge line, The salinity profile
   and the inferred flux suggest that diffusion is the dominant solute
   transport mechanism under the field sites, but the stable isotopes (O,
   H) suggest that free convection of playa brine also occurs. We propose a
   model that explains these observations. First, free convection could
   occur farther out on the playa where the density of surface brines is
   higher. Second, once free convective flow penetrates the surface
   sediments, it could migrate laterally in the more permeable layers of
   alluvium. Third, free convection could occur during periods of time when
   brines pond on the surface for extended periods.
   The search for field studies of groundwater processes in other closed
   basins leads to a few cases where free convection has occurred on a
   basin scale. Based on this survey, we discuss the geologic and climatic
   conditions that favor free convection. Numerical simulations are carried
   out to examine the effect of basin-scale heterogeneity in hydraulic
   conductivity. The results indicate that heterogeneity changes the
   pattern of flow by creating multiple convection cells. Finally we
   address how a closed basin may respond to climate change, Climate
   changes alter the salinity of surface brines and the freshwater
   recharge, both acting as `boundary conditions' for subsurface processes.
   Using dimensional analysis and numerical simulations, we evaluate the
   effect of a warming and drying trend on free convection, and how the
   geologic features of a closed basin affect the response. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Particle-facilitated transport may be an important process in the
   leaching of contaminants such as pesticides, phosphorus and heavy
   metals. In this work particle transport in macropores through intact
   soil columns was quantified. Irrigation intensities corresponding to
   naturally occurring storm events were used. Intact soil columns (18.3 cm
   inner diameter, 20 cm length) were sampled at two different depths (2-22
   cm and 42-62 cm) from a structured sandy loam. Infiltration experiments,
   consisting of leaching of naturally occurring particles and infiltration
   with two types of colloidal suspensions were performed on each column,
   The active macroporosity was estimated in a dye experiment, A
   significant transport of particles (especially clay and silt) through
   macropores was observed at both depths. The total amount of mobilized
   particles at a certain amount of water outflow was found to be higher at
   depth 42-62 cm than at depth 2-22 cm, but unaffected by irrigation
   intensity, The particle size in the effluent was found to decrease over
   time during both the leaching of naturally occurring particles and
   during the subsequent leaching of colloids from the infiltration with
   colloidal suspensions, but seemed to stabilize at a particle size < 10
   mu m. The decreasing particle size may be explained by differences in
   both the adsorption capacity and in the exposure to hydraulic forces of
   the different particle sizes and by mechanical entrapment of large
   particles in the macropores. No significant differences were found
   between the infiltration of the two different types of colloid
   suspension, probably due to their relatively small differences in zeta
   potential and particle size, The mass recovery of the infiltrated
   colloids was found to be significantly larger at depth 42-62 cm than at
   depth 2-22 cm, probably due to the larger size of the macropores at
   depth 42-62 cm. A simple advection-reaction model, which takes two
   different particle size fractions ( < and > 10 mu m) into account, was
   found to describe the leaching of natural particles well using initial
   particle concentrations on the macropore walls and detachment
   coefficients for small and large particles as calibration parameters.

Abstract = {{Unpaved road surfaces have extremely low infiltration rates compared
   with other watershed land surfaces and, therefore, are significant
   source areas for erosion-producing Horton overland flow. The hydrologic
   role of roads is an important issue in mountainous areas of the tropics
   where erosion control efforts are predominately focused on deforestation
   and agricultural practices. We report on an investigation of soil
   physical properties that control excess rainfall (rainfall intensity in
   excess of infiltration capacity) on rural roads and surrounding lands in
   a mountainous watershed in northern Thailand. The results of our disk
   permeameter measurements indicate that saturated hydraulic conductivity
   on unpaved roads is about one order of magnitude lower than on any other
   land-surface type. Median saturated hydraulic conductivities were not
   exceeded by measured rainfall intensity on any land use except road
   surfaces and roadside margins. By simulating excess rainfall, we found
   that in contrast with other areas of the watershed, the road surface
   tends to generate excess rainfall early in a rain event, and on nearly
   all of its area. Despite the relatively small areal extent of
   road-related surfaces ( < 0.5\% of basin area), they contribute a large
   portion of basin-wide total excess rainfall during frequently occurring,
   small rainfall events. However, during larger events, agricultural,
   secondary vegetation, and forested areas assume greater importance
   because of their larger areal extent. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Surface water flow in wetlands occurs typically in a low gradient
   environment where topographic and flow resistance variations control the
   discharge distribution. it is within this fluid mechanical regime that
   the biochemical processes constituting wetland ecology take place.
   Presented herein are the basics of a mathematical model that takes
   advantage of the hydraulics typical of wetlands. The resulting model, in
   the form of a 2-D, non-linear diffusion equation, allows incorporation
   of spatial variations in Bow resistance and topography, The
   applicability of the model to one- and two-dimensional wetland type flow
   is demonstrated using two cases: a laboratory experiment and a wetland
   pond. Results illustrate the versatility of the formulation and the
   important influence of topography variations on flow depth and velocity
   variations. The use of a fixed rectangular calculation domain to
   simulate the flow pattern in wetlands with irregular wet boundaries is
   the most significant practical aspect of the WETFLOW model. Future
   research will concentrate on dealing with extreme heterogeneity in the
   elevation and Bow resistance distributions, through a combination of
   measurements and use of stochastic fractals to represent property
   distributions (Molt and Boman, 1993, Water Resour. Res., 29: 3769-3774).
   Experimental studies are needed to quantify the relationship of Bow
   resistance to different combinations of slope, water depth, and a
   suitable measure of vegetation density for a wetland ecosystem. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The related issues of water movement and contaminant transport in arid
   and semi-arid environments have generated considerable interest and
   concern in the last few decades. Essential to understanding these issues
   is knowledge of how water moves through the soils that form the
   uppermost part of the vadose zone. The use of tracers, both natural and
   artificially introduced, is proving to be an effective method for
   gaining such knowledge in dry regions, where investigation by other
   means is difficult. In this study, natural stable-isotope and chloride
   tracers were used to investigate water movement in the soils of a
   pinon-juniper woodland and of a ponderosa pine forest on the Pajarito
   Plateau in northern New Mexico. The objectives were to (1) estimate and
   compare near-surface flux rates and evaluate the importance of
   evaporation in the two communities, and (2) determine to what extent
   differences in flux rates and evaporation are due to differences in
   plant cover and/or soil hydraulic properties. The results of this study
   will aid in evaluating the potential for contaminant mobility in
   semi-arid systems such as the Pajarito Plateau and, in addition, will
   increase understanding of nutrient distributions and plant water use in
   semi-arid environments. The stable-isotope data indicate a similarity
   between the pinon-juniper and ponderosa communities with respect to
   evaporation: in both, it is restricted mainly to the upper 10 cm of
   soil. Chloride profiles from the two communities, on the other hand,
   show a distinct difference with respect to downward fluxes: in the
   ponderosa pine forest, these fluxes (approximate to 0.02 cm year(-1))
   are an order of magnitude lower than those in the pinon-juniper woodland
   (approximate to 0.2 cm year(-1)), even though total precipitation is
   about 4 cm year(-1) higher in the ponderosa pine forest. This
   difference, however, appears to be related not to plant cover, but to
   differences in soil hydraulic properties. The soils of the ponderosa
   pine forest contain clay-rich B horizons that appear to restrict
   downward movement of water through the soil matrix, whereas the soils of
   the pinon-juniper community have B horizons much lower in clay content.
   The effect of differing soil properties on water movement suggests that
   contaminant distributions will vary across the Pajarito Plateau. The
   data on soil water ages support this hypothesis: they indicate that
   water (and, thus, contaminants) moves through the soil matrix in less
   than a decade in some areas, whereas in other areas, water takes
   hundreds of years to pass through the entire soil profile. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The processes affecting salinization of precipitation, surface water,
   vadose water and groundwater were studied in the Negev desert, Israel.
   Observations spanning 18 years included the collection of rainfall at
   three rain sampling stations, flood water at six flood stations, vadose
   water from four coreholes penetrating chalk formations, and groundwater
   from 16 monitoring wells tapping the chalk aquitard, Dissolved carbonate
   dust and evaporation of the falling raindrops result in Ca(HCO3)(2)
   facies and increased ion concentration of the rainwater with respect to
   inland, more humid regions. The exposure of flood water to evaporation
   during flood events is minimal. The observed Ca(HCO3)(2) facies and salt
   enrichment by a factor of three to five in the flood water with respect
   to precipitation results primarily from interactions of the flood water
   with the chalk and limestone bedrock, including ion exchange on Na- and
   K-bearing minerals and the dissolution of calcite, gypsum and halite.
   The presence of these salts at and near land surface results from the
   complete evaporation of rainwater in land surface depression storage
   areas following most rain events, Except for a small portion moving
   through the low permeability chalk matrix, most of the vadose water
   moves through preferential pathways and is typically not exposed to
   evaporation. This dual movement of water accounts for the NaCl facies of
   vadose water and the variable rates of isotopic depletion and salt
   dilution observed in the underlying heterogeneous groundwater in the
   saturated zone. Although the variable mixing with low-salinity,
   isotopically depleted water percolating from the fractures accounts for
   the depleted isotopic composition of the groundwater, its relatively low
   solute content cannot modify the groundwater NaCl facies. Consequently,
   only groundwater salinity in the chalk is reduced by the preferentially
   flowing water, but the Ca(HCO3)(2) facies prevailing in the rainwater
   and flood water disappears, and the NaCl imprint from the vadose zone
   prevails. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The boundary-fitted coordinate (BFC) system method is applied to
   simulate steady groundwater seepage with a free-surface and seepage face
   using the finite-difference method. The BFC system method eliminates the
   difficulty of fitting finite-difference grids to a changeable
   free-surface which is not known a priori but will be obtained as part,
   of a solution, Also, grid generation with this approach is simpler than
   with the finite-element method. At each iterative sweep, the changeable
   free-surface becomes a part of the boundary-fitted grid lines, making
   boundary condition implementation easy and accurate, An example problem
   demonstrating the simulation procedure and numerical results compares
   very well with the analytical solution. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Water flux measurements in a stand of black spruce (Picea mariana) with
   a feather moss (Pleurozium schreberi) floor in the boreal forest of
   Northern Manitoba show that stemflow is volumetrically insignificant,
   constituting less than 1\% of gross precipitation amounts. Canopy
   interception is shown to be up to 60\% of gross precipitation for small
   events, and approximately 15\% for large ones. Season-long canopy
   interception was 23\% of gross precipitation, Moss interception is shown
   to be approximately 23\% of total throughfall amounts, giving a
   season-long `whole-system' interception of 41\% of gross precipitation.
   The data suggest that approximately 79\% of throughfall inputs move
   through the moss layer within a few days of input events, and that the
   approximate 21\% retained by the moss subsequently evaporate during
   quiescent periods, Throughfall inputs to the moss layer are strongly
   spatially variable, resulting in a similar variability of process in the
   moss layer. The data also suggest that processes occurring at the
   moss-mineral soil interface are influential in determining the nature of
   system hydrologic response. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The drop size distributions and the drop velocity function that
   characterize simulated rainfall at three intensities are modelled in
   terms of expressions developed for natural rainfall. As a result, the
   continuous relationship between kinetic energy per unit of mass (or
   time) and intensity is defined for the simulated case, and is compared
   with that for natural rainfall at similar intensities. The similarity
   characterizing drop size distributions of natural rainfall is found also
   in simulated rainfall. However, the drop fragmentation process in the
   simulator differs from the process that occurs in natural rainfall, and
   the dimensionless expression of the resulting drop size distributions
   differs from the theoretical function proposed by Assouline and Mualem
   (1989, Trans. ASAE, 32(4): 1216-1222). For a falling distance of 5.5 m,
   the velocity at the soil surface of the simulated drops is similar to
   the terminal velocity of natural raindrops of equivalent diameters. The
   simulated rainfall kinetic energy per unit of mass is close to the
   natural rainfall value at similar intensity, and the maximal difference
   is about 10\%. However, the differences in the respective drop size
   distributions induce different trends in the kinetic energy-intensity
   relationship. The simulated rainfall kinetic energy per unit of time is
   not a linear function of the intensity. Therefore, cumulative rainfall
   is not equivalent to cumulative kinetic energy, and cannot be used as
   the independent variable in models dealing with processes affected by
   the rainfall energy without error. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrochloric acid and calcium and sodium chloride salt solutions were
   passed through humified bog peat cores of 1 m length to determine values
   for the material properties governing solute transport: hydraulic
   conductivity, effective porosity, and dispersivity. Chloride passed
   through the bulk peat cores about twice as fast as predicted from
   chloride breakthrough curves measured by selective-ion probes inserted
   into the peat 30 cm downgradient from the source. With continued
   experimentation, chloride dispersion increased, Chloride also passed
   through the peat up to 12 times slower than predicted by conservative
   advection. The retardation of the chloride fronts, the faster bulk
   transport, and the asymmetry of the breakthrough curves all indicate
   that humified bog peat is a dual porosity medium. Solutes both move
   preferentially through active macropore spaces and diffuse into dead
   pore space in the peat matrix.
   Neither the effective porosity nor the dispersivity of the pear could be
   precisely determined from the breakthrough curves because the hydraulic
   conductivity and discharge rates through the peat increased as much as
   five times when the chloride tracer solutions passed through the cores,
   In initial experiments, the shapes of the breakthrough curves were
   generally consistent with dispersivities of the order of centimeters,
   similar to that observed for granular soils at the same length scale
   (meters), whereas they `flattened' considerably during later
   experiments, suggesting dispersivities in the range of tens of
   centimeters. We hypothesize that the interaction of the chloride tracer
   solutions with organic-acid functional groups may cause macropores to
   dilate and micropores to close off. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The mathematical catchment model TOPMODEL was used to simulate the
   hydrological behaviour of a mountain catchment at Jalovecky Creek,
   Western Tatras, Slovakia. The model provided adequate results in
   simulation of daily runoff from the catchment for the period 1 August
   1987-31 October 1993. Air temperature inversions, typical of certain
   periods in mountain catchments, caused overestimation of simulated
   runoff because of treatment of snowfall as rainfall. A single value of
   the temperature limit for solid-liquid precipitation was also not
   appropriate for some events. Similarly, the single value of the
   degree-day factor for the entire period used in the snow subroutine has
   led to higher simulated snowmelt runoff in some years. Hourly data were
   used for runoff simulation during the short period between 15 August and
   7 September 1993. The results indicate that more effort will be required
   to improve the simulation, although the total simulated runoff for the
   whole period was close to the measured runoff. The areal extent of the
   saturated area calculated by TOPMODEL for the two short-term events was
   comparable with the results based on isotopic runoff separation.
   However, saturated areas estimated by TOPMODEL may provide both event
   and pre-event water, whereas areas contributing new water estimated by
   the isotopic method provide pre-event water by definition. (C) 1997

Volume = {{195}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{1-25}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The seasonality of river flooding in North Britain displays considerable
   spatial variation. This paper identifies the geographical patterns of
   flood seasonality, using a database of events exceeding modest
   flood-flow thresholds at each of 156 gauging stations, and seeks to
   explain them in terms of climatological and catchment characteristics.
   Floods are found to occur at all times of year, but most rivers register
   at least 78\% of events in the October-March half-year, and these
   generally occur later in the year with distance from west to east.
   However, notable exceptions are superimposed upon this general pattern
   and, in particular, two areas of less pronounced seasonality occur on
   north-facing parts of the east coast, Seasonality is characterized using
   three complementary methods, including a four-fold seasonal
   classification which summarises the patterns found. In order to explain
   these patterns, reference is made to the seasonality of storm rainfall,
   soil moisture deficits, catchment size and lake storage. Seasonality
   class is correctly explained by reference to these catchment
   characteristics in 74\% of cases using discriminant analysis. The work
   is presented as an advance in the understanding of flood generation and,
   ultimately, in the assessment of flood risk.}},

Abstract = {{A framework has been developed that enables the estimation of climate
   change impacts on flow regimes of catchments in England and Wales.
   Within this framework, rainfall-runoff processes are represented by a
   unit hydrograph-based model that was calibrated against historical data
   from 39 catchments. Rainfall and temperature inputs were perturbed
   according to an equilibrium climate change scenario. Three study
   catchments, of widely differing flow regime, are presented as examples
   of the versatility of the model, and to illustrate variations in
   catchment response under the modified climate. Results, quantified by
   percentage change in low, mean and flood flows, were interpolated
   spatially to provide a regional picture of hydrological response.
   Catchments in central and eastern England suffer the most severe
   reductions in low flows whilst flooding is seen to increase in the north
   and west. The linking of model parameters to physical landscape
   characteristics allows estimation of flows, both historical and
   climate-changed, at ungauged sites. Since these characteristics include
   land use indices, it is possible to quantify second-order effects
   resulting from changes in land use.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved Rn-222 concentrations in ground water from a small wellfield
   underlain by fractured Middle Proterozoic Pikes Peak Granite southwest
   of Denver, Colorado range from 124 to 840 kBq m(-3) (3360-22700 pCi
   L-1). Numerical simulations of flow and transport between two wells show
   that differences in equivalent hydraulic aperture of transmissive
   fractures, assuming a simplified two-fracture system and the
   parallel-plate model, can account for the different Rn-222
   concentrations in each well under steady-state conditions. Transient
   flow and transport simulations show that Rn-222 concentrations along the
   fracture profile are influenced by Rn-222 concentrations in the
   adjoining fracture and depend on boundary conditions, proximity of the
   pumping well to the fracture intersection, transmissivity of the
   conductive fractures, and pumping rate, Non-homogeneous distribution
   (point sources) of Rn-222 parent radionuclides, uranium and Ra-222, can
   strongly perturb the dissolved Rn-222 concentrations in a fracture
   system. Without detailed information on the geometry and hydraulic
   properties of the connected fracture system, it may be impossible to
   distinguish the influence of factors controlling Rn-222 distribution or
   to determine location of Rn-222 point sources in the field in areas
   where ground water exhibits moderate Rn-222 concentrations.
   Flow and transport simulations of a hypothetical multifracture system
   consisting of ten connected fractures, each 10 m in length with fracture
   apertures ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mm, show that Rn-222 concentrations at
   the pumping well can vary significantly over time, Assuming
   parallel-plate Bow, transmissivities of the hypothetical system vary
   over four orders of magnitude because transmissivity varies with the
   cube of fracture aperture, The extreme hydraulic heterogeneity of the
   simple hypothetical system leads to widely ranging Rn-222 values, even
   assuming homogeneous distribution of uranium and Ra-226 along fracture
   walls, Consequently, it is concluded that Rn-222 concentrations vary,
   not only with the geometric and stress factors noted above, but also
   according to local fracture aperture distribution, local groundwater
   residence time, and flux of Rn-222 from parent radionuclides along
   fracture walls.}},

Abstract = {{The influences of the soil moisture condition on ammonification,
   nitrification and denitrification were examined by in situ experiments
   on forest floors using soil column lysimeters, Distinct differences were
   detected in the discharge concentrations of NH4+ and NO3- from
   lysimeters with different soil water content. Three types of lysimeters
   (diameter 19.5 cm, depth 30.0 cm) were prepared by containing
   undisturbed soil samples. Inorganic nitrogen discharged from lysimeters
   under natural rainfall was measured approximately once a week from 5
   July to 29 November 1991. Soil moisture conditions of the three
   lysimeters were controlled using an average pressure head at the bottom
   of each column at -268.6 hPa, 0 hPa, and 19.8 hPa, These three moisture
   conditions corresponded approximately to the conditions in the upper or
   mid-upper hillslopes with relatively dry soil, lower hillslopes with
   relatively wet soil, and riparian zones around spring points and streams
   with saturated soil, respectively. For these soil moisture conditions,
   three different types of inorganic nitrogen discharges were observed;
   (1) ammonium and nitrate nitrogen; (2) nitrate nitrogen; (3) neither
   ammonium nor nitrate nitrogen, The result clearly showed the restraint
   of nitrification by soil moisture deficit and the reduction of NO3- by
   denitrification under saturated conditions. This suggests that the
   different stages of the process in nitrogen dynamics could occur owing
   to only the influence of soil moisture variations even in the shallow
   soil layer. The nature of inorganic nitrogen discharge from each
   lysimeter helped to explain the spatial heterogeneity of the nitrogen
   dynamics caused by distributed soil moisture conditions within a
   watershed system.}},

Abstract = {{Evaporation rates responded very quickly to surface desiccation, and the
   control by surface resistance (derived from the Penman-Monteith model)
   was very pronounced. The absence of an efficient means to transfer
   subsurface moisture to the surface resulted in an evaporation regime
   which was strongly moisture-limited only a few days after precipitation.
   However, the high frequency of precipitation events in this environment
   meant that both energy-limited and moisture-limited regimes occurred in
   quick succession. The range of minimum surface resistances is similar to
   those used in current land-atmosphere climate models, but they tend to
   be considerably greater during drying events. Four different physically
   based evaporation models were compared with hourly or daily Bowen
   ratio-energy budget measurements. Best results were obtained by using an
   aerodynamic approach. If high-quality sensible heat measurements are
   available, then the evaporation rate could be readily estimated by
   treating it as a residual in the energy budget equation. The
   Priestley-Taylor method is potentially valuable, but the objective
   specification of surface moisture availability is difficult in alpine
   tundra. An alternative approach using equilibrium evaporation plus a
   surrogate measure of surface water (daily precipitation) clearly
   stratified daily actual evaporation into wet and dry regimes, and may
   have some predictive value.}},

Abstract = {{Every 7-10 days during the winter of 1989-1990, we measured
   precipitation ion input, snowpack water equivalent (SWE) and ion
   content, soil water and streamwater chemistry along a subalpine to
   alpine elevation gradient in the Fraser Experimental Forest (FEF),
   Colorado. The objective was to quantify the effect of elevation and
   aspect on snowpack ion accumulation and loss, and relate these processes
   to subsequent change in soil water and first-order stream chemistry
   during snowmelt. SWE increased with elevation (P < 0.001) and was
   greatest on NE aspects (P < 0.001), Snowpack ion concentration increased
   with elevation, with NH4+ and NO3- showing the most consistent (P <
   0.05) increase throughout winter. Snowpack base cation (C-B) and SO42-
   concentrations were significantly higher on NE aspect transects. In most
   weeks, the snowpack NH4+ and NO3- content was highest (P < 0.05) in the
   alpine zone. Peak snowpack NH4+ and NO3- content totalled more than 1 kg
   inorganic N ha(-1). Alpine soil water NO3- concentration during and
   after snowmelt was greater (P < 0.001) than at lower elevations.
   However, there was no significant correlation between weekly snowpack
   ion loss and soil water chemistry. At the FEF, it seems that most
   snowmelt is routed through the watershed as subsurface flow. Soil
   processes such as ion exchange, biological uptake, overwinter
   nitrification and mineralization are probably major factors modifying
   melt water chemistry. There was no correlation between soil water
   chemistry and streamwater chemistry, which probably reflected the high
   variation in distance and time required for soil water to reach the
   stream.}},

Abstract = {{A large-scale hydrological model study is carried out to investigate the
   geohydrological responses to glacial climate conditions in Northwest
   Europe. The vertically integrated groundwater model is based on a
   supraregional hydrogeological model of the Cenozoic and Mesozoic
   subsurface in Northwest Europe. Three different layers are distinguished
   above the relatively impervious base of Palaeozoic and Precambrian
   rocks,
   Boundary conditions are inferred from indicative palaeoenvironmental
   reconstructions of the last three glacial cycles to simulate groundwater
   flow related to ice sheet expansions into the Northwest European
   lowlands. Recharge of the groundwater system due to basal glacial
   melting is deduced from ice sheet model simulations driven by a
   transient climate function. Results of the large-scale model study show
   relatively high groundwater velocities and pressures in the subglacial
   areas and the ice-marginal permafrost areas. Extreme high velocities may
   develop when the ice sheet has advanced to the southern margins of the
   upper Plio/Pleistocene aquifer in Northwest Europe. Drainage of the
   highly pressurized groundwater system mainly occurs in proglacial
   ice-dammed lakes, ice-marginal seas and zones of discontinuous
   permafrost, including river valleys.}},

Abstract = {{The paper focuses on the ties of kriging with a deterministic
   interpolation procedure, known as multiquadratic surface fitting. The
   two methods are compared, first from a theoretical point of view, then
   using a practical example. It is shown that kriging equations with a
   linear variogram model are identical in form to equations of
   multiquadratic surface fitting with cone surfaces. The issue of the
   accuracy of both estimators is discussed through a case study where
   hourly rainfall maps of real storm events collected by radar provided
   the reference rainfall. Random point sampling of the accumulation
   pattern simulated gauge returns. Eight sampling densities were used and
   for each density rainfall spatial distributions were estimated for a
   large number of realisations. It is shown that kriging performs better
   at lower gauge density, while at higher gauge density the accuracy of
   both estimators is similar.}},

Abstract = {{Soil water retention curves are often used to estimate the hydraulic
   conductivity function. Unfortunately, single S-shaped functions cannot
   adequately describe water retention curves of structured soil,
   especially near saturation. The approach of superposition of two or more
   unimodal retention functions such as the van Genuchten model was used
   here to describe retention data of a macroporous soil. A total of 180
   cores, 0.05 m diameter and 0.051 m long, were sampled along a 31-m-long
   transect in three overlying soil horizons. Use of unimodal retention
   curves leads to an underestimation of observed water contents both near
   saturation and in the midpore range, while an overestimation is found in
   the drier range. Superposition of two unimodal retention curves
   significantly improved the estimation over the entire pressure range.
   However, the predictions were still not ideal near saturation, With
   three unimodal curves, a perfect fit was obtained from saturation to
   residual water content, Most of the multimodal parameter values were
   moderately heterogeneous along the transect, with the surface horizon
   slightly more heterogeneous than the deeper layers. The coefficient of
   variation (CV) for multimodal parameters was generally in the range of
   20 to 70\%. Use of the multimodal van Genuchten model with the
   conductivity estimation model of Mualem resulted in conductivities that
   were generally much smaller than those estimated by the classical
   unimodal van Genuchten-Mualem model. A preliminary evaluation of the
   estimated bimodal and trimodal unsaturated hydraulic conductivity model
   was based on a comparison with independent conductivity measurements
   using a combination of crust test, hot-air method, and an unsteady
   drainage flux experiment on large columns. The crust and hot-air data
   compared best with the estimated trimodal conductivity function. The
   unsteady drainage data did not match well with the crust and hot-air
   data and could not be described with any of the estimated conductivity
   functions.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial step size for the second-order accurate Muskingum-Cunge
   (M-C) method is determined by the spatial weighting factor. Both the
   spatial weighting factor and the time step must be selected judiciously
   to obtain accurate solutions. In this study, accuracy criteria for the
   linearised diffusion routing problem are discussed. Starting from the
   truncation error analysis of the general finite-difference scheme used
   to solve the kinematic wave equation (of which the M-C method is a
   special case), conditions necessary to obtain second-, third- and
   fourth-order accurate solutions to the linearised diffusion routing
   equation are derived. For given diffusion coefficient and celerity, the
   spatial step of the fourth-order scheme is fixed, whereas third- and
   second-order solutions are available for independently selected spatial
   steps. In order to achieve optimal solutions to the second-order
   accurate scheme, the truncation error criteria are combined with a
   condition derived from the concept of column holdup. This combination is
   shown to produce results as good as those from the third-and
   fourth-order accurate schemes. The simplest explicit method is shown to
   give satisfactory results for flood data from the River Wye (UK).}},

Abstract = {{The role of fire in the hydrological behaviour of gorse shrub is studied
   from the point of view of its effects on vegetation cover and
   throughfall. In the first year after fire, throughfall represents about
   88\% of gross rainfall, whereas in unburnt areas it is 58\%. Four years
   after fire, the throughfall coefficients are similar in burnt and
   unburnt plots (about 60\%), The throughfall is not linearly related to
   vegetation cover because an increase in cover does not involve a
   proportional reduction in throughfall. The throughfall predicted by the
   two-parameter exponential model of Calder (1986, J. Hydrol., 88:
   201-211) provides a good fit with the observed throughfall and the gamma
   value of the model reflects the evolution of throughfall rate. The soil
   moisture distribution is modified by fire owing to the increase of
   evaporation in the surface soil and the decrease of transpiration from
   deep soil layers. Nevertheless, the use of the old root system by
   sprouting vegetation leads to a soil water profile in which 20 months
   after the fire the soil water is similar in burnt and unburnt areas.
   Overall, soil moisture is higher in burnt plots than in unburnt plots,
   Surface runoff increases after a fire but does not entirely account for
   the increase in throughfall. Therefore the removal of vegetation cover
   in gorse scrub by fire mainly affects the subsurface water flows.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical simulation model entitled UCGVDSM is proposed for modelling
   coupled transport of mass and energy into the snowpack. The model is
   tested on point snowmelt data for station Kuhtai located in the Austrian
   Alps. Model performance is assessed on the basis of model reproduction
   of three state variables-snow water equivalent, melt water flux and
   depth of snowpack. The model also provides information on internal
   processes of the snowpack. The range of all the parameters used in the
   model is extensively examined through a sensitivity analysis. The search
   for optimum values of the parameters is combined with sensitivity
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{A continuing problem in hydrology is the estimation of peak discharges
   for design purposes on catchments with only limited available data. A
   promising and elegant approach to this problem is the derived hood
   frequency curve pioneered by Eagleson (1972, Water Resour. Res., 8(4):
   878-898). A number of studies using this approach have been published
   over the last 20 years but only a few have compared the predicted curves
   with observations. One exception used a simple stochastic rainfall model
   to drive a version of TOPMODEL (Beven, 1987, Earth Surf. Processes
   Landforms, 12: 69-82). The present study describes a new version of the
   stochastic rainfall simulator previously used with TOPMODEL and its
   application on three small catchments (1.87, 4.75 and 25.81 km(2)) in
   the Jizera Mountains in the Czech Republic. The rainfall model
   differentiates between high and low intensity events. The resulting
   rainfall statistics were checked by comparisons with measured data. The
   flood frequency curves predicted by the combined model were constrained
   by the regional estimates or a measured series for short return periods
   and used to predict longer return period flood magnitudes. Only one
   TOPMODEL parameter has to be adjusted-an effective average
   transmissivity. For the two smaller catchments also a rainfall parameter
   has to be adjusted depending on the size of the catchment, It is shown
   that the random sequence of rainstorms can have a significant effect on
   the predicted 100 year return period event, even for 1000 year
   simulations and without allowing for uncertainty in the rainfall model
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Sealing, crusting and cracking of crusts of the soil surface has been
   observed in many parts of the world in areas with sandy, silty and loamy
   soils. Sealing and crust formation occurs under the influence of rain
   storm and drying weather, With prolonged drying, surface crusts might
   crack, leading to complex situations with respect to infiltration and
   runoff generation. Cracking of crusted loamy soils appears to be a
   general process. This study aims to measure the hydraulic properties of
   fully crusted and cracked-crusted areas and to evaluate the effects of
   these measurements on catchment discharge and soil loss in a loess
   region of the Netherlands, using the LISEM soil erosion model. Samples
   with minimum infiltration rates (fully crusted) and with maximum
   infiltration rates (cracked-crusted surfaces) were taken from fields
   with bare soil or winter wheat and their soil hydraulic functions were
   measured, The results of these measurements were used as input in the
   LISEM soil erosion model, Simulations of discharge and soil loss were
   done for each of these two land-uses and for two rain events,
   Additionally, simulated discharge and soil loss under actual recorded
   land-use were calculated. In all cases, soils with no surface cracks
   produced higher figures for discharge and soil loss than those where
   10\% of the surface crust was cracked, For a good interpretation of the
   results for soil loss, the spatial distribution of cracked-crusted areas
   and fully crusted areas has to be investigated in detail. To deal with
   cracked-crusted and fully crusted areas in simulation modelling, care
   has to be taken to accurately measure the soil physical functions
   representing the maximum and minimum infiltration rates. An assignment
   of these functions to calculation grids has to be made. As the LISEM
   model is capable of assigning different soil physical functions to each
   calculation grid, an improved prediction of the soil physical behaviour
   of the catchment can be simulated.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1984, stream chemistry and macroinvertebrate assemblages have been
   monitored in 17 headwater streams which drain the Cairngorm region of
   Scotland. Three streams were considered to be acidified (mean pH < 6.0
   and mean acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) < 25 mu eq l(-1)), 10 were
   acid-sensitive (pH < 6.8 and ANC < 150 mu eq l(-1)) and a further four
   were well-buffered (pH > 6.8, ANC > 150 mu eq l(-1)). The acidified
   streams had impoverished macroinvertebrate faunas. All of the streams
   have exhibited a decline in non-marine sulphate concentrations over the
   last decade in response to reduced sulphur deposition. In the more
   acidic and acid-sensitive systems this has generally been matched by a
   corresponding increase in ANC, There is also evidence of an increase in
   the pH of the most acidic streams, though no increased diversity or
   abundance of acid mayfly macroinvertebrate taxa species have been
   observed. Further reductions in deposition and longer time for a
   reversal of soil acidification appear to be necessary before greater
   biotic recovery can occur.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of data from high spatial resolution satellite-mounted
   infrared sensors has the potential to monitor the water stored by small
   dams in semi-arid areas. A simple method of analysis is described and
   particular attention is given to selecting an appropriate threshold
   level to discriminate water from non-water land cover. The use of a
   Geographic Information System (GIS) allows further discrimination of the
   areas of water from other areas, such as deep shadow, which have been
   classified incorrectly and facilitates the automatic calculation of dam
   capacities. The success of the technique is demonstrated on data from
   two regions in Botswana.}},

Abstract = {{Two soil columns (Davos sand, Alptal loam) were subjected to a cycle of
   one-dimensional freezing and thawing from both ends towards the middle
   of the columns. The freezing characteristic curves were determined at
   different levels in the columns and used to estimate parameters in a
   physically based mathematical model. Measurements of liquid soil water
   content with time domain reflectometry (TDR) were influenced by
   calibration restrictions related to the experimental setup. A model
   developed by Van Loon et al. (1991, Transp. Porous Media, 6: 391-406)
   was used to calculate the salt concentration in the liquid water phase
   from TDR measurements of the soil electrical conductivity. Measured bulk
   salt concentrations (salt content per volume soil) were found to be very
   sensitive to the liquid water contents, especially at low values,
   Results indicate a freezing-induced redistribution of the salt in the
   column: first, there was a convective flow of salt towards the cold
   ends; second, diffusion occurred in the opposite direction owing to
   developing concentration gradients. Conceptually, the setup presented
   can be applied to field conditions to detect in situ redistribution of
   salt induced by soil frost.}},

Abstract = {{Transient groundwater flow between a reservoir and a semi-infinite
   unconfined aquifer has been one of the fundamental research topics in
   hydrogeology. Prediction of water level changes in the aquifer, due to
   water level variations in the reservoir, is of importance in
   contamination control, irrigation and hydrology. The movement of
   groundwater under this condition is described by the nonlinear
   Boussinesq equation. Analytical solutions to this equation are limited
   to some special cases and often require tedious computations. In this
   study, a new solution technique is developed in which the Boltzmann
   transformation is used to reduce the Boussinesq equation to a nonlinear
   ordinary differential equation, and the water level distributions are
   calculated using the Newton-Raphson method. The solution procedure
   requires very little computational effort, and the solution has been
   verified by comparing with analytical and numerical solutions. This
   solution should have application in verifying other analytical or
   numerical solutions, and in many practical hydrogeological problems. Two
   linearized solutions are evaluated using the new analytical solution
   developed in this study. The linearized solution with respect to h(2)
   gives a better result than that linearized with respect to h.}},

Abstract = {{The non-linear partial differential equation describing the transient
   radial flow of air towards an extraction well has attracted extensive
   attention. Several linearized analytical solutions have been derived by
   adapting analytical solutions for groundwater flow. However, the
   validity of these linearized solutions remains unjustified because the
   exact non-linear solution for transient radial air flow to a well has
   not been available, In this study, an exact analytical solution is
   obtained using the Boltzmann transformation, and the pressure is
   calculated using the Newton-Raphson method. The solution provides a
   means for evaluating linearized analytical solutions and verifying
   numerical models. Examples are presented to test linearized analytical
   solutions for air flow towards an extraction well. Tests indicate that
   errors in pressure calculation using linearized analytical solutions are
   relatively small when the governing equation and boundary conditions are
   linearized with respect to pressure-squared. However, the errors owing
   to linearization are unacceptably large when the governing equation and
   boundary conditions are linearized with respect to pressure.
   Linearization with respect to pressure-squared is therefore recommended
   in adapting groundwater flow solutions. The new technique developed in
   this paper results in a solution that is simple to implement and
   requires very little computational effort. The technique can be applied
   to solve many other nonlinear diffusion problems.}},

Abstract = {{The link between space and time scales in hydrological modelling, in
   most cases, is related to both the model structure and the
   implementation procedure, and this makes the hydrological predictions
   differ from one model to another. A monthly water balance (MWB) model
   and the snow accumulation-ablation (SAA) and soil moisture accounting
   (SMA) models of the US National Weather Service (US NWS) were examined
   and compared on a medium-sized mountainous catchment (the Mesochora
   catchment in Central Greece) under historical climate conditions. The
   analysis focused on the model time resolution, structure, input data,
   and calibration process. The best results were obtained from the US NWS
   models, which ran on smaller time increments (6 h step for the SAA model
   and daily step for the SMA model), were explicitly parameterized, and
   for which the input data and parameter estimate procedures were more
   accurate. The main model evaluation criteria were the NTD efficiency
   measure for the 15 year study period and the comparison of the measured
   and predicted streamflow by the average month. The hydrological results
   for both models (SAA-SMA and MWB) showed small differences in the
   monthly runoff values and a greater interannual variability for the
   SAA-SMA models. The monthly soil moisture predictions by the models were
   different. The hydrological simulation under global climate change
   conditions is presented in the companion paper.}},

Abstract = {{The variability in monthly and seasonal runoff and soil moisture has
   been analysed with respect to global climate change. The seasonal runoff
   and soil moisture for the Mesochora catchment in Central Greece were
   simulated using two hydrological models that were different in structure
   and time resolution. Variability was investigated via a monthly water
   balance (MWB) model which has a first-order memory and includes a rough
   estimation of snowmelt component, and via the coupling of the snow
   accumulation-ablation (SAA) conceptual model and the soil moisture
   accounting (SMA) conceptual model of the US National Weather Service (US
   NWS). The last two models operated at a 6 h and daily time step,
   respectively. The SMA model predicted greater interannual variability of
   runoff changes than did the MWB model, for all alternative climates.
   However, greater runoff increases in winter (by month and season) and
   greater decreases in summer (by month and season) were predicted by the
   MWB model. During the spring and autumn months the results were much
   more complicated. The variability of runoff changes with respect to
   temperature increase showed that the MWB model is less sensitive to
   large temperature increase than the SAA-SMA models for all precipitation
   climates. Whereas the SMA model soil moisture varied substantially for
   the alternative climates and a particular month (and season), the MWB
   model soil moisture remained unaffected by any climate during winter.
   The soil moisture reduction predicted from the MWB model was greater
   than that predicted from the SMA model in late spring and summer. There
   was a slight reduction in the SMA model soil moisture with respect to
   temperature increase in winter, for all precipitation climates. During
   winter and August the MWB model soil moisture remained unaffected by any
   temperature increase, whereas during the other months the soil moisture
   reduction varied proportionally with respect to temperature increase for
   both models (SMA and MWB) and all precipitation climates.}},

Abstract = {{A statistical approach based on a multivariate correlation Of various
   hydrochemical parameters has been developed for the interpretation of
   groundwater how lines of the Vasilikon basin in the southern part of the
   central area of Euboea island in Greece. Water samples, mainly from
   wells but also from boreholes, were collected and analysed for 44
   hydrochemical parameters, from which the conductivity, dissolved O-2,
   Ca, Mg, chloride, acid-consuming capacity, base-consuming capacity, Si,
   Fe and As were selected for the evaluation. After normalization of each
   parameter by z-transformation - to equalize the influence of parameters
   with small and large variations - a classification of the sampling
   stations was obtained by cluster analysis. By the use of the same
   z-transformed data the degree of similarity of element-concentration
   (z-transformed) profiles between the central sampling points and the
   surrounding sampling points was investigated. The resulting radially
   distributed correlation vectors were reduced to the main axis of an
   ellipse, so that flow lines or trend of groundwater movements became
   visible. The results of this method were also compared with
   hydrogeological observations of the Vasilikon basin.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional integrated well-face Aux (IWFF) model is developed for
   computing the drawdown at the well-face and around a fully or partially
   penetrating well with wellbore storage, situated in a layered confined
   aquifer. In this model, we calculate drawdown and well-face flux
   distributions by numerically solving a two-dimensional diffusion
   equation in cylindrical coordinates subject to appropriate initial and
   boundary conditions and to the well-face boundary constraint of an
   integrated well-face flux rather than the physically inconsistent
   uniform well-face flux boundary condition (the UWFF model). The
   differences between the IWFF and UWFF models in a partially penetrating
   well situated in a homogeneous isotropic aquifer are insignificant for
   wellbore drawdown (less than 3\%) but are pronounced for the well-face
   flux. In fact, the latter strongly deviates from uniformity as the ratio
   of the screen length to the aquifer thickness decreases. For partially
   penetrating wells situated in multilayer aquifers, significant
   differences between the two models may arise, especially if the screen
   is not located in the most conductive layer. These differences depend on
   the hydraulic conductivity contrast of the adjacent layers.
   Consequently, the uniform well-face flux boundary condition should be
   used with extreme caution.}},

Abstract = {{When an annual maximum flow series is displayed in a probability plot,
   the data often exhibit two or more distinct segments. For estimating
   floods of large return periods, it is probably more appropriate that any
   interpolation and extrapolation are made by exploring the trend shown by
   the larger flows in the sample series. Lower bound censored samples may
   be used to fit distribution functions, but the analytical techniques
   available for doing so are either inadequate or complicated. In this
   paper, the use of higher probability weighted moments (PWMs) for
   distribution fitting is proposed. Higher PWMs give more weight to larger
   flows. By matching higher PWMs to their sample estimates, the resulting
   distribution fits more closely to the larger flows in the sample.
   Examples using actual data and Monte Carlo simulation results show that
   there is considerable merit in using the method for predicting large
   return period events. The method involves no more complication than the
   well-accepted method of using the lowest orders of PWMs.}},

Abstract = {{The use of simple geostatistical tools is often constrained by data
   trend (nonstationarity) to characterize the spatial variability of soil
   properties in the subsurface environment influenced by any site-specific
   feature(s). Adaptive approaches, such as site-specific robust-resistant
   schemes, median polishing, trend analysis, etc., are thus used to
   preprocess the spatial data before analyzing for their spatial
   structures. Soil water nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration (mg l(-1))
   and soil moisture content (cm) data collected jointly from 175 sites
   arranged on a 5 x 7 x 5 three-dimensional (3-D) grid network of 7.6 m x
   7.6 m x 0.3 m spacings in a tile-drained agricultural plot were analyzed
   for their three-dimensional spatial distribution and for possible
   coregionalization. We propose a physical process-based correction scheme
   to preprocess the nonstationary spatial data of soil NO3-N concentration
   and soil moisture content. Using the subsurface-drain flow phenomenon,
   we developed a relative-Darcy-flux-based correction scheme to remove any
   tile drainage-induced nonstationarity in the spatial data of soil NO3-N
   concentration and soil moisture content prior to conducting the spatial
   analysis in the 3-D soil volume. 3-D composite semivariograms of
   relative-flux-corrected NO3-N concentration and relative-flux-corrected
   moisture content showed anisotropic linear structures in three principal
   directions. Linear models characterized by steep slopes were found in
   the directions perpendicular to tile line as opposed to nugget models
   found in the direction parallel to the tile line. Good spatial
   correlation between the relative-flux-corrected NO3-N concentration and
   relative-flux-corrected soil moisture content and their anisotropic
   linear semivariograms produced anisotropic linear cross semivariograms
   in 3-D. The 3-D composite cross semivariogram will be useful in
   predicting the more expensive variable, (relative-flux-corrected) soil
   water NO3-N concentration, at unsampled locations in the soil profile
   with a cheaper surrogate, the measured (relative-flux-corrected) soil
   moisture content. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in the density of aqueous phase fluids flowing in a porous
   medium, resulting from spatial and temporal variations in the solute
   concentration, often gives rise to unstable flow and mixing. Numerical
   studies on unstable behavior of dense aqueous phase contaminant plumes
   in three-dimensional porous media are rare in the literature. In this
   study, a three-dimensional numerical model was used to simulate
   gravitational instabilities in dense aqueous phase plumes. Our simulated
   results showed that physically realistic instabilities in dense plumes
   can be generated by small random perturbations, including
   truncation/round-off errors. Although the numerical simulations were
   able to qualitatively reproduce the experimental results, they
   quantitatively underestimated unstable behavior of dense plumes. For a
   given size of the contaminant source, the width of the porous medium had
   a significant effect on the occurrence and development of gravitational
   instabilities. Dense plumes are more unstable in the transverse than in
   the longitudinal direction of the flow domain.}},

Abstract = {{A comparison of different tracer tests, conducted in mining waste rock
   from the Aitik site in northern Sweden, is made by use of temporal
   moment analysis and advection-dispersion modelling of experimental
   breakthrough curves. The tracer tests were carried out in both
   laboratory columns and held lysimeters, and the experimental conditions
   included both saturated and unsaturated flow, ranging from being close
   to steady-state to being highly transient. The objectives were to
   investigate the possible occurrence of preferential flow and the
   transport behaviour of two tracers, bromide and uranine, under
   geochemical conditions prevailing in mining waste rock. No indications
   of significant preferential flow were found in the laboratory columns.
   In the field, there were indications of water flowing preferentially in
   about 55-70\% of the total water content. In relatively old waste rock,
   the tracers bromide and uranine behave differently, with uranine being
   both retained and delayed relative to bromide. These effects on uranine
   are most probably due to low pH conditions in parts of, or along the
   entire length of the tracer pathway in the mining waste rock, suggesting
   that uranine may be useful as an indicator of limited acidic zones
   within a larger transport domain; in mining waste rock, acidic zones are
   associated with higher pollutant generation. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Pages = {{201-220}},

Abstract = {{This study aims at establishing an understanding of the influence of the
   (fracture-wellbore) system intersection angle on various predictions
   made through single-well tests and developing mathematical models which
   can reproduce the responses of acute systems to various forms of
   disturbances under different conditions. The differential equation
   governing flow in conceptualized acute systems is derived from basic
   principles. Analytical solutions to this equation are reached for both
   transient and steady constant-flux test conditions. The potential theory
   is utilized to delineate the flow network and the zone of influence in
   acute systems during tests under initially non-uniform head conditions.
   The likelihood of non-linear how regime and its influence on the
   observed head changes and hence the aperture (or permeability)
   predictions are addressed and a general formulation is introduced. An
   overall discussion for the proposed models also addresses the natural
   extension of the basic concepts to refine estimates of other well test
   models.
   Major observations of practical significance include: (a) permeability
   of a hydraulically effective fracture is misjudged whenever an acute
   system is reduced to an orthogonal or a Vertical system configuration
   and (b) efficiency of production wells is largely affected from the
   angle of intersection, the fracture(s) dominating flow forms with the
   wellbore. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Microdepression-focused recharge in a coastal wetland, La Plata,
   Argentina}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{194}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{221-238}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Depression-focused recharge (DFR) has been well documented for the
   clay-till plains of western Canada, kettle lakes of southeastern
   Wisconsin, the Sandhills region of Nebraska, and elsewhere. In this
   study the importance of DFR in a fine-grained estuarine coastal plain
   environment with extremely low topographic relief is shown.
   The southwestern coastal plain of the Rio de La Plata near the city of
   La Plata, Argentina, extends 8-9 km inland from the river, and ranges in
   elevation from 0 to +3 m above sea level. The Holocene Postpampeano
   sediments, predominantly composed of silty clay in the study area,
   mantle the coastal plain and exert a major control on the hydrodynamics
   of groundwater of the region. The average hydraulic conductivity of the
   unit ranges from 1.0 x 10(-9) m s(-1) when estimated on a small scale
   (single-well and oedometer tests) to approximately 1.0 x 10(-8) m s(-1)
   when estimated on a larger scale (tritium profiles and seepage meters).
   A study of the groundwater flow system has established that recharge is
   occurring in the marshes of the central coastal plain, which are 0.5-1.0
   m lower than the surrounding land. A broad, 50-cm-high groundwater mound
   (a significant feature in the context of a regional hydraulic gradient
   of 0.0005) was documented below the marshland using nests of monitoring
   wells. Recharge rates are further controlled by subtle, 10-40-cm
   elevation Variations within the marsh, Four nests of six monitoring
   wells each were installed in the marsh and sampled for tritium.
   Recharge rates were then estimated through calibration simulations using
   a 1-D analytical solute transport model. In the two nests in the lower,
   wetter areas, recharge rates were estimated at 4-6 cm year(-1), whereas
   estimated recharge rates in the higher, drier areas ranged from 0-3 cm
   year(-1). These differences are consistent with: (1) near-neutral
   vertical hydraulic gradients in higher areas vs persistent downward
   gradients in lower areas, (2) chloride concentrations almost an order of
   magnitude lower in groundwater underlying lower areas than in that of
   higher areas due to flushing of older, more saline groundwater in the
   lower areas, and (3) isotopic evidence for evapotranspiration only in
   the higher areas.
   The present study suggests that pending of surface water in local
   depressions can lead to significant recharge from coastal wetlands. This
   finding has implications for the study of water balance, soil salinity,
   and nutrient budgets in these environments. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Recession analysis and low how frequency analysis have been treated by
   tradition as separate problems, although both are related to low flow
   conditions. The shape and analytical expression of the streamflow decay
   during rainless periods might give an insight into the behaviour of the
   tails of low flow distribution functions. Furthermore, models for
   streamflow recession have, as a rule, a more or less straightforward
   physical background and this might be of help in the interpretation and
   regionalization of parameters of low flow distribution functions. The
   present paper is an attempt to combine results from these two separate
   fields in order to use recession equations to derive theoretical
   expressions for low flow distribution functions. The derived
   distribution approach together with the concept of compound
   distributions are used to deduce expressions for a family of low flow
   distributions related to linear and non-linear recession models.
   Approaches for parameter estimation are elaborated and exemplified on
   low flow data from the Nordic countries. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Saline groundwater and irrigation drainage are commonly diverted and
   stored in both natural and artificial depressions throughout the
   Murray-Darling Basin of Australia. The disposal basin brines that are
   formed are often denser than ambient groundwater, Under certain
   conditions these dense brines may become unstable causing them to mix
   with groundwater over distances several orders of magnitude greater than
   due to diffusion alone. A model is developed to study the mixed
   convection processes below a saline disposal basin located between a
   recharge and discharge zone. Numerical simulations are performed in
   cross-section using the 2-D density dependent model SUTRA
   (saturated-unsaturated transport). It is shown that the salt front
   movement is related to both the ability of the dense saline brines to
   mix convectively with underlying groundwaters (Rayleigh convection) and
   the strength of the regional advective velocity. Both homogeneous and
   heterogeneous aquifer systems are studied and the effects of anisotropy
   are considered. Our numerical results suggest that the behaviour of a
   dense brine plume overlying less dense groundwater in a homogeneous
   porous medium depends on the magnitude of at least two non-dimensional
   numbers, a Rayleigh number and modified Peclet number, defined in terms
   of basin scale hydrogeologic parameters including dispersion, It is
   shown that the onset of gravitational instabilities and the formation of
   free convective cells begins when the magnitude of a non-dimensional
   parameter combining the Rayleigh and modified Peclet number exceeds a
   certain critical value. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A small (<15 km(2)), low temperature (<20 degrees C), CO2 gas
   overpressured, gently dipping Paleozoic carbonate aquifer rests on
   Precambrian granite in a narrow canyon along the eastern edge of the
   Rocky Mountain Front Range, Colorado. The carbonate aquifer is bounded
   on three sides by granite and in the down dip direction by the Front
   Range fault. The fault, in a major continental intraplate zone of
   weakness along which magmatic fluids and gases could migrate to the
   surface and near surface from great depths. The fault has also
   overthrusted slices of carbonate and elastic rocks several kilometres
   below the granitic basement.
   Stable isotopic (delta(2)H and delta(18)O) and discharge temperature
   data suggests that carbonate aquifer ground waters are of meteoric
   origin and have not circulated to depths greater than the base of the
   carbonate aquifer (approximate to 650 m). Elevated CO2 and the
   delta(13)C Of HCO3- in the carbonate aquifer suggest an external crustal
   source of CO2 gas. He-3/He-4, O-2/N-2 and Ar/N-2 gas ratios indicate gas
   contributions from both magmatic and atmospheric sources. Atmosphere
   contributions account for about 25\% of the exsolving gas, whereas
   magmatic CO2 accounts for 7 to 14\%. Possible external CO2 sources,
   which are consistent with the mean HCO3- delta(13)C = -2.4 parts per
   thousand (PDB), are clay-carbonate mineral diagenesis or low temperature
   metamorphism of siliceous-carbonate rocks that have been overthrust by 3
   to 6 km of granite. Diagenetic or metamorphic CO2, mixed with some
   magmatic gas, appears to have migrated from the source rock area upward
   along the Ute Pass thrust fault until it encountered the shallow
   carbonate aquifer ground water system where it was further diluted with
   atmospheric gas. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrochemical budgets of major inorganic ions in three grassland and
   two forest catchments (ranging from 72 to 376 ha) in the uplands of
   Wales have been measured over a 2 year period. The catchment outputs of
   major ions have been compared with the total atmospheric inputs, the
   latter comprising dry deposition of NO2, SO2 and NH3, cloud droplet
   (occult) deposition of SO42-, NO3-, Cl-, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and NH4+, and
   wet deposition of the same ions. The enhancement in wet deposition by
   orographic effects was modelled to provide wet deposition.
   The catchment output over 2 years is in good agreement with atmospheric
   inputs for the marine ions Cl- (+/-5\%) and, to a lesser extent, Na+
   (+/-10\%). For sulphur, good agreement between inputs and outputs is
   also generally obtained (+/-10\%), demonstrating the need to quantify
   all of the major atmospheric deposition pathways. The majority of the
   sulphur (approximately 70\%) is wet deposited, and these studies provide
   strong support for the procedures to modify orographic enhancement of
   wet deposition in the UK uplands. The cloud droplet deposition pathway
   is generally a minor component of the budget but may approach 25\% for
   afforested catchments. Dry deposition of SO2 and NO2 is a relatively
   small component (20-30\%) of the S and N budgets, whereas dry deposition
   of NH3 is a major input (approximately 50\%), although current estimates
   of annual NH3 inputs are subject to large uncertainties.
   If chloride is assumed to behave as a conservative ion in the
   catchments, then the mass Aux estimates show that the annual base cation
   weathering within catchments unaffected by bedrock mineralisation and
   agricultural liming may be estimated directly from the mass budget, and
   should range from 1-11 kg ha(-1) year(-1) (Ca2+) and from 2-6 kg ha(-1)
   year(-1) (Mg2+).}},

Abstract = {{Soil vapor extraction (SVE) is a standard remediation technique for
   removing volatile organic compounds from contaminated soils. An
   important aspect in planning of SVE systems is the estimation of the
   time frame in which remediation can be achieved. In this study,
   analytical solutions are developed which can be used on the one hand for
   estimation of the required cleanup time and on the other hand for
   gaining insight into the processes which take place during the soil
   remediation. The analytical solutions are based on the well-mixed
   reservoir model as well as on the pure advective gas transport model,
   and their reliability is assessed by comparing their results with those
   of numerical simulations. Concerning mass transfer between the water
   phase and the solid phase, equilibrium well as rate-limited sorption are
   considered. For the case of rate-limited sorption two extraction
   strategies (continuous extraction and pulsed extraction) are
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the Hershfield factor (H); H is the ratio between
   a quantile of an A-maximum and an F-maximum, where an A-maximum is a
   maximum over a time interval of prescribed length with Arbitrary
   starting point, and an F-maximum is its analogue with fixed starting
   point (e.g. 0800 local time).
   The author (1990) assumed the same type of distribution for the F- and
   A-maximum without any relation between the F- and A-parameters. Here
   sensible restrictions on these parameters are proposed, and the
   resulting more tractable estimation procedure for H on merely F-data is
   presented.
   Attention is paid to factors associated with the variability of H by
   analyzing monthly maxima of daily precipitation amounts in a Chinese
   data set with 130 stations over 30 years. The factor H turns out to be
   associated with location, autocorrelation and fraction of wet days. (C)

Abstract = {{Due to various types of uncertainties involved in the estimation of a
   unit hydrograph (UH), the UH derived by any method is subject to
   uncertainties. Based on the concept of the bootstrap resampling
   technique, a practical methodology called storm resampling is proposed
   to quantify the uncertainties of multiple-storm UH ordinates and any
   parameters involved in the estimation of the multiple-storm UH. The
   important UH ordinates and parameters may include UH peak discharge, UH
   time-to-peak, UH volume, condition number related to the effective
   rainfall matrix, mean square error of the UH, and ridge parameter. The
   proposed bootstrap-based storm resampling technique, along with the
   least squares and ridge least squares solution techniques, is applied to
   typhoon storm events over a watershed in Taiwan. The methodology can be
   applied to other UH solution techniques and other hydrological and

Abstract = {{This paper addresses rainfall radar measurement in mountainous areas
   where numerous catchments subject to flash flooding are located. The
   main sources of error affecting the quantitative use of weather radar
   data are examined with special attention paid to the influence of
   topography and altitude. A radar in a mountainous region is affected by
   specific measurement errors such as beam blockage; other sources of
   error like bright band interception can be enhanced by the effect of
   altitude, This work is based on data collected during the 86-88 Cevennes
   Experiment conducted in a mountainous Mediterranean region in the south
   of France prone to Bash floods, Analysis of the main sources of error
   leads to the following observations. Beam blockage can be corrected
   using digital terrain models with the correction efficiency depending on
   the accuracy of the radar antenna pointing direction. The influence of
   vertical variations in radar reflectivity is shown to be taken into
   account at an hourly time step in order to provide satisfactory
   range-dependent corrections. Additionally, the control of the stability
   of the radar signal using strong ground clutter is described. Because of
   attenuation effects, the use of a 10-cm wavelength is recommended for
   surveying intense rain events which regularly affect Mediterranean
   regions, The error due to an unadapted Z-R relationship is shown to
   depend on the statistical distribution of reflectivity over the
   catchment where the rainfall measurement is utilized. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the validation of radar rainfall measurement in
   a mountainous region by comparison with raingage data, Initially, the
   comparison serves as a basis for defining the assessment factor
   introduced to correct the systematic bias often affecting radar data.
   Several methods are available for determining the assessment factor and
   all are shown to provide a similar result. Corrections for both beam
   blockage and vertical profile of reflectivity are also evaluated. Both
   corrections provide an improvement in radar measurement accuracy. The
   validation of radar rainfall measurement is performed at the catchment
   scale of a few hundred square kilometres and at an hourly time period,
   these conditions being consistent with hydrological needs. The reference
   rainfall is determined by interpolating data from a dense raingage
   network. The accuracy of the areal reference value is defined by its
   standard deviation. A validation criterion taking into account the
   accuracy of the reference value is introduced. Validation results show a
   good level of agreement between reference measurements and radar data at
   the catchment scale. The confidence associated with the reference value
   suggests a combined use of radar and raingages based on the control of
   radar estimates by raingage measurements. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Design flows from infiltrating micro-catchments are investigated using a
   kinematic model of overland flow and a physics-based representation of
   the infiltration process. Critical storm duration is shown to be
   governed by two relationships, one equivalent to the traditional
   approach of setting concentration time equal to rainfall duration and
   the other yielding a potentially critical duration independent of plane
   length. In case of two competing results, the valid one is recognized as
   giving the shorter of the two durations calculated. Derivation of the
   governing equations has been carried out preserving as much generality
   as possible. In addition to the equations mentioned, a `'rainfall
   window'' describing all overland flow producing storms in accordance
   with a given intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationship is
   identified and mathematical expressions for its evaluation are given.
   Practical application is demonstrated by a number of sample
   computations. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Volume = {{193}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{61-82}},

Abstract = {{Riverine fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate
   organic carbon (POC) were estimated at 23 sites on two major river
   systems in NE Scotland, from fortnightly measurements of concentration
   and flow. The annual flux of DOC and POC increased cumulatively
   downstream in both the R. Dee and the R. Don. At the lowest, non-tidal
   site the estimated annual DOC export (95\% confidence limits) was 4.1
   (+/-2.1) x 10(6) kg per year for the R. Dee and 2.3 (+/-1.3) x 10(6) kg
   per year for the R. Don. POC exports in the two rivers comprised about
   10\% of the total organic carbon flux in the R. Dee at 0.3 (+/-0.2) x
   10(6) kg per year and 25\% in the R. Don at 0.7 (+/-0.5) x 10(6) kg per
   year. When expressed on a unit area basis, DOC flux estimates were
   approximately 20 kg ha(-1) per year and POC exports were approximately
   1-5 kg ha(-1) per year at main stem sites on both rivers, However, there
   were considerable variations in fluxes between tributary and headwater
   sites on the R. Dee. DOC exports ranged from 13.2 to 115.0 kg ha(-1) per
   year and POC exports were between 6.0 and 85.3 kg ha(-1) per year. In a
   sample of 11 R. Dee sub-catchments, annual fluxes of DOC and POC both
   showed a strong positive correlation with the cover of hill peat in the
   catchment area, which indicates that areas of hill peat are a major
   source of organic carbon to the river. In the lower parts of the R. Dee
   and R. Don catchments, POC export rates during non-storm how conditions
   also appeared to be related to the extent of arable land in the
   catchment. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrological balance and nutrient inputs in water were measured in a
   lower montane rain forest (1200 m) in Panama. Rainfall and throughfall
   were measured daily between July 1988 and July 1989 using a standard
   rain gauge and 50 longitudinal PVC collectors, respectively. Stemflow
   was measured daily between November 1990 and December 1991 in nine trees
   varying from 16 to 54 cm diameter at breast height (dbh), using tygon
   collars. Rainfall and throughfall water samples were collected every 15
   days between January and October 1989 for chemical analyses (pH,
   conductivity, NO3-, NO2-, NH4+, PO43-, SO42-, Ca2+, Cl-, Mg2+, K+, Mn,
   Fe and Si). Bulk precipitation was 3510 mm. Interception was 37.2\%, net
   precipitation was 62.8\%, of which, throughfall was 62.4\% and stemflow
   was 0.4\%. The probability distribution of throughfall as a proportion
   of bulk precipitation, showed that 82\% of the total variability is
   lower than a bulk precipitation value of 1.0 and that there are higher
   values in this mountain forest than in a lowland rain forest in Brazil
   were this value was also calculated, suggesting that the canopy of this
   montane forest is more heterogeneous, In only 6 of 140 of the rain
   events, was net precipitation higher than bulk precipitation, suggesting
   that direct inputs of cloud water by fog interception, is not an
   important water source for this forest. Interception at Fortuna is the
   highest value yet reported for a tropical montane rain forest; it maybe
   attributed to a very tall canopy (20-30 m) and abundant epiphyte load.
   Nutrient inputs in water varied from 0.70 kg ha(-1) per year of PO4-P to
   34.5 kg ha(-1) per year of Cl. Leaching varied from 1.45 kg ha(-1) per
   year for PO4-P to 49.71 kg ha(-1) per year of K. Net absorption by the
   canopy was measured for S (-7.0 kg ha(-1) per year SO4-S) while for N
   the total annual input was about the same as the annual throughfall.
   Annual fluxes of calcium, sodium and potassium in bulk precipitation in
   the Fortuna forest were in the upper range of values reported for other
   tropical montane sites, perhaps owing to the proximity to the Caribbean
   Sea, Nutrient inputs of N, P and K in throughfall are consistent with
   inputs of throughfall relative to other nutrient pathways in tropical
   and temperate forests. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Forest floor evaporation was measured with an accurate weighing
   lysimeter during 44 days in early spring and summer. The Penman-Monteith
   approach was used to model the evaporation rates as well as the
   temperature difference between forest floor surface and air at Im
   height. Values of resistance parameters were slightly different when the
   Penman-Monteith model was optimized for measured evaporation rates or
   for measured temperature differences. These discrepancies were partly
   due to field variability in forest floor water contents but also because
   our approach considered the forest floor to be isothermal. With the
   appropriate parameter sets, the model was able to predict measured
   hourly forest floor evaporation rates and surface temperature dynamics
   satisfactorily.
   We show that in the forest discussed in this paper the Penman-Monteith
   ventilation term dominates over the available energy term. As a result
   the evaporation flux is matched by an almost equal, sensible heat flux
   but in opposite direction. Forest floor water content dynamics have a
   strong control over the evaporation flux. Spatial variability in forest
   floor water contents cause the 44-day average forest floor evaporation
   to range from 0.19 mm d(-1) in a dry part of the forest to 0.3 mm d(-1)
   in a wet part with 0.23 mm d(-1) as a site representative value. (C)

Abstract = {{As part of the framework of the EFEDA (Echieval field experiment in a
   desertification threatened areal experiment, an 11-day data set
   including atmospheric Forcing, turbulent fluxes and soil water
   monitoring was gathered on a bare soil site, characterized by a large
   diurnal cycle of temperature, and with very dry conditions near the
   surface, A version of the SiSPAT (Simple Soil Plant Atmospheric
   Transfer) model, restricted to bare soil, was applied to this data set.
   The first objective was to validate model results against observations.
   This was restricted somewhat by the narrow range of soil moisture
   variations during the 11 days of the simulation. In addition some
   discrepancies were observed between total evaporation as calculated from
   neutron probe measurements and micrometeorological ones. However,
   because the SiSPAT results were more in agreement with evaporation
   calculated from soil water balance, it was assumed that the model could
   be used as a tool to investigate the mechanisms of the water movement
   and evaporation within the soil under such dry conditions. In the first
   25 cm of soil, vapour flux is the most important transfer term, and the
   evaporation front (change of phase from liquid to vapour) can be
   localized at this depth. The contribution of temperature gradients to
   mass Bur is also found to be important, and tends to lower the total
   evaporation at the surface by creating a downward vapour flux component
   which partly cancels the upward one induced by large matric potential
   gradients at the soil surface. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Evaporation rates were measured for an oligotrophic raised peat bog
   dominated by the restionaceous rush Empodisma minus (Hook. f.) Johnson
   and Cutler in northern New Zealand.
   Evaporation rates were smaller than those found for other wetlands,
   ranging between 0.06-0.16 mm h(-1) during the daytime, and the average
   latent heat Aux accounted for only 23\% of net radiation. Daily average
   evaporation was only 34\% of the Penman potential open water rate, yet
   the soil was permanently close to saturation.
   Bowen ratios in the range 3-5 indicate that available energy is
   primarily partitioned into sensible heat by the dense plant canopy.
   Bowen ratios in this range are normally associated with semi-arid zone
   climates rather than with a permanently moist raised peat bog.
   According to the Penman-Monteith model, the conservative evaporation
   regime at this site is due to a very large canopy resistance, with daily
   averages in the range 150-608 s m(-1) when the canopy is dry, This large
   canopy resistance is probably the result of plant responses to a
   nutrient-poor environment, combined with the effect of an extremely
   dense canopy preventing the diffusion of water vapour from the moist
   peat substrate.
   Variations in canopy resistance behaviour are caused by variable degrees
   of canopy wetness for several days following rain, This behaviour poses
   difficulties for modelling evaporation in water balance studies, hence a
   simple scheme utilising the Penman potential open water evaporation is
   favoured. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The groundwaters of major karst springs and several piezometers and
   wells in the Damascus limestone aquifer systems (Syria) have been
   investigated using chemical and environmental isotope techniques. The
   groundwater bodies of major karat springs mainly originate from direct
   infiltration of atmospheric water. The groundwaters emerging from the
   Figeh main spring have lower stable isotope concentrations than those
   emerging from the Barada spring. Stable isotopes show that the elevation
   of the recharge zones of the Figeh main spring (1750 m above sea level)
   is higher than those for the Figeh side spring (1500 m) and the Harouch
   spring (1300 m). The groundwater in the Barada spring seems to be
   recharged in a catchment area with a mean elevation of about 1250 m. The
   temporal evolution of stable isotope concentrations, tritium content and
   hydrochemistry show the existence of an interconnection between the
   aquifers of the Figeh main spring and the Figeh side spring, especially
   during flood periods. The distinct independent isotopic composition of
   Harouch spring from those of Figeh main and side springs suggests no
   interconnection with the Figeh aquifers. Adopting a model with
   exponential time distribution, the mean turnover time (residence time)
   of groundwater in Figeh main spring was evaluated to be 50 years. On the
   basis of this evaluation, a value of about 3.9 billion m(3) was obtained
   for the maximum groundwater reservoir size. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

   tested using measured runoff from a 9.6-ha spatially variable grassland
   catchment in the semi-arid tropics in Central Queensland. A description
   of the development of the modified ANSWERS model and testing with runoff
   from relatively uniform, cultivated catchments is given in earlier
   papers in this series. Important infiltration parameter values were
   derived from 1-m(2) rainfall simulator plots. Functions describing
   change in soil infiltration capacity with increasing pasture cover were
   included in ANSWERS. Other parameter values describing infiltration,
   catchment topography and surface conditions were measured directly,
   estimated from tabulated sources or modelled with the Grasp model.
   Runoff at the catchment outlet was well predicted for cover conditions
   that varied from bare to heavy cover. Runoff from subcatchments with
   varying areas, soil types and infiltration capacities was also well
   predicted. Runoff from high intensity rainfall events was more
   accurately predicted than from low intensity events. Using the
   application and parameterisation methods described in this paper, the
   modified ANSWERS model could be used to predict runoff from spatially
   complex catchments without optimisation of parameter values against

Abstract = {{Drainage direction assignment over Bat surfaces in raster Digital
   Elevation Models (DEM) has been a stubborn problem for DEM processing
   methods. A new approach that improves upon current methods of Bat
   surface treatment is presented, The approach is based on the recognition
   that in natural landscapes drainage is generally away from higher and
   towards lower terrain, To produce such a drainage, DEM elevations of a
   flat surface are modified to impose two gradients: one away from higher
   terrain, and one towards lower terrain. Subsequent processing of the DEM
   produces a drainage pattern over the flat surface that is
   topographically consistent and exhibits Row convergence properties, The
   proposed approach is not restricted by the shape of the flat surface,
   the number of outlets on its edge, or the complexity of the surrounding
   topography. A comparison with the drainage pattern of an established
   method that displays the `parallel flow' problem shows significant
   improvements in producing realistic drainage patterns. The proposed
   approach extends automated DEM processing to digital landscapes for
   which existing methods cannot provide adequate flow directions over flat
   surfaces to conduct a drainage analysis. The necessary algorithmic
   details for implementation of the approach are provided. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The mean annual input, including both surface flow and rainfall, into
   the Okavango Delta(Botswana) is about 16 billion m(3). Between 96 and
   98\% of this returns to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration, only 2\%
   leaving the delta by surface outflow through the Thamalakane and Boteti
   Rivers. It remains unclear how much is infiltrating into the groundwater
   below the delta.
   A severe problem is the extreme variability of the outflow. which is of
   great importance for the water supply of Maun and downstream areas along
   the Boteti where groundwater is scarce and usually saline. Previous
   modelling of the surface outflow, using over twenty years of rainfall,
   evapotranspiration and stream flow data, has revealed fluctuations in
   outflow which could not be explained with one single parameter set.
   Attempts were made to interpret this behaviour in terms of flow system
   changes occurring within the delta, or simply as an effect caused by the
   poor quality of rainfall measurements.
   This paper shows that substantial model improvement is possible when
   both long and short term antecedent climatic conditions are taken into
   account, The time span of the long term conditions, which is in the
   order of 10 years, seems to be expressed by shallow groundwater level
   variations in the lower delta, while the short term conditions, with a
   memory of one year or less, are linked to a combination of peak rain and
   flood events. The modelling therefore suggests that the outflow
   variations observed during the period of record are neither caused by
   physical changes in the delta nor result as an artefact of errors in the
   rainfall data, They are indicated to be entirely the result of climatic
   variations. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The relationships between forest stand structure, growth and evaporation
   were analysed to determine whether forest evaporation can be estimated
   from stand growth data. This approach permits rapid assessment of the
   potential impacts of afforestation on the water regime. The basis for
   this approach is (a) that growth rates are determined by water
   availability and limited by the maximum water extraction potential, and
   (b) that stand evaporation is proportional to biomass and biomass
   increment. The relationships between stand growth and evaporation were
   modelled for a set of catchment experiments where estimates of both
   growth and evaporation were available. The predicted mean evaporation,
   over periods of several years, was generally within 10\% of the measured
   mean annual evaporation (rainfall minus streamflow) when the model from
   one catchment was applied to other catchments planted with the same
   species. The residual evaporation, after fitting the models, was
   correlated with rainfall: above-average rainfall resulted in
   above-average evaporation. This relationship could be used to derive
   estimates for dry and wet years. Analyses using the models provide
   additional evidence that Eucalyptus grandis may be depleting groundwater
   reserves in catchments where its roots can reach the water table. The
   models are designed to be integrated into a plantation management system
   which uses a geographic information system for spatial analysis and
   modelling. The use of readily available growth parameters as predictor
   variables may reduce our dependence on intricate process-based models.
   This is seen as an efficient way of extrapolating existing catchment
   data - reflecting the impacts of forestry on water supplies across a
   range of sites, climatic zones and species. This approach has the
   potential for further development, especially in dealing with low flows
   and faster growing species. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Geochemical analyses of bottom sediment from rivers flowing through
   Orissa State, India indicated that trace element concentrations were
   extremely variable, and commonly higher than crustal abundance. The
   highest elemental concentrations were associated with the Brahmani
   River, followed by the Baitarani and Mahanadi Rivers. Although ail three
   rivers drain similar geology, the Brahmani River catchment is heavily
   industrialized, and sediment collected downstream from industry confirms
   that anthropogenic activity influenced its chemical composition. A
   similar pattern was observed in sediments collected downstream from
   towns in the Mahanadi and Baitarani catchments. Ln both examples, the
   clay size fraction was shown to be the most highly reactive component of
   the sediments. Comparisons between metal concentrations from the upper
   to lower stretches of the three river systems indicated no net
   accumulation downstream. Apparently, trace elements discharged into the
   river system tend to be short-lived in the water column, rapidly
   settling out or becoming adsorbed into the bottom sediment. Although for
   much of the year, the trace metals may remain locally incorporated as
   bottom sediment, during monsoonal episodes, where bedload transport can
   be significant, the effects of pollution may expand over regional
   distances. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The often observed processes involved in preferential water flow and
   chemical transport in porous media appear to be realistically described
   using a dual-continuum (dual-porosity) approach. In this approach, the
   porous medium is conceptualized as two coexistent continua, one
   representing the bulk matrix and the other the macropore region. Fluid
   and solute mass transfer between the two regions in the conceptual model
   occurs under pressure and concentration gradients. However, oscillatory
   behavior (overshoot problems in the macropore region) of the transport
   equation was observed fur high values of the advective solute flux
   relative to the diffusive solute flux between the two regions, To
   circumvent this oscillatory behavior, the fluid coupling term in the
   transport equations was treated as an element-averaged, rather than a
   nodal property. The model was extended to two space dimensions for
   evaluating the impact of agricultural practices on solute leaching, A
   linear kinetic sorption module in the transport equations and a simple
   plant root extraction routine in the flow equations were also added.
   Although the simulation results show promise, additional work will be
   needed to determine realistic model parameter values.}},

Abstract = {{The fallow vegetation of the slash and burn agriculture in eastern
   Amazonia is dominated by shrubs and trees. This study of evaporation
   from such secondary vegetation started when the aboveground parts of the
   vegetation were approximately 2.5 years old. The results are based
   mainly on a data set containing 231 days of micrometeorological
   observations in the period from April 1992 to April 1993. Evaporation
   values obtained with the Penman open water formula ranged from 1.1 to
   7.2 mm d(-1), with an overall mean of 4.6 mm d(-1). Actual evaporation,
   calculated with the Bowen ratio approach, varied from 1.2 to 5.9 mm
   d(-1), with an overall mean of 3.9 mm d(-1). Due to the high net
   radiation and vapour pressure deficit, and the evenly distributed
   moderate rainfall, the actual evaporation was constantly high during the
   transition between the rainy and dry seasons. In a relatively dry
   period, water limitations were indicated by a decrease in the actual
   evaporation compared with the Penman open water evaporation, Day-to-day
   variability was pronounced in the rainy season. An overall average of
   79\% of the net radiation was converted to latent heat flux. The annual
   evaporation was calculated by an interpolation of missing data with the
   continuously observed net radiation. The total actual evaporation was
   estimated to be 1364 mm a(-1), against rainfall of 1819 mm a(-1); the
   remaining 455 mm were allocated to drainage. When actual evaporation
   exceeded rainfall during the dry season, there had to be access to water
   storage down to depths of more than 3 m. We conclude that the young
   secondary vegetation can re-evaporate an important part of the rainfall
   input in spire of the marked seasonal distribution of rainfall. Possible
   regional climatic changes due to deforestation may be less severe in
   areas where woody secondary vegetation plays an important role in land
   cover. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Title = {{Numerical simulation as a tool for checking the interpretation of karst

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{306-315}},

Abstract = {{A schematic representation of karst aquifers may be that of a high
   hydraulic conductivity channel network with kilometre-wide intervals,
   surrounded by a low hydraulic conductivity fractured limestone volume
   and connected to a local discharge area, the karst spring, The behaviour
   of the karst spring (hydrographs, chemical or isotopic composition,
   etc.) represents the global response of the karst aquifer to input
   events.
   The available data an karst aquifer hydraulic parameters are limited,
   Global response is therefore more easily obtained and is commonly used
   to make inferences on the recharge and groundwater How processes, as
   well as on the hydraulic parameter fields. Direct verification of these
   interpretations is, obviously, very difficult.
   We have used an indirect method of verification, consisting of
   introducing well-defined theoretical karst structures into a finite
   element model and then analysing the simulated global response according
   to presently accepted interpretation schemes. As we know what we put
   into the numerical model, the validity of any interpretation may be
   checked.
   The first results indicate that some of the generally accepted
   interpretations are not necessarily true. In particular: (i) separation
   of simulated recession hydrographs into several components shows that
   different exponential components do not necessarily correspond to
   aquifer volumes with different hydraulic conductivities: (ii)
   non-exponential parts of recession hydrographs do not always give
   information about the infiltration process: and (iii) the recession
   coefficient of the baseflow (i.e. the last, nearly exponential part of
   the recession hydrograph) depends on the global configuration of the
   whole karst aquifer, not just on the hydraulic properties of the low
   hydraulic conductivity volumes. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Title = {{Impact assessment of climate change on the hydrological response of a
   snow and glacier melt runoff dominated Himalayan river}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{193}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{316-350}},

Abstract = {{The effect of climate change on snow water equivalent, snowmelt runoff,
   glacier melt runoff and total streamflow and their distribution is
   examined for the Spiti river. This is a high altitude Himalayan river
   located in the western Himalayan region. The total streamflow of this
   fiver has a significant contribution from snow and glacier melt runoff.
   Plausible hypothetical scenarios of temperature and precipitation
   changes based on the simulation of climate change over the Indian
   subcontinent by the Hamburg climate model are adopted in the present
   study. The UBC watershed model was used to simulate the hydrological
   response of the basin under changed climatic scenarios. The adopted
   changes in temperature and precipitation covered a range from 1 to 3
   degrees C and from -10 to +10\%, respectively.
   Snow water equivalent reduces with an increase in air temperature.
   However, no significant change is found in the snow water equivalent of
   the Spiti basin by the projected increase in air temperature (T + 1 to T
   + 3 degrees C). An increase of 2 degrees C in air temperature reduced
   annual snow water equivalent in the range of 1 to 7\%. Changes in
   precipitation caused proportional changes in snow water equivalent, It
   is found that annual snowmelt runoff, glacier melt runoff and total
   streamflow increase linearly with changes in temperature (1-3 degrees
   C), but the most prominent effect of increase in temperature has been
   noticed on glacier melt runoff for this high attitude basin. For
   example, an increase of 2 degrees C in air temperature has enhanced
   annual snowmelt runoff, glacier melt runoff and total streamflow in the
   range of 4-18\%, 33-38\% and 6-12\% respectively. The effect of change
   in precipitation (P-10 to P+10\%) suggests a linear increase in snowmelt
   runoff and total streamflow, while, in general, glacier melt runoff is
   inversely related to changes in precipitation. Snowmelt runoff is found
   more sensitive than glacier melt runoff to changes in precipitation
   (P-10 to P+10\%). Under a warmer climate scenario, snowmelt runoff and
   glacier melt runoff cause an earlier response of total streamflow and a
   change in flow distribution. The seasonal analysis of total streamflow
   indicates that an increase in air temperature produces an increase in
   the pre-monsoon season followed by an increase in the monsoon season.
   implications of such seasonal changes are also briefly discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{The natural isotope Br-79 in the bromide form was used as a hydrological
   tracer of groundwater movement. Laboratory-scale infiltration
   experiments using cylinders cored from granite and repacked columns of
   crushed granite showed that the change of the natural isotopic ratio
   Br-79/Br-81 with time can be used to monitor the tracer breakthrough.
   Comparison was made with other non-sorbing tracers, such as tritiated
   water, chloride and iodide. The difference in travel time of halides was
   suggested to be related to the solute size. A Br-79(-) migration
   experiment in crystalline rock was carried out between two boreholes
   connected by a low-permeability fracture. This showed the suitability of
   Br-79(-) as a groundwater tracer also for field tests.}},

Abstract = {{Hill cloud microphysics was examined with a forward scattering
   spectrometer probe over tall tussock grassland at Swampy Summit near
   Dunedin, New Zealand. In a 4-month period, cloud water drop diameter
   spectra were obtained for 17 cloud-ground intersection events that
   varied from 1 to 61 h in duration, Rain fell in most events, Easterly
   conditions made up 60\% of the events and had a median cloud drop
   diameter of 13.9 mu m and 0.14 g m(-3) liquid water content, For
   southwest winds, median drop diameter and liquid water content were
   significantly smaller at 9.8 mu m and 0.05 g m(-3).
   Aerodynamic conductance for momentum transfer, measured with a
   three-dimensional sonic anemometer, varied linearly with wind speed (R-2
   = 0.7) between 50 and 70 mm s(-1) for wind speeds from 4 to 9 m s(-1).
   Combining this relation with the cloud liquid water content
   measurements, cloud water deposition rates were estimated onto the
   0.8-m-tall tussock canopy of one-sided leaf area index = 3. These
   estimates were in the range 0.02-0.26 mm h(-1) with a median of 0.05 mm
   h(-1) which is the same as the median rate derived from the water
   balance of a large weighing lysimeter containing eight tussock plants.
   However, the water balance included a number of small quantities with
   determination of evaporation and rainfall being particularly difficult.
   Consequently, the lowest cloud water deposition rates for the water
   balance were sometimes negative, Nevertheless, even the maximum
   estimated rates incorporated into an annual calculation suggest cloud
   water deposition is unlikely to be a significant component of the water
   balance of a tall tussock grassland catchment. In the uplands of
   southern New Zealand, changing land use from tall tussock to pastoral
   agriculture with short vegetation is unlikely to alter streamflows via
   the cloud water deposition process.}},

Abstract = {{The derivation of a generalized, non-linear, diffusion wave equation,
   which explicitly includes inertial effects, is presented. The
   generalized equation is an approximation to the Saint-Venant equations
   of order epsilon, where epsilon is a characteristic ratio of the water
   surface slope to the bed slope. The derivations are carried out using a
   general expression for how resistance, representing both friction and
   form drag. Some simplified forms of the generalized diffusion wave
   equation, useful for different practical applications, are given, A
   numerical finite difference model, solving a particular simplified form
   of the generalized equation, is used to simulate a number of observed
   floods in a natural river reach, The model is then used to investigate
   the effects of non-linearity on the characteristics of flood wave

Abstract = {{Snow cover, depth and water equivalent have been measured in each snow
   season between 1989/90 and 1993/94 in the Allt a'Mharcaidh catchment in
   the western Cairngorms. Spatial and temporal patterns of snow
   accumulation vary: the peak measured water equivalent held in the
   catchment snowpack ranged from around 50 mm in mild winters to 200 mm in
   more severe ones. Snow accumulation was concentrated on north and east
   facing slopes in the parts of the catchment above 700 m. Point
   measurements of water equivalent in the areas of greatest accumulation
   exceeded 2000 mm as a result high densities produced by prolonged melt
   metamorphosis. Patterns of accumulation and melt strongly influenced the
   hydrology and hydrochemistry of the stream which has a distinct
   alpine-like regime. Low baseflows of high pH (>6.5) characterise cold
   periods of snow accumulation. Melt events are variable; slight increases
   in temperatures commonly melt all snow lying at low altitudes. More
   substantial melts involving the extensive snowpack at higher altitudes
   occur in the early spring as temperatures increase more significantly.
   Melt events strongly influence the hydrochemistry of the stream;
   preferential elution of Cl and SO4 were distinct characteristics of each
   melt season. Moreover, the most acidic (pH < 5.5) streamflows, and the
   highest levels of inorganic aluminium, were usually observed during
   snowmelt. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

   were sampled weekly during the entire sampling period. Pesticides were
   most often detected in samples collected from Orestimba Creek. This
   suggests that the western valley was the principal source of pesticides
   to the San Joaquin River during the irrigation season. Irrigation
   drainage water was the source of pesticides to Orestimba Creek.
   Pesticide concentrations of Orestimba Creek showed greater temporal
   variability when sampled three times per week than when sampled once a
   week, due to variations in field management and irrigation. The
   implication for the San Joaquin River basin (an irrigation-dominated
   agricultural setting) is that frequent sampling of tributary sites is
   necessary to describe the variability in pesticides transported to the
   San Joaquin River. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of understanding the process of solute transport in soils
   is well documented in several fields of study, including water supply,
   environmental protection and agriculture. However, researchers still
   disagree on some topics, especially the nature of the unsaturated
   dispersion coefficient. Miscible displacement experiments, carried out
   using glass beads as the porous medium show that while the saturated
   dispersion coefficient increases linearly with pore water velocity,
   under unsaturated conditions, the dispersion coefficient increases
   linearly but more rapidly with pore water velocity up to a limiting
   moisture content. Beyond this moisture content, the unsaturated
   dispersion coefficient decreases and approaches that of the saturated
   condition. These phenomena are discussed in relation to variation in
   pore water velocity and the mixing length of flow paths inside the
   porous medium. Mixing length in this sense is characteristic of the
   porous medium within which the concentration of the solution conforms to
   the surrounding concentration. The dispersion coefficient is expressed
   as the product of mixing length and standard deviation of the pore water
   velocity which is estimated from the psi-theta and K-theta
   relationships. The mixing lengths are found to be almost constant (about
   0.23 cm) in the lower moisture content range (0.16-0.27 cm(3) cm(-3)),
   but decrease at moisture contents greater than 0.27 cm(3) cm(-3). Mixing
   lengths are also smaller in saturated than in unsaturated conditions.
   Despite the apparent increase in pore water velocity and its variance at
   higher moisture content, the decrease in the dispersion coefficient can
   be attributed to a decrease in the mixing length.
   This study shows that the dispersion phenomenon, both in saturated and
   unsaturated conditions, can be described successfully using mixing
   length theory. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This paper advocates an approach to extend single-output Box-Jenkins
   transfer/noise models for several groundwater head series to a
   multiple-output transfer/noise model, The approach links several
   groundwater head series and enables a spatial interpolation in terms of
   time series analysis. Our multiple-output transfer/noise model relates
   the single-output transfer/noise models from individual series by taking
   the spatial correlation of the white noise process into account and
   spatially interpolating the parameters of the transfer and noise models.
   The parameters of the time series models and the white noise process are
   considered to be spatial stochastic fields, and are described
   geostatistically. The model parameters and the noise variance are
   interpolated by means of Kriging, The approach's applicability is
   illustrated by two cases: a point study (an observation well with
   measured data from seven observation screens) and an area study that
   requires spatial interpolation, These show the method's usefulness for
   examining the effectiveness of monitoring strategies, filling in missing
   data and for the quality control of measured data, It also enables the
   responses of the single-output transfer/noise models to be spatially
   interpolated. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Three medium sized, dry catchments located in Africa and USA were
   modeled with four or five conceptual rainfall-runoff (CRR) models of
   different complexity. The models were the Pitman model of South Africa
   (16 parameters), the Sacramento model of USA (21 parameters), the NAM
   model of Europe (15 parameters), the Xinanjiang model of China (15
   parameters), and the SMAR model of Ireland (nine parameters). Between
   these models, the Xinanjiang model has been consistently doing better
   mainly because it is the only model that considers the non-uniform
   distribution of runoff producing areas to simulate the runoff. On the
   whole, it seems that standard, good quality hydrologic data can still
   support modeling of dry catchments with traditional CRR models. The
   model performance depends more on the model structure, the objective
   function used in automatic calibration, and data quality, than on model
   complexity or calibration data length. For relatively dry catchments
   such as the great Usuthu catchment, wet years should be preferred over
   dry years for the calibration data. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A relatively simple conceptual model for infiltration during complex

   suitable for hydrologic applications. The model relies on a single
   ordinary differential equation through which successive cycles of
   infiltration-redistribution can be described. The wetting profile,
   theta(z), is described by a single similarity curve which is stretched
   in both z and a dimensions in accordance with the curve area, I,
   representing infiltrated water. The actual profile of soil water content
   after rewetting may be compound, composed two parts, each part
   represented by a similarity profile shape which evolves in time. The
   model is calibrated using a silty loam soil and is then tested on a
   variety of soils, from fine-textured to sandy loam soil types, by
   comparison with a numerical solution of the Richards equation. Like the
   earlier formulation, the model simulates infiltration rate particularly

Abstract = {{Tropical rainfall is mostly of convective origin. The associated small
   time step rainfields are consequently characterised by a strong spatial
   variability which makes especially difficult their interpolation by
   classical 2D algorithms. In the Sahel, mesoscale convective systems
   moving westward are the dominant source of rainfall. Their movement is
   relatively stable, which implies some predictability of the rainfall
   ahead of the moving storm. It is proposed here to take this feature into
   account in the interpolation of small time step rainfields, when only a
   raingauge network is available, A lagrangian approach, based on the
   interpolation of the arrival times of rainfall at points of observation,
   is developed to build 2D lagrangian rainfields. These rainfields are
   interpolated using classical 2D algorithms, such as kriging or moving
   averaging, The performance of the lagrangian estimates are compared to
   those of eulerian estimates for three Sahelian squall lines, The
   relative root mean squared interpolation error of the lagrangian
   estimates is 20 to 40\% lower than that of the eulerian estimates. The
   superiority of the lagrangian approach is especially noteworthy for the
   convective rainfields making up the front of the squall lines, The
   differences between lagrangian kriging and eulerian kriging is far more
   important than the differences between lagrangian kriging and lagrangian
   moving averages, This means that the time axis is the main axis of
   anisotropy for the 3D space-time rainfields, and that for such rainfall
   systems estimation algorithms should be refined to account for the time
   covariance rather than for the space covariance. A simulation performed
   on an idealised model of squall line (constant speed and time invariant
   hyetogram) shows that the observed Sahelian squall lines behave like the
   combination of an ideal squall line, moving undistorted at constant
   speed, and of a white noise whose level ranges from 40 to 100\%. (C)

Abstract = {{In the Netherlands shallow groundwater tables prevail in many parts,
   such that groundwater and surface water are closely interlinked. Thus
   the use of a combined groundwater and surface water model is necessary
   to predict the effect of certain measures on a regional scale. Therefore
   the model MOGROW was developed to simulate the flow of water in the
   saturated zone, the unsaturated zone and the surface water. The model is
   physically based and therefore suitable to be used in situations with
   changing hydrological conditions. The model has been kept fairly simple
   to handle practical applications.
   The saturated part consists of a quasi three-dimensional finite element
   model. The unsaturated zone is modelled one-dimensionally per type of
   land use. The following special phenomena were included in the
   unsaturated zone model: surface runoff, perched water tables, hysteresis
   and preferential flow. Some empirical parameters were introduced to
   simulate these processes. The major water courses in the model are
   considered as a network of sections. This network can also include
   special sections such as weirs, pumps, gates and culverts. The minor
   channels are considered as aggregated reservoirs connected to the
   network.
   The MOGROW model was verified on the Hupselse Beek drainage basin, an
   area of 6.5 km(2) with less pervious Tertiary deposits near the soil
   surface. It is relatively simple to simulate the variation in
   groundwater levels, but it is more difficult to correctly simulate peak
   discharges for such a basin. Incorporating the process of preferential
   flow and surface runoff in the model of the unsaturated zone gave more
   realistic discharge patterns. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Title = {{Downwind evolution of surface fluxes over a vegetated surface during
   local advection of heat and saturation deficit}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{192}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{189-210}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The horizontal advection of warm, dry air to a vegetated surface and the
   resulting effects on evaporation were examined. Contrary to the
   decreasing trend of evaporation with downwind distance predicted by
   traditional models, the eddy covariance measurements made in this study
   indicated that evaporation remained nearly constant with downwind
   distance over the few hundred meters considered. Under stronger
   advection there was even some evidence of increases in evaporation with
   distance.
   Canopy conductance values calculated from the measured values of
   sensible and latent heat fluxes, wind speed and canopy temperature,
   suggested that canopy conductance increased with downwind distance,
   likely in response to the reduction in saturation deficit. The stomatal
   response to increases in humidity may have compensated for the effects
   of the humidity on transpiration, allowing the evaporation flux to
   continue at a high rate. These results support similar assertions made
   by recent studies.
   The mechanisms of heat and water vapor transfer between the surface and
   the atmosphere, downwind of the transition were analyzed using spectral
   analyses. Power spectra of temperature and humidity scalars showed
   changes with downwind distance that appear to be governed by both the
   upwind conditions and the growing local boundary layer. Cross-spectra of
   the vertical fluxes suggested that at lower frequencies the vertical
   motions preceded changes in temperature and humidity, whereas at higher
   frequencies the changes in the scalars led the changes in vertical
   motions. This suggests that large eddies generated over the upwind
   surface were essentially independent of the stability of the local
   boundary layer growing over the new surface. These findings suggest
   possible mechanisms for the recent observations that local similarity is
   not valid under these conditions.
   Observations of ramps of humidity and temperature at all downwind
   locations suggest that coherent structures were common. Intermittency of
   fluxes was estimated with a simple procedure, and suggested that a
   substantial portion of the fluxes occurred during intermittent events.
   More analyses of coherent structures and intermittency are needed to
   better understand the mechanisms of transport under advection
   conditions. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This paper quantifies the levels of uncertainty in rainfall-runoff model
   predictions due to the errors in hydrological and climatic data, and
   considers the implications for prediction of the hydrologic effect of
   land-use changes. In this study, a rainfall-runoff model, the Monash
   model, was calibrated on one catchment from each of at five experimental
   areas in Victoria, Australia. The validity of the optimised parameters
   was first examined by comparing them with independent estimates. Using
   the posterior distribution of the pan coefficient and model parameter
   estimates, the uncertainty of model predictions was determined by 90\%
   prediction limits obtained from a Monte-Carlo simulation. The effects of
   systematic errors in the model parameters and model inputs (rainfall and
   evaporation) on runoff were also investigated. The analysis showed that
   systematic errors in rainfall have the most serious effect on predicted
   flows, but that estimation errors (random) in pan coefficient and model
   parameters also have significant effects. With this level of background
   `noise', up to 65\% of the catchment forest area would have to be
   cleared to produce flow increases detectable at the 90\% prediction
   level, depending on the type of errors and the catchment in question.

Abstract = {{The effect of applied water on water use in Tamarix ramosissima
   (saltcedar) was investigated along the Virgin River (SE Nevada) during a
   hot, dry summer period. Water was applied to 4 m(2) (2 m x 2 m) basins
   surrounding Tamarix thickets once per week for 6 weeks. Irrigations were
   applied at 0, 50 or 100\% of the previous weeks potential
   evapotranspiration estimate using a modified Penman equation.
   Transpiration was monitored with stem flow gauges, soil moisture with
   time domain reflectometry and plant water relations with a steady state
   porometer and pressure chamber. Results indicated that at least 4 weeks
   of irrigation were required before a significant increase in water use
   by Tamarix would occur, Sap flow measurements indicated that Tamarix
   growing in closed stands (canopy over-lapping on three or more sides)
   transpired higher amounts of water than Tamarix growing in open stands
   (canopy not over-lapping on any sides). Ratios of post- to pre-depth
   weighted salinity in the 0-60 cm depth indicated that water uptake was
   occurring in this soil region by Tamarix growing in closed stands to a
   greater extent than in open stands. A multiple regression equation
   accounted for 87\% of the variability (P = 0.001) in Tamarix
   transpiration normalized on a stand volume basis when irrigation volume,
   leaf area density and average ratio of height to distance of nearest
   neighboring trees were included in the equation. We conclude that any
   attempt to characterize evapotranspiration of mature stands of Tamarix
   will require a detailed spatial assessment of stand density and an
   evaluation of water availability relative to atmospheric water demand
   over time and that it is doubtful under typical hot, dry summer
   conditions that Tamarix would effectively utilize water from most summer
   rainfall events. However, if alterations occurred along the river that
   increased the availability of water to Tamarix, increased transpiration
   rates would occur with time. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents the results of a study aimed at determining the water
   balance of small dredging lakes located in the temperate climatic zone
   (southern Austria) and their impact on the adjacent groundwater field
   using heavy stable isotopes of water, deuterium and oxygen-18. The
   isotope method of determining water balance of groundwater-controlled
   lakes was examined in some detail using the field data collected during
   this study. The calculations performed for different sets of input data
   revealed that the approach recommended in the literature, i.e. the use
   of oxygen-18 data, the air-based temperatures and the mean isotopic
   composition of evaporation flux calculated from the annual mean isotopic
   composition of precipitation assuming isotope equilibrium at the
   ground-level temperature, may lead to groundwater inflow rates which are
   underestimated by as much as 40\%, The isotope-mass balance calculations
   performed independently for deuterium and oxygen-18 data can be
   reconciled within the overall uncertainty of the method, when the
   surface water temperature of a lake (with relative humidity adjusted
   accordingly) is used instead of ground-level air temperature, and the
   isotopic composition of the evaporation flux is adequately averaged,
   taking into account the seasonal variability of this flux for the given
   lake system.
   The sensitivity analysis of the isotope-mass balance calculations
   performed for the studied lake system suggests that the critical
   parameter for the overall accuracy of the method is the isotopic
   composition of the lake water and, to a lesser extent, of the subsurface
   inflow, in cases where the isotope enrichment of lake water is
   relatively small. In the studied case this enrichment reached only about
   20\% of the isotopic composition of the input. In general, the use of
   isotope-mass balance for determining subsurface inflow and outflow rates
   to dredging lakes would require a rather extensive monitoring of isotope
   and hydrological parameters of the studied system, performed on a
   monthly basis for at least one full hydrological year.
   The isotope and geochemical data gathered in the present study were used
   to derive mixing proportions of lake water with the downgradient
   groundwater field. The plume of the lake water could be traced up to
   about 4 km from the lakes, along the general direction of groundwater
   flow. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Several hundred sinkholes, swamps and open drainage boreholes throughout
   the semi-arid to sub-humid areas of the southeast of South Australia are
   potential recharge sites to the upper part of the Gambler Limestone
   aquifer. This paper presents the results from a hydrochemical (Cl- and
   carbonate chemistry) and isotopic (delta(2)H, delta(18)O and Cl-36)
   study used to estimate the importance of localised recharge from these
   point-source features to the karstic groundwater system. Results show
   that water recharging the groundwater via point-source features is
   detectable only on a local scale. Chemical and isotopic compositions of
   groundwaters more than 150 m from the larger of the point-source
   features are indistinguishable from regional groundwater compositions.
   Chloride concentrations, carbonate chemistry, and isotope data show that
   annual input of water via point sources contributes less than 10\% of
   total recharge, with diffuse recharge providing the remainder to the
   study area as a whole. Point-source recharge is generally intermittent,
   and was observed to occur only for a few days at a time and only after a
   threshold of sustained rainfall had been exceeded (i.e. greater than 2.5
   mm day(-1) for more than 3 days).
   The stable isotopic composition of waters recharging via sinkholes tends
   to be enriched in H-2 and O-18 relative to regional groundwater and
   local precipitation. This is probably caused by a small degree of
   evaporation (less than 5\% of water falling within the catchment)
   occurring during winter at high relative humidity (greater than 95\%)
   before recharge, Cl-36 from weapons testing is detectable in
   groundwaters near sinkholes and indicates significant retardation of Cl-
   within soils of the respective sub-drainage systems. Recharge has
   therefore occurred within the past 30 years, but cannot be quantified
   with any reliable precision from the Cl-36 data. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nonlinear least squares (NLS) with automatic differentiation was used to
   estimate aquifer parameters from drawdown data obtained from published
   pumping tests conducted in homogeneous, water-table aquifers. The method
   is based on a technique that seeks to minimize the squares of residuals
   between observed and calculated drawdown subject to bounds that are
   placed on the parameter of interest. The analytical model developed by
   Neuman for flow to a partially penetrating well of infinitesimal
   diameter situated in an infinite, homogeneous and anisotropic aquifer
   was used to obtain calculated drawdown. NLS was first applied to
   synthetic drawdown data from a hypothetical but realistic aquifer to
   demonstrate that the relevant hydraulic parameters (storativity,
   specific yield, and horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity) can
   be evaluated accurately. Next the method was used to estimate the
   parameters at three field sites with widely varying hydraulic
   properties. NLS produced unbiased estimates of the aquifer parameters
   that are close to the estimates obtained with the same data using a
   visual curve-matching approach. Small differences in the estimates are a
   consequence of subjective interpretation introduced in the visual
   approach. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{To study water and solute movement in a stony sloping (35\%) soil, two
   tracers were applied to a Rendoll soil under a beech forest. From May to
   November, the movement of the tracers (Cl- and Br-) induced by natural
   rainfall was monitored by soil water sampling. Although the soil water
   transported the tracers mainly vertically, part of them flowed parallel
   to the soil surface within the topmost 15 cm. At the end of the
   experiment, the peak concentrations reached depths between 65 and 105
   cm. These values, together with the measured mean water content, showed
   that about 40\% of the throughfall was evaporated by the understory

Abstract = {{Steady downward water flow through a vadose zone of sloping strata of
   different materials is studied. The resulting streamlines are mostly
   vertical but are deflected at the strata interfaces depending on the
   related unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions and the flow rate,
   Updip or downdip deflection can occur for either fine over coarse or
   coarse over fine material. This phenomenon is of particular interest as
   related to flow regimes and the diversion capacity around buried wastes,
   and in the engineering design of capillary barriers. Assuming that the
   pressure head distribution is only a function of the normal distance
   from the sloping interface, which allows a one-dimensional analysis, we
   calculated pressure profiles, streamlines and deflection distances. The
   calculations confirm that a considerable downdip deflection can occur
   for low flow rates and a finer-textured soil overlying a coarser
   material. Updip deflections are most likely to be significant for high
   flow velocities, which occur for artificial recharge or humid climates.

Abstract = {{The turnover of radioactive caesium was studied experimentally and
   theoretically in a forested catchment that was covered by snow during
   the wet deposition of radioactive nuclides from the Chernobyl accident.
   The study spans from 1 week before to 8 years after the deposition
   event. A fraction of the catchment is covered by a mire (16\%). From the
   edge of the mire a stream channel runs to the outlet of the catchment.
   Two phases of decreasing activity concentration in the stream water were
   found in addition to a positive influence of runoff on the activity
   concentration in the stream. The half-lives for Cs-137 in the stream
   water corresponding to the early and the later phase were estimated by
   non-linear regression to be 6.5 days and 4 years, respectively. During
   the first phase, which corresponded to the initial snow melt in 1986,
   6.8\% of the deposition was lost from the catchment, whereas the slow
   secondary loss during the following 8 years was 1.8\%. The main
   contribution to the yearly discharge of Cs-137 occurred during spring
   and autumn when the areal contribution to saturated surface runoff was
   highest. The remaining deposition in soil a few years after the fallout
   was significantly lower in the mire than in the surrounding forest. By
   using the calculated activity concentration of Cs-137 in the stream
   water together with the remaining deposition in the different biotopes
   and information on stream flow for the catchment it was concluded that
   the loss originated from the mire. During the initial phase 44\% of the
   deposition was lost from the mire, and during the following years the
   yearly loss was 30\% from the fraction that constantly undergoes
   saturated surface runoff and 2\% from the drier fractions of the mire.
   Until the end of the study it was not possible to demonstrate any loss
   from the recharge areas (podzol and cambisol soils), which means that
   physical decay will govern the decrease in activity in these areas. (C)

   their recharge history and age}},

Abstract = {{The scarcity of water resources in Jordan imposes strategic difficulties
   for economic development and has been a basis for disputes with
   neighbouring countries, A welcomed discovery in the past decade is the
   occurrence of artesian thermal groundwaters at Mukhebeh in the lower
   Yarmouk valley, which produce over 40 x 10(6) m(3) year(-1) of fresh
   water, The principal resources occur in the upper B2 Formation
   (Campanian), a limestone overlain by confining marls of the B3 Formation
   (Maastrichtian), Additional resources are found near by along the
   eastern Jordan Rift Valley (JRV), in the underlying A7 limestone
   (Turonian).
   Groundwaters in the Mukhebeh (B2) wells are low salinity (500 mg l(-1)
   TDS) Ca(Mg)-HCO3 waters with elevated HS- attributed to sulphate
   reduction driven by oxidation of aquifer-derived organic matter, The JRV
   (A7) groundwaters are similar to the B2 waters with the exception of
   higher Mg2+ and HCO3- attributed to dolomite dissolution and sulphate
   reduction. Groundwaters from JRV1 and the Maqla spring at Mukhebeh are
   NaCl waters with a strong Ca(Mg)-HCO3 facies (900 to 1000 mg l(-1) TDS),
   The elevated temperatures of all groundwaters (30 to 54 degrees C) can
   be attributed to heating along a local geothermal gradient of 2.5
   degrees C per 100 m. Departures from this gradient are due to vertical
   flow in fault zones and possibly to the local influence of an intrusion
   (MK-7).
   All groundwaters are characterized by a late Holocene (modern) stable
   isotope signature. Groundwaters from the high yielding upper B2 aquifer
   (MK wells) have a delta(18)O/delta(2)H composition demonstrating
   recharge in the B2 outcrop region, near and to the east of Irbid, within
   the Yarmouk River basin. Conversely, the deeper A7 aquifer groundwaters
   (JRV wells) are recharged at a lower elevation in the rift valley
   margin, where incised wadis have exposed these strata. The deepest A1 to
   A6 strata (Maqla spring and JRV1 well) contain the isotopically most
   depleted groundwaters, Based on comparison with precipitation and
   phreatic groundwaters, recharge in the highest landscape of northern
   Jordan is likely, although a source of recharge from the northern Golan
   region of Syria cannot be excluded.
   All thermal waters are essentially H-3-free. Estimates of their mean
   subsurface residence times have been constrained on the basis of
   C-14(DIC). Significant corrections have been made for C-14-dilution
   processes including carbonate dissolution, sulphate reduction and a
   tertiary process involving either incorporation of mantle CO2 or matrix
   exchange. All dilution processes were quantified on the basis of
   geochemical and C-13 mass balance equations. Modelled ages show that
   recharge for most B2 and A7 groundwaters occurred during the late
   Holocene (recent to 5 ka BP). (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis presented here deals with the annual precipitation levels
   and the number of rainy days a year as observed in several countries
   located along the Gulf of Guinea (Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin,
   Nigeria) during the decades from the 1950s to the 1980s, The study is
   based on a set of methods used both for the interpolation and the
   cartographic representation of the results as well as on statistical
   methods for the detection of breaks in the rime series, It is possible
   through them to underscore a climatic variability at the regional level
   at the end of the 1960s and at the beginning of the 1970s, with,
   however, an important variability in space of the intensity of the
   phenomenon. The conclusions drawn previously from the study conducted on
   Cote d'Ivoire do not constitute a unique case. Generally speaking, it
   can be asserted that the whole region of humid west Africa was affected

Abstract = {{The hydrology of active volcanic islands and the interactions between
   cold groundwater Bow and hot magmatic fluids are, as yet, poorly
   understood, In this study of the Piton de la Fournaise, Reunion, we try
   to estimate the different terms in the hydrologic balance and describe
   the nature and importance of groundwater flow in an active volcano. A
   challenging aspect of this study was that only limited data were
   available, a common feature of such systems, There were some
   volcanologic data, few hydrologic data and a deep geothermal borehole
   where a thermal profile had been established.
   First, we develop a global hydrologic model of the Piton de la Fournaise
   by making certain assumptions concerning groundwater pathways. This
   model is calibrated on the available hydrologic data. We then build a
   thermal model of the volcano based on hypotheses of its internal
   structure and on the groundwater flow pattern derived from the first
   model. This model is fitted on the thermal profile.
   We conclude that groundwater flow inside the volcano can be described as
   a succession of local perched aquifers, which eventually release water
   to a continuous basal aquifer close to the coast, with diffuse outlets
   to the ocean. The infiltrating water is kept away from the magma chamber
   by a thick impervious shell surrounding the chamber, probably created by
   silica precipitation in the fractured basalt. Heat is essentially
   conveyed to the ocean by groundwater Bow. This model is likely to be
   valid for other active hot-spot volcanoes.}},

Abstract = {{A biophysically based distributed parameter ecohydrological catchment
   model, TOPOG\_IRM, is described which predicts the dynamic interactions
   between soil-vegetation-atmosphere systems over a catchment, The
   physiological control on transpiration is formulated using canopy
   resistance defined as a function of the net assimilation rate, the
   relative humidity and CO2 concentration at the leaf surface. Rainfall
   infiltration, runoff and redistribution are simulated with the Richards
   equation and evapotranspiration is calculated using the Penman-Monteith
   equation, Two innovative features of the model are (1) coupling of the
   vegetation-atmosphere system by changing the value of the vapour
   pressure deficit of air in the canopy, and (2) the plant carbon balance,
   which allows the simulation of plant growth using a saturation rate
   kinetics formulation, The model was validated using evapotranspiration,
   soil moisture and leaf area index measurements from Wagga Wagga, N.S.W.,
   Australia, for a period of 1992-1993. The calculated evapotranspiration
   was in good agreement with the observations, The soil moisture content
   at various depths was well simulated for two typical sites, The model
   also reasonably reproduced leaf area index of wheat and canola for two
   growing seasons. The success of the model simulations was due to the
   reasonably realistic treatment of the soil and canopy processes, The
   sensitivity analysis indicated that (1) the maximum assimilation rate of
   carbon affects canopy transpiration significantly, and (2) the total
   drainage is sensitive to the lower boundary conditions and the saturated
   hydraulic conductivity. TOPOG\_IRM is a valuable tool in studying
   catchment responses under different land management practices, However,
   the application of the model is limited by the large amount of data
   required regarding soil and vegetation properties, and their spatial
   distribution.}},

Abstract = {{A highly efficient technique is developed to obtain the best
   least-squares approximation of the missing hydrological data in the
   single-variable case, and this is presented here, The technique is based
   on an appropriate weighing of the estimated values generated by two
   autoregressive processes operating, respectively, in the forward and
   backward directions of time.
   For the multivariable case, the originality of the work presented here
   consists in the use of the linear regression model with variable
   coefficients to estimate missing data, As for the single-variable case,
   two multivariable regression models are calibrated recursively on
   available data preceding and following the period of missing data.
   The use of Kalman filter (KF) has improved the accuracy in the
   estimation of the first missing data including the peak flow. For
   subsequent missing data the confidence of the estimates is greater when
   using a static model identified by the ordinary least squares (OLS)
   technique, It has been found that there is a critical rank for which
   there is an inversion of performance between the KF and OLS technique.
   When the period of missing data is smaller than the critical rank we use
   only KF technique, When the period of missing data extends past the
   critical rank, it is recommended that KF be used to estimate the first
   missing data and then use OLS technique to estimate data coming after
   the critical rank. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The advective term in the one-dimensional transport equation, when
   numerically discretized, produces artificial diffusion. To minimize such
   artificial diffusion, which vanishes only for Courant number equal to
   unity, transport owing to advection has been modeled separately. The
   numerical solution of the advection equation for a Gaussian initial
   distribution is well established; however, large oscillations are
   observed when applied to an initial distribution with steep gradients,
   such as trapezoidal distribution of a constituent or propagation of mass
   from a continuous input. In this study, the application of seven
   finite-difference schemes and one polynomial interpolation scheme is
   investigated to solve the transport equation for both Gaussian and
   non-Gaussian (trapezoidal) initial distributions.
   The results obtained from the numerical schemes are compared with the
   exact solutions. A constant advective velocity is assumed throughout the
   transport process. For a Gaussian distribution initial condition, all
   eight schemes give excellent results, except the Lax scheme which is
   diffusive. In application to the trapezoidal initial distribution,
   explicit finite-difference schemes prove to be superior to implicit
   finite-difference schemes because the latter produce large numerical
   oscillations near the steep gradients. The Warming-Kutler-Lomax (WKL)
   explicit scheme is found to be better among this group, The Hermite
   polynomial interpolation scheme yields the best result for a trapezoidal
   distribution among all eight schemes investigated. The second-order
   accurate schemes are sufficiently accurate for most practical problems,
   but the solution of unusual problems (concentration with steep gradient)
   requires the application of higher-order (e.g. third- and fourth-order)
   accurate schemes. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Measurement of the groundwater flux and the consequent advection of
   dissolved carbon (DOC (dissolved organic carbon), CH4 and CO2) were made
   in a boreal peatland in northern Sweden in summer 1993. The early summer
   gradients in hydraulic head indicated a downward flux of water in the
   peatland, but after a persistent mid-summer dry period the gradients
   changed to produce an outward radial flow from the centre to the mar ins
   of the peatland, This shift in gradients corresponded to the removal of
   some of CH4 and CO2 dissolved in groundwater. The concentrations of
   dissolved CH4 and CO2 were, spatially variable, with the highest
   observed in the centre of the peatland. In contrast, DOC concentrations
   were relatively constant near the centre of the peatland and switched in
   the margin from being the highest during dry periods to lowest during
   wet periods. The changes in concentration of CH4, CO2, and DOC are a
   function of the seasonal patterns of production and consumption, but
   groundwater Row is significant in the redistribution of dissolved carbon
   and the spatial patterns of concentration. The calculated mass flux of
   dissolved carbon was significant: it was approximately 20\% of annual
   CO2 fixation. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Whether for the management of an aquifer or to locate new wells,
   hydrogeologists have always tried to establish transmissivity maps of
   regional aquifers with the highest possible accuracy. Classically, the
   transmissivity is obtained from well tests and/or from calibrating a
   groundwater flow model on the piezometric data, In this paper, we
   investigate the possibility of adding new information to improve the
   estimates of the transmissivity in a shallow chalk aquifer, i.e. the
   characteristics of certain morphological features, here referred to as
   `lynchets', which are short lineaments that can be seen on aerial
   photographs or on topographic maps and represent a sudden breach in
   slope of the ground surface. We implicitly associate the density of
   these features with the density of vertical fracturing of the chalk,
   which is linked to the transmissivity, We selected the chalk aquifer of
   Northern France to test this approach. Using numerical and
   geostatistical techniques to construct maps of the density of the
   lynchets, we compared them with transmissivity maps produced either by
   calibrating a groundwater flow model with piezometric data or by kriging
   the transmissivity values obtained with well tests, We conclude that the
   lynchet information is clearly correlated with the transmissivity, and
   that this information can best be used by cokriging as a second variable
   associated with the well test data. Incidentally, to fit our
   geostatistical models of spatial variability (variogram), we use a new
   technique called the `integral semi-variogram', which is ideally suited
   to cases such as this where the spatial distribution of the data is such
   that the data points cannot easily be grouped into pairs of increasing
   lag distance. This new technique is described briefly. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of randomized cloud seeding on daily depth of runoff, during
   27 years of experiments in central Israel, is estimated through data for
   a small watershed. The estimation is carried out with respect to depths
   of precipitation over the watershed and at two control areas, Double
   ratio and linear regression models are applied for this estimation.
   Distribution of rainfall depths by intensities and of seeding results
   with respect to wind direction are also examined. Differing results are
   obtained for the four individual experiments, each carried out over a
   period of 6 years. These reflect sampling variations in the properties
   of precipitation and runoff. A comparison of variables at the control
   areas, between seeded and unseeded allocations, indicates that an
   equipoise has existed over the entire experimental period. The results
   for this period are a 19\% increase in the number of runoff days under
   seeded allocation, a similarity in the lower halves of the distributions
   of daily runoff depths along with marked differences in the upper
   halves, a 15\% increase in the mean daily depth of immediate runoff and
   a 36\% enhancement of the total depth of runoff under seeded allocation.
   These values are considerably lower than those obtained in former
   studies on three small watersheds located in northern Israel. Volumetric
   ratio of runoff to rainfall on days with northwesterly winds is higher
   than that on days with southwesterly winds, This reflects a relation
   between wind direction and properties of rainfall associated with
   generation of runoff. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Title = {{Physics of the spatially averaged snowmelt process}},

Abstract = {{It has been recognized that the snowmelt models developed in the past do
   not fully meet current prediction requirements. Part of the reason is
   that they do not account for the spatial variation in the dynamics of
   the spatially heterogeneous snowmelt process. Most of the current
   physics-based distributed snowmelt models utilize point-location-scale
   conservation equations which do not represent the spatially varying
   snowmelt dynamics over a grid area that surrounds a computational node.
   In this study, to account for the spatial heterogeneity of the snowmelt
   dynamics, areally averaged mass and energy conservation equations for
   the snowmelt process are developed. As a first step, energy and mass
   conservation equations that govern the snowmelt dynamics at a point
   location are averaged over the snowpack depth, resulting in depth
   averaged equations (DAE). In this averaging, it is assumed that the
   snowpack has two layers. Then, the point location DAE are averaged over
   the snowcover area. To develop the areally averaged equations of the
   snowmelt physics, we make the fundamental assumption that snowmelt
   process is spatially ergodic. The snow temperature and the snow density
   are considered as the stochastic variables. The areally averaged
   snowmelt equations are obtained in terms of their corresponding ensemble
   averages. Only the first two moments are considered. A numerical
   solution scheme (Runge-Kutta) is then applied to solve the resulting
   system of ordinary differential equations. This equation system is
   solved for the areal mean and areal variance of snow temperature and of
   snow density, fbr the areal mean of snowmelt, and for the areal
   covariance of snow temperature and snow density. The developed model is
   tested using Scott Valley (Siskiyou County, California) snowmelt and
   meteorological data. The performance of the model in simulating the
   observed areally averaged snowmelt is satisfactory.}},

Abstract = {{The sensitivity of Acheloos river hood events at the outfall of the
   mountainous Mesochora catchment in Central Greece was analysed under
   various scenarios of global climate change. The climate change pattern
   was simulated through a set of hypothetical and monthly GISS (Goddard
   Institute for Space Studies) scenarios of temperature increase coupled
   with precipitation changes. The daily outflow of the catchment, which is
   dominated by spring snowmelt runoff, was simulated by the coupling of
   snowmelt and soil moisture accounting models of the US National Weather
   Service River Forecast System, Two threshold levels were used to define
   a flood day-the double and triple long-term mean daily streamflow-and
   the flood parameters (occurrences, duration, magnitude, etc.) for these
   cases were determined. Despite the complicated response of flood events
   to temperature increase and threshold, both hypothetical and monthly
   GISS representations of climate change resulted in more and longer flood
   events for climates with increased precipitation. All climates yielded
   larger flood volumes and greater mean values of flood peaks with respect
   to precipitation increase. The lower threshold resulted in more and
   longer flood occurrences, as well as smaller flood volumes and peaks
   than those of the upper one. The combination of higher and frequent
   flood events could lead to greater risks of inundation and possible
   damage to structures. Furthermore, the winter swelling of the streamflow
   could increase erasion of the river bed and banks and hence modify the
   river profile.}},

Title = {{Annual mesoscale study of water balance in a Great Basin heterogeneous

Abstract = {{We studied the annual mesoscale water balance in northeastern Nevada,
   USA, in a Great Basin heterogeneous semi-arid desert valley (the Goshute
   Valley) at 40 degrees 44'N, 114 degrees 26'W, with elevation of 1707 m
   above mean sea-level. This north-south-oriented flat valley has an area
   of about 1113 km(2) and is partially covered mostly by sagebrush,
   greasewood, shadscale, desert molly, cheatgrass, and winter fat bushes.
   Five Bowen ratio stations measured the incoming and outgoing (reflected)
   solar radiation, net radiation, air temperatures and moisture at 1 and 2
   m, the aggregated (soil + vegetation) surface temperature, wind speed
   and direction at 10 m, soil heat Bur at 8 cm (three locations at each
   station), soil temperatures at 2 and 6 cm above each soil flux plate,
   and precipitation every 5 s averaged to 20 min throughout the valley
   from 1 May 1993 to 30 September 1994. Locations of stations were based
   upon the vegetation types and percentage of coverage by bushes. The
   topsoil (10 cm) moisture content was measured either by time domain
   reflectometer or gravimetric method at least once a week. We used the
   Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) method for the measurement of 20 min
   evapotranspiration throughout the experiment. During the dry water year
   1993-1994 (beginning from 1 October) the average amount of aggregated
   (soil + bushes) evapotranspiration (ET,) among stations measured by the
   BREB method was almost equal to the average total precipitation for the
   entire valley (160.9 mm vs. 157.7 mm, respectively). Variations of
   precipitation among stations (ranging from 173.7 mm at Station 2 to
   130.5 mm at Station 1) were attributed to winter orographic effects and
   summer thermal lows. ETa ranged from 181.2 mm at Station 3 to 142.7 mm
   at Station 2. Variations were related mostly to vegetation types and
   percentage of the soil coverage. All stations showed slight water losses
   (ET, greater than precipitation) in the dry water year 1993-1994, except
   at Station 2, where water gain was about 31.1 mm. The 1993-1994 water
   losses at Stations 1, 3, 4 and 5 were 29.7 mm, 7.5 mm, 8.1 mm and 2 mm,
   respectively. The additional water for the process of evapotranspiration
   at these stations may be due to extraction of moisture from the air
   during the cool early mornings throughout the water year or to
   extraction of moisture from the soil. A set of relationships between the
   incoming solar and net radiation, surface and 2 m air temperatures, and
   surface and 8 cm soil heat fluxes among stations was also developed.
   This study showed how the mesoscale water balance was achieved during a
   dry water year in a desert valley. The findings could be applied to
   similar valleys.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorofluorocarbons, H-3/He-3 and Kr-85 are tracers of atmospheric
   origin that can be used to date groundwater over periods from 0 to 40
   years. In suitable aquifers, measured groundwater ages can be used to
   estimate groundwater flow paths, and vertical and horizontal flow
   velocities. In simple, piston flow systems they can be used to estimate
   groundwater recharge rates with an accuracy of 20\% or less, better than
   can be achieved with traditional hydraulic-based methods. Groundwater
   dating methods have also been used to reconstruct past releases of
   contaminants to aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{Data from a string of instrumented wells located on an upland of 55 m
   width between two wetlands In central North Dakota, USA, indicated
   frequent changes in water-table configuration following wet and dry
   periods during 5 years of investigation, A seasonal wetland is situated
   about 1.5 m higher than a nearby semipermanent wetland, suggesting an
   average ground water-table gradient of 0.02. However, water had the
   potential to flow as ground water from the upper to the lower wetland
   during only a few instances, A water-table trough adjacent to the lower
   semipermanent wetland was the most common water-table configuration
   during the first 4 years of the study, but it is likely that severe
   drought during those years contributed to the longevity and extent of
   the water-table trough, Water-table mounds that formed In response to
   rainfall events caused reversals of direction of flow that frequently
   modified the more dominant water-table trough during the severe drought.
   Rapid and large water-table rise to near land surface in response to
   intense rainfall was aided by the thick capillary fringe. One of the
   wettest summers on record ended the severe drought during the last year
   of the study, and caused a larger-scale water-table mound to form
   between the two wetlands. The mound was short in duration because it was
   overwhelmed by rising stage of the higher seasonal wetland which spilled
   into the lower wetland. Evapotranspiration was responsible for
   generating the water-table trough that formed between the two wetlands,
   Estimation of evapotranspiration based on diurnal fluctuations in wells
   yielded rates that averaged 3-5 mm day(-1). On many occasions water
   levels in wells closer to the semipermanent wetland indicated a
   direction of Bow that was different from the direction indicated by
   water levels in wells farther from the wetland. Misinterpretation of
   direction and magnitude of gradients between ground water and wetlands
   could result from poorly placed or too few observation wells, and also
   from infrequent measurement of water levels in wells.}},

Abstract = {{The role of macropores in infiltration through a sandy loam was studied
   using laboratory columns pretreated with water possessing a delta(18)O
   signature of -8.7 parts per thousand and 15 mg l(-1) Cl-. A simulated
   snowmelt pulse of delta(18)O-depleted water containing 1100 mg l(-1) Cl-
   was added to a control column and two columns containing a single
   vertical macropore, one continuous and the other discontinuous,
   Macropores were formed in situ by disintegration of a biodegradable foam
   thread inserted during column packing. Macropores were 2 mm in diameter,
   which has been suggested to be the threshold for significant macropore
   flow given the soil's mean textural pore diameter of 0.41 mm. Meltwater
   was flushed from the columns by adding two pore volumes of isotopically
   enriched water containing 15 mg l(-1) Cl- at a rate of 17.2 mm day(-1).
   Tensiometers, time domain reflectometry probes and suction samplers were
   used to monitor matric potential, soil water content and soil water
   chemistry at 0.1 m Intervals down the columns, Column effluent was
   sampled daily for delta(18)O and Cl-. Mobile soil water contents
   (theta(m)) and dispersivities (epsilon) were estimated by fitting a
   one-dimensional analytical solution of the convection-dispersion
   equation to Cl- breakthrough curves (BTCs). theta(m) increased with
   depth in all columns, whereas only the discontinuous macropore column
   showed an increase in epsilon with flow length. Cl- and delta(18)O
   breakthrough occurred earlier at all depths in the macropore columns
   relative to the control, resulting in larger epsilon values for
   macroporous soil. epsilon for a given Raw length tended to be greatest
   in the discontinuous macropore column, reflecting the role of internal
   catchment processes, Macropore presence was associated with decreased
   theta(m) during infiltration and bimodal BTCs in column effluent. The
   threshold ratio of macropore-to-micropore diameters at which macropores
   exert a detectable influence on water transport must be less than that
   examined here. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Flow characteristics were studied in the Northwestern Peninsula of
   Yucatan, Mexico. The Yucatan aquifer is a mature karst system,
   influenced by the Ring of Cenotes (sinkholes). This zone of aligned
   sinkholes is a high-permeability zone with respect to its surroundings.
   The aquifer is unconfined within the study area. Water-level
   measurements at 48 locations were made in June and October 1994; they
   were measured up to four times in October. Water levels in a limited
   group of wells showed variations up to 60\% during October 1994 whereas
   others had variations of the order of 5\% in the same period. By
   studying the resulting equipotential regimes, a highly variable zone
   (HVZ) was identified. Drain characteristics are significantly different
   from the rest of the study area, which leads to the hypothesis that the
   HVZ represents an independent subsystem of interconnected fractures. To
   determine directions of high permeability within the study area.
   azimuthal resistivity surveys were conducted at 22 locations.
   Resistivity curves particularly in the HVZ show two or more peaks, each
   indicating a direction of high permeability. Directions of high
   permeability are interpreted to be preferential directions of aligned
   fractures. Comparison with the two different equipotential regimes in
   October 1994 shows that in the majority of the cases the direction of
   the hydraulic gradient coincides with the direction of one fracture
   system. The hydraulic gradient can be considered to be the major control
   in the dissolution process at least in the HVZ, resulting in the
   selective opening of the fractures. Peaks in the resistivity curves are
   of the same order of magnitude. This shows that both regimes of
   equipotential lines and the corresponding changes of the hydraulic
   gradients are sufficiently frequent to be able to create different
   fracture systems with a comparable fracture density. The variations of
   the equipotential regime in time may have severe consequences in terms
   of the risk of aquifer contamination in the highly variable zone.
   Contaminants, generated mainly in the city of Merida, are generally
   believed to flow towards the north coast of the Peninsula. However,
   reversals in the hydraulic gradient may allow contaminants to flow
   towards the southeast of the city, at least for limited periods in the
   year.}},

Abstract = {{The storage function hydrograph model is one of the most commonly used
   models for flood runoff analysis in Japan, This paper studies the
   generality of the approach and its application to Japanese basins.
   Through a comparison of the basic equations for the models, the storage
   function model parameters, K, Pt and T-1, are shown to be related to the
   terms, k and p, in the kinematic wave model, This analysis showed that P
   and p are identical and K and T-1 can be related to k, the basin area
   and its land use.
   To apply the storage function model throughout Japan, regional parameter
   relationships for K and T-1 were developed for different land-use
   conditions using data from 22 watersheds and 91 flood events, These
   relationships combine the kinematic wave parameters with general
   topographic information using Hack's Law. The sensitivity of the
   parameters and their physical significance are also described. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{`Aggregation' refers to spatial averaging of some heterogeneous surface
   variable to obtain an effective value representative of an area. The
   effect of surface heterogeneity an interactions between land and
   atmosphere is relevant to near-surface hydrology, ecology, and climate,
   and is the common theme of the papers in this issue. Even though the
   full effect of heterogeneity must be neglected owing to limited spatial
   resolution of large-scale models, it is important to understand when and
   how the presence of heterogeneity requires recognition in any aggregate
   representation. In March 1994, a workshop, which has come to be known as
   the `Tucson Aggregation Workshop', was convened to assess the state of
   the art in aggregation research, and the papers in this issue are the
   product of that workshop. The principal findings of the workshop can be
   summarized as follows:
   1. substantial progress has been made in producing aggregated
   representations of flat terrain. Simple aggregation rules applied to
   surface properties have given rise, in some studies, to simulated
   surface energy fluxes that are within 10\% of fluxes produced from
   models with full representation of heterogeneity.
   2. Aggregation rules are relatively straightforward in the ease of
   patch-scale heterogeneity (variability on the order of hundreds to
   thousands of meters) of vegetative characteristics which control surface
   exchanges, although aggregation of soil hydraulic properties and
   possibly of soil moisture remains problematic. In addition, some of the
   effects of meso-scale heterogeneity (variability on the order of 10-100
   km) in surface cover will need to be addressed through more complicated
   types of parameterization.
   3. There is convincing evidence that the regional energy balance (over,
   say, 10(5) km(2)) is insensitive to gentle topography, provided that
   surface vegetation and water availability are uniform, but in
   mountainous terrain the influence of topography on near-surface
   meteorology must be considered.
   4. It appears that the value of simple combinations of remotely sensed
   radiances representing areal-average measurements are influenced only
   slightly by unresolved variability, although the averaging of some
   derived variables based on these radiances offers a greater challenge,
   especially with sparse canopies.}},

Abstract = {{Topography perturbs practically every process and variable relevant to
   land-atmosphere interactions, including radiation, air temperature and
   saturation deficit, wind and turbulence, cloudiness and precipitation,
   and properties of the soil and vegetation. We review progress in
   understanding some of these influences, concentrating on the wind field
   and the exchanges of scalars (especially sensible and latent heat) over
   low to moderate hills, both without and with flow separation. The
   treatment of the wind field is based on a physical division of the flow
   into inner, outer and wake regions. This framework is used to discuss
   modelling approaches, measurements of both the mean flow and the
   turbulence, special processes in the wake region, and the effects of
   stratification.
   Scalar transfer and the surface energy balance are discussed first in
   terms of a linear theory which accommodates radiative, aerodynamic, and
   elevation perturbations on the surface energy balance over hills. The
   linear theory provides general scales for determining the relative
   magnitudes of these perturbations, but its quantitative predictions are
   limited to low slopes without separation. Next, wind tunnel experiments
   are used to study the aerodynamic perturbations on scalar transfer
   caused by hills in situations outside the scope of the linear theory,
   such as flows with separation. Finally, the wind tunnel results are
   extrapolated to the atmosphere, using the framework of a convective
   boundary layer model. It is found that, for relatively gentle
   topography, the regional surface energy balance (spatially averaged over
   several hills) is insensitive to the presence of the topography.}},

Abstract = {{A method for generating daily surfaces of temperature, precipitation,
   humidity, and radiation over large regions of complex terrain is
   presented. Required inputs include digital elevation data and
   observations of maximum temperature, minimum temperature and
   precipitation from ground-based meteorological stations. Our method is
   based on the spatial convolution of a truncated Gaussian weighting
   filter with the set of station locations. Sensitivity to the typical
   heterogeneous distribution of stations in complex terrain is
   accomplished with an iterative station density algorithm. Spatially and
   temporally explicit empirical analyses of the relationships of
   temperature and precipitation to elevation were performed, and the
   characteristic spatial and temporal scales of these relationships were
   explored. A daily precipitation occurrence algorithm is introduced, as a
   precursor to the prediction of daily precipitation amount. Surfaces of
   humidity (vapor pressure deficit) are generated as a function of the
   predicted daily minimum temperature and the predicted daily average
   daylight temperature. Daily surfaces of incident salar radiation are
   generated as a function of Sun-slope geometry and interpolated diurnal
   temperature range. The application of these methods is demonstrated over
   an area of approximately 400 000 km(2) in the northwestern USA, for 1
   year, including a detailed illustration of the parameterization process.
   A cross-validation analysis was performed, comparing predicted and
   observed daily and annual average values. Mean absolute errors (MAE) for
   predicted annual average maximum and minimum temperature were 0.7
   degrees C and 1.2 degrees C, with biases of +0.1 degrees C and -0.1
   degrees C, respectively. MAE for predicted annual total precipitation
   was 13.4 cm, or, expressed as a percentage of the observed annual
   totals, 19.3\%. The success rate for predictions of daily precipitation
   occurrence was 83.3\%. Particular attention was given to the predicted
   and observed relationships between precipitation frequency and
   intensity, and they were shown to be similar. We tested the sensitivity
   of these methods to prediction grid-point spacing, and found that areal
   averages were unchanged for grids ranging in spacing from 500 m to 32
   km. We tested the dependence of the results on timestep, and found that
   the temperature prediction algorithms scale perfectly in this respect.
   Temporal scaling of precipitation predictions was complicated by the
   daily occurrence predictions, but very nearly the same predictions were
   obtained at daily and annual timesteps. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical studies dealing with aggregation of surface parameters at
   small scale are reviewed. Finding effective parameters for surface
   resistance is possible for most cases by taking simple geometric or
   arithmetic averages of the component resistances. The use of more
   sophisticated techniques such as the blending height improves the
   calculations. Resistances for heat and water vapour behave differently
   in heterogeneous terrain. A simple surface energy balance model is
   adapted to show the behaviour of the roughness length of heat and water
   vapour in heterogeneous terrain. It is suggested that this simple
   parameterization can adequately take into account the effect of
   variation in surface cover on the fluxes of heat and water vapour.}},

Title = {{The impact of using area-averaged land surface properties - Topography,
   vegetation condition, soil wetness - In calculations of intermediate
   scale (approximately 10 km(2)) surface-atmosphere heat and moisture
   fluxes}},

Abstract = {{It is commonly assumed that biophysically based
   soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) models are scale-invariant
   with respect to the initial boundary conditions of topography,
   vegetation condition and soil moisture. In practice, SVAT models that
   have been developed and tested at the local scale (a few meters or a few
   tens of meters) are applied almost unmodified within general circulation
   models (GCMs) of the atmosphere, which have grid areas of 50-500 km(2).
   This study, which draws much of its substantive material from the papers
   of Sellers et al. (1992c, J. Geophys. Res., 97(D17): 19033-19060) and
   Sellers et al. (1995, J. Geophys. Res., 100(D12): 25607-25629), explores
   the validity of doing this. The work makes use of the FIFE-89 data set
   which was collected over a 2 km x 15 km grassland area in Kansas. The
   site was characterized by high variability in soil moisture and
   vegetation condition during the late growing season of 1989. The area
   also has moderate topography.
   The 2 km x 15 km `testbed' area was divided into 68 x 501 pixels of 30 m
   x 30 m spatial resolution, each of which could be assigned topographic,
   vegetation condition and soil moisture parameters from satellite and in
   situ observations gathered in FIFE-89. One or more of these surface
   fields was area-averaged in a series of simulation runs to determine the
   impact of using large-area means of these initial or boundary conditions
   on the area-integrated (aggregated) surface fluxes. The results of the
   study can be summarized as follows:
   1. analyses and some of the simulations indicated that the relationships
   describing the effects of moderate topography on the surface radiation
   budget are near-linear and thus largely scale-invariant. The
   relationships linking the simple ratio vegetation index (SR), the canopy
   conductance parameter (del(F)) and the canopy transpiration flux are
   also near-linear and similarly scale-invariant to first order. Because
   of this, it appears that simple area-averaging operations can be applied
   to these fields with relatively little impact on the calculated surface
   heat flux.
   2. The relationships linking surface and root-zone soil wetness to the
   soil surface and canopy transpiration rates are non-linear. However,
   simulation results and observations indicate that soil moisture
   variability decreases significantly as an area dries out, which
   partially cancels out the effects of these non-linear functions.
   In conclusion, it appears that simple averages of topographic slope and
   vegetation parameters can be used to calculate surface energy and heat
   fluxes over a wide range of spatial scales, from a few meters up to many
   kilometers at least for grassland sites and areas with moderate
   topography. Although the relationships between soil moisture and
   evapotranspiration are non-linear for intermediate soil wetnesses, the
   dynamics of soil drying act to progressively reduce soil moisture
   variability and thus the impacts of these non-linearities on the
   area-averaged surface fluxes. These findings indicate that we may be
   able to use mean values of topography, vegetation condition and soil
   moisture to calculate the surface-atmosphere fluxes of energy, heat and
   moisture al larger length scales, to within an acceptable accuracy for
   climate modeling work. However, further tests over areas with different
   vegetation types, soils and more extreme topography are required to
   improve our confidence in this approach.}},

   of moderate land-surface variability, the effective surface fluxes
   computed using a single column model forced by effective surface
   parameters are close to the areally-averaged turbulent fluxes estimated
   by a mesoscale model. A simple method fur accounting for the subgrid
   variability of intercepted rain is tested. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{With increasing interest in airborne and satellite-based sensors for
   mapping regional and global energy balance, there is a need to determine
   the uncertainty involved in aggregating remotely-sensed variables
   {[}surface temperature (T-k) and reflectance (rho)] and surface energy
   fluxes {[}sensible (H) and latent (lambda E) heat flux] over large
   areas. This uncertainty is directly related to two factors: (1) the
   non-linearity of the relation between the sensor signal and T-k, rho, H
   or lambda E; and (2) the heterogeneity of the site. In this study, we
   compiled several remotely-sensed data sets acquired at different
   locations within a semi-arid rangeland in Arizona, at a variety of
   spatial and temporal resolutions. These data sets provided the range of
   data heterogeneities necessary for an extensive analysis of data
   aggregation. The general technique to evaluate uncertainty was to
   compare remotely-sensed variables and energy balance components
   calculated in two ways: first, calculated at the pixel resolution and
   averaged to the coarser resolution; and second, calculated directly at
   the coarse resolution by aggregating the fine-resolution data to the
   coarse scale. Results showed that the error in the aggregation of T-k
   and rho was negligible for a wide range of conditions. However, the
   error in aggregation of H and lambda E was highly influenced by the
   heterogeneity of the site. Errors in H larger than 50\% were possible
   under certain conditions. The conditions associated with the largest
   aggregation errors in H were:
   sites which are composed of a mix of stable and unstable conditions;
   sites which have considerable variations in aerodynamic roughness,
   especially for highly unstable conditions where the difference between
   surface and air temperature is large; and
   sites which are characterized by patch vegetation, where the pixel
   resolution is less than or nearly-equal to the diameter of the
   vegetation `element' (in most cases, the diameter of the dominant
   vegetation type or vegetation patch).
   Thus, knowledge of the surface heterogeneity is essential for minimizing
   error in aggregation of H and lambda E. Two schemes are presented for
   quantifying surface heterogeneity as a first step in data aggregation.
   These results emphasized the need for caution in aggregation of energy
   balance components over heterogeneous landscapes with sparse or mixed
   vegetation types. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The variation in soil texture, surface moisture or vertical soil
   moisture gradient in larger scale atmospheric models may lead to
   significant variations in simulated surface fluxes of water and heat.
   The parameterization of soil moisture fluxes at spatial scales
   compatible with the grid size of distributed hydrological models and
   mesoscale atmospheric models (similar to 100 km(2)) faces principal
   problems which relate to the underlying microscopic or field scale
   heterogeneity in soil characteristics.
   The most widely used parameterization in soil hydrology, the
   Darcy-Richards (DR) equation, is gaining increasing importance in
   mesoscale and climate modelling. This is mainly due to the need to
   introduce plant-interactive soil water depletion and stomatal
   conductance parameterizations and to improve the calculation of deep
   percolation and runoff. Covering a grid of several hundreds of square
   kilometres, the DR parameterization in such
   soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer schemes (SVATs) is assumed to be
   scale-invariant. The parameters describing the non-linear, area-average
   soil hydraulic functions in this scale-invariant DR-equation should be
   treated as calibration-parameters, which do not necessarily have a
   physical meaning. The saturated hydraulic conductivity is one of the
   soil parameters to which the models show very high sensitivity. It is
   shown that saturated hydraulic conductivity can be scaled in both
   vertical and horizontal directions for large flow domains.
   In this paper, a distinction is made between effective and aggregated
   soil parameters. Effective parameters are defined as area-average values
   or distributions over a domain with a single, distinct textural soil
   type. They can be obtained by scaling or inverse modelling. Aggregated
   soil parameters represent grid-domains with several textural soil types.
   In soil science dimensional methods have been developed to scale up soil
   hydraulic characteristics. With some specific assumptions, these
   techniques can be extrapolated from classical field-scale problems in
   soil heterogeneity to larger domains, compatible with the grid-size of
   large scale models. Particularly promising is the estimation of
   effective soil hydraulic parameters from area averaging measurements
   through inverse modelling of the unsaturated flow.
   Techniques to scale and aggregate the soil characteristics presented in
   this paper qualify for direct or indirect use in large scale
   meteorological models. One of the interesting results is the effective
   behaviour of the reference curve, which can be obtained from similar
   media scaling. If the conclusions of this paper survive further studies,
   a relatively simple method will become available to parameterize soil
   variability at large scales. The inverse technique is found to provide
   effective soil parameters which perform well in predicting both the
   area-average evaporation and the area-average soil moisture fluxes, such
   as subsurface runoff. This is not the case for aggregated soil
   parameters. Obtained from regression relationships between soil textural
   composition and hydraulic characteristics, these aggregated parameters
   predict evaporation fluxes well, but fail to predict water balance terms
   such as percolation and runoff. This is a serious drawback which could
   eventually hamper the improvement of the representation of the
   hydrological cycle in mesoscale atmospheric model and in GCMs. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The effects of small-scale heterogeneity in land surface characteristics
   on the large-scale fluxes of water and energy in the land-atmosphere
   system has become a central focus of many climatology research
   experiments. The acquisition of high resolution land surface data
   through remote sensing and intensive land-climatology field experiments
   (like HAPEX, FIFE, and BOREAS) has provided data to investigate the
   interactions between microscale land-atmosphere interactions and
   macroscale models. To determine the effect of small scale
   heterogeneities, the spatially averaged evaporative fraction is
   analytically derived for spatially variable soil moisture and
   soil-atmospheric controls on evaporation at low soil moisture. This
   average evaporative fraction is compared with the evaporative fraction
   determined using the spatially averaged soil moisture, as if from a
   lumped, or aggregated, land surface model. Results show that the
   lumped-model based evaporation will over estimate evaporation during
   periods of low atmospheric demands (early morning/late afternoon, Winter
   periods, etc.) and under estimate evaporation during periods of high
   demand (midday Summer periods.) The accuracy of using `effective'
   parameters in lumped macroscale models depends on the variability of
   soil moisture and the sensitivity of the soil-vegetation system to low
   soil moisture. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The development of the limited groundwater resources of a remote
   tropical island, in particularly rugged volcanic terrain, requires a
   thorough understanding of the hydrogeology. The cost of a classical
   approach by borehole investigations often precludes a `reasoned'
   approach, resulting in a somewhat haphazard development of resources
   with varying success. This paper describes the use of multivariate
   statistical analyis to trace groundwater circulation in volcanic
   terrains. The method involves the use of principal components analysis
   (PCA) based on both structural and hydrochemical parameters of 243
   springs of Reunion (western Indian Ocean). As a result, we propose the
   use of Na/Cl analysis in differentiating three types of volcanic
   aquifers. This analysis is consistent with a geological and
   hydrogeological conceptual model developed from a combined hydrochemical
   and geological reconnaissance of 27 springs. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Volume = {{190}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{19-41}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{On the assumption that the water draining below the root zone is
   potentially available for groundwater recharge, two current UK methods
   for estimating annual groundwater recharge have been compared with a new
   soil model using data from four sites under permanent grass in the UK:
   two sites representative of the Chalk aquifer at Bridgets Farm
   (Hampshire) and Fleam Dyke (Cambridgeshire), and two sites on the
   Triassic sandstone at Bicton College (Devon) and Bacon Hall
   (Shropshire). A Four Root Layers Model (FRLM), the Penman-Grindley model
   and the UK Meteorological Office Rainfall and Evaporation Calculation
   System (MORECS) were used. The new soil model was run with potential
   evaporation as input both from the MORECS and from the Penman-Monteith
   equation. The models were run for the Chalk sites both with and without
   a bypass flow of 15\% of rainfall. Bypass was not considered for the
   sandstone sites. The performance of the models was tested against
   neutron probes measurements of soil moisture deficits. In addition, the
   annual groundwater recharge estimated from the models was compared with
   the published values obtained from the `zero flux plane' method.
   Generally, the Penman-Grindley model was more successful in predicting
   the time for soil to return to its field capacity than in predicting the
   magnitude of the soil moisture deficit. The annual groundwater recharge
   was predicted with reasonable accuracy. The MORECS relatively tended to
   overestimate the soil moisture deficits and to delay the time at which
   the soil returns to its field capacity. The consequences were
   underestimates of annual groundwater recharge, owing either to the
   higher values of potential evaporation calculated from the MORECS or to
   the high available water capacity values associated with the soils under
   consideration. The new soil model (FRLM) predicts the soil moisture
   deficits successfully and hence is reliable in estimating the annual
   groundwater recharge. The model is capable of doing this with potential
   evaporation input calculated either from the MORECS or from the
   Penman-Monteith equation. The model also demonstrated that the inclusion
   of 15\% of rainfall as bypass flow is viable for Chalk sites.}},

Abstract = {{As the demand for water in the USA rapidly approaches the total
   available water supply, it is essential that water resources be
   accurately monitored. Consequently, the National Weather Service (NWS)
   maintains a set of conceptual, continuous, hydrologic simulation models
   used to generate extended streamflow predictions, water supply outlooks,
   and flood forecasts. To obtain accurate predictions and forecasts, it is
   necessary, periodically throughout the snow season, to estimate the snow
   water equivalent in river basins throughout the USA. The estimates are
   obtained using a geostatistical model and snow course, SNOTEL, and
   airborne snow data. in this research, we develop a positive-definite
   spatial covariance function that allows researchers to incorporate
   geomorphic site attributes when snow water equivalent estimates are
   obtained. We illustrate our approach using snow course and SNOTEL data
   collected in the North Fork Clearwater River basin. Our results indicate
   that by incorporating elevation into the covariance model used for the
   North Fork Clearwater River basin we are able to improve substantially
   the accuracy of the snow water equivalent estimates.}},

Abstract = {{A streamflow recession formula for natural basins is derived by linear
   hydrologic routing of the sum of inflows from discrete, independent
   water storages through a channel storage. Water storages include
   depression, detention, snow and ice, channel bank, aquifer and cavern.
   Evapotranspiration is incorporated in the recession formula, but
   seasonal effects and basin wetness and storage conditions before storms
   are not considered, Data from seven basins involving 156
   precipitation-free recessions are used to test the performance of two-
   and three-parameter approximations to the theoretical recession formula.
   Recessions are defined to last at least 2 weeks and to begin 2 days
   after the peak of a basin outflow hydrograph, or at a point on the
   falling limb 2 days after any precipitation occurs, Recessions end when
   precipitation recommences, or when daily flow data stop decreasing. An
   inverse square formula explains most variance in the two-parameter case,
   in contrast to the simple exponential formula usually recommended for
   recession modelling. With three parameters, equally good performance is
   shown by formulae involving a constant plus an inverse square, or
   inverse cubic, or simple exponential term. These theoretically based
   formulae should be useful at basin scale for interpolating or
   extrapolating recession data, particularly in basins where little is
   known about water storage behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{The four-parameter mobile-immobile model (MIM) is often used to describe
   solute transport processes in aggregated porous media by assuming no
   advective solute transport in the aggregates or immobile zone and a
   first-order kinetic diffusion transport process between the mobile and
   immobile zones. When the concentration in the immobile zone reaches an
   equilibrium with the concentration in the mobile zone (local equilibrium
   assumption, LEA), the MIM `degenerates' to a two-parameter
   convective-dispersive model (CDE) and the MIM parameters cannot be
   accurately obtained using inverse optimization techniques. Two criteria
   to test the LEA applicability-the difference in skewness and a criterion
   derived from the SKIT (separation of kinetically influenced terms, Bahr
   and Rubin, 1987, Water Resourc. Res., 23: 438-452) method-are evaluated
   using statistical inference about model building applied to the MIM and
   CDE model. The results show that the criterion derived from the SKIT
   method evaluates the LEA applicability the best. To assess MIM parameter
   uncertainty as a function of the data uncertainty and the input boundary

   and the type of optimization used, i.e. ordinary or weighted least
   squares. Using relationships between the MIM parameters and the size and
   shape of the aggregates, it is shown that for soils consisting of
   spherical aggregates, the MIM parameters are not identifiable from
   miscible displacement experiments using water fluxes prevailing under
   climatic boundary conditions. For soils with cylindrical macropores, the
   MIM parameters can be identified even for relatively low values of the

Abstract = {{Results of oxygen isotopic measurements for rain, snow and streamwaters
   in three catchments in the Black Forest, SW Germany, for a full range of
   hydrological events (snowmelt and heavy rain following dry and wet
   antecedent conditions) are used to assess the contribution of rainfall
   and snowmelt to stream flow generation. Contrasting isotopic behaviour
   occurs. For three of the 11 events examined, the change in streamwater
   isotopic composition reflects that of the rainfall or snowmelt
   generating the hydrological response. For three other events, the direct
   contribution of rainfall and snowmelt to the stream flow generation must
   be small, as the opposite pattern occurs. For the remaining events, the
   stream isotopic composition remains constant. For most of the year, all
   three sites show similar isotopic patterns, indicating that similar
   controls regulate the isotopic composition in the stream, The isotopic
   patterns show that direct runoff from rainfall or snowmelt is only a
   minor source of stormflow response. In some cases at least two pre-event
   water types can be inferred.}},

Abstract = {{At the mouth of the river Var (Mediterranean Sea, France), the aquifer
   which is contained within recent alluvial deposits becomes confined as
   it flows under impermeable sediments of a small coastal delta. To study
   the water balance of the alluvial aquifer, we used a method of
   localization and in situ quantification of freshwater discharge into the
   sea.
   Vertical profiles of both salinity and temperature and systematic
   chemical analyses of seawater were made at 40 stations located on two
   concentric half-circle shaped routes linking the eastern bank of the
   river mouth to the southern one. Anomalies appear at some stations on
   the two routes, where, at depths of 20-60 m, profiles show a temperature
   elevation of 0.1-0.2 degrees C and a salinity decrease of 0.05-0.1 PSU
   compared with the average value (PSU is an abbreviation for `Practical
   Scale Unit', defined by SCORE-UNESCO as the new salinity unit; this unit
   corresponds to parts per thousand (per mille), which is equivalent to 1
   g of salt for 1 kg of seawater). In addition, lower than average values
   of seawater ionic concentrations of Mg2+, Ca2+ and K+ and higher than
   average content of silica, a local groundwater tracer, confirm the
   existence of freshwater discharge areas. These marine outlets are
   located where the deltaic impermeable sedimentary cover is thin or even
   nonexistent.
   An attempt to evaluate the flow rate is made by estimating the dynamic
   diffusion of the salt flux over the whole discharge area, The results
   range from 180 to 4001 s(-1), in agreement with values indirectly
   deduced from water balance calculations. The important uncertainty of
   the measurement is due to the choice of the dynamic diffusion
   coefficient (ranging from 10 to 20 m(2) day(-1)), the approximation of
   salinity variations (ranging from 0.05 to 0.1 PSU) and the thickness of
   the discharge area (ranging from 20 to 40 m).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents results of the geochemical and isotopic studies on
   groundwater samples from the Garoua Sandstone Basin, in northern
   Cameroon. Chemical and environmental isotope data are presented and
   discussed in terms of the origin of dissolved species and of
   groundwater. All of the investigated groundwaters are categorized into
   two chemical types, low mineralized and acidic waters of Ca-Na-HCO3
   type, and relatively high mineralized waters of Na-HCO3 type, with
   relatively high pH, between 7.40 and 8.22. Interpretation of chemical
   data, based upon both thermodynamic calculations and stability diagrams,
   suggests that the chemical evolution of groundwater is primarily
   controlled by water-rock interactions, involving (1) acidic weathering
   of aluminosilicates, (2) dissolution of secondary carbonate minerals,
   and (3) cation exchange of Na+ for Ca2+. However, the original
   composition of groundwater may have been modified by further secondary
   processes such as mixing of chemically different water masses, and
   anthropogenic NO3- pollution. Tritium contents in the considered
   groundwaters are very heterogeneous, suggesting differences in the water
   turnover time or in the recharge conditions, or both. On the basis of
   the geographical distribution of H-3 contents, a hydrogeological
   relation between river and the groundwater systems has been proposed for
   the study site. Interpretation of both O-18 and H-2, as well as H-3,
   suggests that the recharge of the investigated groundwaters may result
   from three major mechanisms: (1) direct infiltration of local
   precipitation; (2) lateral inflow of river waters; (3) probably upward
   leakage of old groundwaters.}},

Abstract = {{Gross rainfall, throughfall and stemflow were measured in Eucalyptus
   globulus Labill, and Pinus pinaster Ait. stands in central Portugal over
   two and a half years (from January 1992 to July 1994). The results show
   that the interception loss is higher in the pine stand (17\% of gross
   rainfall) than in the eucalypt stand (11\% of gross rainfall).
   Interception loss was also simulated by the Rutter model and Gash's
   original analytical model, but both models overestimated the
   interception loss from these Mediterranean sparse forests by 29-44\%. To
   improve the description of the rainfall interception from sparse
   forests, the Rutter model was reformulated. This new version of the
   Rutter model and a previously reformulated version of Gash's analytical
   model greatly improved the accuracy of the simulation for both forests,
   resulting in estimates of the interception loss within 3\% of the
   measured values.}},

Abstract = {{HAPEX-Sahel was an international experiment designed to provide the
   field data needed to model the climate of the Sahel and its dependence
   on land surface conditions, The design of the experiment was based on
   the study of a 1 degrees square experimental domain in which there were
   three observational supersites. At each of these supersites detailed
   hydro-meteorological studies were made at subsites for each of the three
   principal vegetation types: miller, fallow savannah and tiger bush.
   Remote sensing from satellite and aircraft was used to scale up from the
   local to the regional scale. Hydrological monitoring, from 1991 to 1993,
   was combined with an 8-week intensive observation period that covered
   the end of the wet season and the beginning of the dry season in 1992.
   The structure and content of the HAPEX-Sahel Special Issue are described
   and an introduction is given to the HAPEX-Sahel information system where

Title = {{Land surface conditions of the Niamey region: Ecological and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{188}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{18-42}},

Abstract = {{A land surface map of the region of Niamey (2-3 degrees E, 13-14 degrees
   N), Niger, derived from a classification of SPOT multispectral satellite
   data with 20 x 20-m resolution, is described. Sixteen distinct classes
   were defined based on landform, vegetation soil crust type and land use.
   The classification system was designed to emphasize the role of these
   factors in hydrological and ecological processes. The primary purpose
   was to provide information for integrating local-scale measurements of
   land-atmosphere interactions in HAPEX-Sahel (Hydrological and
   Atmospheric Pilot Experiment) up to a region 1 degrees x 1 degrees
   square, and to assist hydrologists in interpreting the spatial
   distribution of soil moisture. A large number of ground descriptions
   were integrated with high spatial resolution multispectral satellite
   reflectance data. Since most of the hydrological and atmospheric
   observations in HAPEX-Sahel were carried out in only three land cover
   types (tiger bush on the plateaux, fallow savanna and millet fields in
   the sand valley or plains), the 16 classes were merged successively into
   nine then six so that three final maps were produced, each one
   reflecting a different degree of aggregation.
   Some difficulties could not be resolved. One stemmed from the continuum
   linking land left fallow and cultivation. This uncertainty can be a
   problem since bush-fallow and cropped fields are hydrologically and
   ecologically quite distinct. Another major difficulty was the detection
   of sparse vegetation cover using the satellite data.
   Each surface condition class was assigned a range of runoff capability
   parameters derived from numerous rainfall simulation tests conducted in
   the Sahelian zone. Consequently, runoff production could be assessed for
   each 20 x 20-m pixel. However, due to the endoreic nature of the
   watersheds in the region, the use of the map to predict runoff
   production must be restricted to small areas ranging from the pixel size
   to catchments of 1-10 km(2).}},

Abstract = {{In the Sahel, rainfall is the single most important factor conditioning
   the hydrology and the climate, but comprehensive statistical analyses of
   the rainfall climatology in the region are rare. Yet, even though in the
   Sahel rainfall data are scarce by the standards of the temperate
   countries, it is shown here that it is possible to obtain a reasonably
   good idea of what the rainfall has been over Sahelian Niger for the past
   40 years, both in terms of interannual variability and spatial
   distribution. To that aim a statistical model is used, which decomposes
   the space-time fluctuations of long-term rainfall averages into the
   fluctuations of the mean event rainfall on the one hand, and of the mean
   number of rainfall events over any period of accumulation, on the other
   hand. This model is first applied to the analysis of monthly rainfall
   data over the whole of Niger. It is shown that the lasting drought which
   has affected Niger for more than 20 years is associated with a decrease
   in the number of rainy events, rather than to a decrease of the mean
   event rainfall, and that this decrease is more pronounced for the core
   of the rainy season. Because these fluctuations are not homogeneous over
   Niger, a 5 degrees x 4 degrees zone centred on the HAPEX-Sahel 1 degrees
   x 1 degrees square is selected in order to characterise more accurately
   the rainfall climatology of the HAPEX-Sahel area between 1950 and 1990.
   In comparison with what it was between 1950 and 1970, the average length
   of the rainy season has not changed significantly during the dry period
   1970-1990. Rather, it is the decrease of rainfall in July and August
   that explains most of the diminution of the total annual rainfall over
   this part of the Sahel since 1970. The average number of rainy events in
   August was reduced by about 30\%, while the mean event rainfall remained
   roughly constant. Finally, the analysis of the daily rainfall series for
   Niamey (which constitutes the longest record available in Niger,
   starting in 1905) enables the comparison of four periods of 20 years
   between 1910 and 1990. The period 1970-1989 appears to be by far the
   longest and most severe dry spell of the past century. Almost 90\% of
   the annual rainfall decrease over this period is explained by the
   decrease of the mean number of rainfall events during July and August,
   while both the length of the rainy season and the mean event rainfall
   remained stable.}},

Abstract = {{The HAPEX-Sahel experiment took place in the midst of the most severe
   drought that has ever plagued the region since rainfall records have
   been available in the Sahel, The aim of this paper is to describe the
   rainfall conditions that were observed during HAPEX-Sahel by a network
   of 100 recording raingauges, and to analyse them in the perspective of
   the long-term statistics at the Niamey station. Globally it is found
   that the average rainfall over the HAPEX-Sahel study area, as well as
   over Niger as a whole, during the experiment has been moderately (1991
   and 1992) to markedly dry (1990 and 1993), indicating that the drought
   of the past 20 years has not ended, More detailed statistics point to
   the high intermittency of the Sahelian rainfall, both in space (each
   year the ratio between the maximum and minimum recorded seasonal
   rainfall was of the order of 2) and in time (half the annual rain falls
   in 5 h). Particular attention is paid to the climatology of the rainy
   events. The point event rainfall is nearly exponentially distributed
   with a mean of about 14 mm, while the average areal event rainfall over
   the HAPEX-Sahel 1 degrees x 1 degrees square is of the order of 10.5 mm.
   The probability of zero rainfall is thus close to 1/4. Rain rates an
   often heavy, with half the annual rain falling at rain rates higher than
   35 mm h(-1) and one third of it falling at rain rates higher than 50 mm
   h(-1). The year to year statistics of both the event rainfall and the
   rain rates vary little, indicating that most of the inter-annual
   rainfall variability is due to the variation of the number of rainfall
   events, rather than to variations in rainfall intensities or in the mean
   event rainfall.}},

Abstract = {{The water and energy balance models that will be used in HAPEX-Sahel to
   analyze the data collected during the experiment are strongly
   conditioned by the rainfall estimation accuracy over the areas of
   interest. Following the description of the rainfall conditions that
   prevailed during HAPEX-Sahel and the computation of statistics
   characterising the point rainfall process for the Sahel, presented in a
   companion paper, it is examined here how accurate are the areal rainfall
   estimates provided by the EPSAT-Niger network at the event and seasonal
   scales, Using a geostatistical framework it is shown that it is possible
   to infer a climatological variogram that represents the average
   variability of the event rainfields, within the limits imposed by the
   resolution and sampling window of the network. Average event rainfall
   estimation errors are derived. The density of the EPSAT-Niger mesoscale
   network (one station for 150 km(2)) allows the estimation of the event
   areal rainfall over the 1 degrees x 1 degrees square with an average
   uncertainty around 5\%. On the supersites (100-750 km(2)) the average
   uncertainty can be as large as 20\%, depending on the site and rainfall
   considered. This uncertainty is reduced by two-thirds, or more, when
   using the denser network designed specifically to cover the supersites,
   It is then demonstrated how the variability within the event rainfields
   and the space-distribution of the rainy events combine to determine the
   spatial structure of a rainfield resulting from the accumulation of
   several event rainfields. Over the HAPEX-Sahel study area, the
   within-the-event-rainfield variability is dominant over the variability
   resulting from the distribution of the events in space. Consequently the
   correlation length does not vary much when shifting from the event to
   the seasonal scale. At an unsampled location the seasonal rainfall error
   magnitude is on the order of the average error at the event scale,
   divided by the square root of the number of events recorded during the
   season.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater level measurements taken over a 4-year period from an
   extensive network of wells and boreholes within the HAPEX-Sahel
   (Hydrologic Atmospheric Pilot Experiment in the Sahel) degree square
   (south Niger), together with existing data, have provided an insight
   into infiltration and recharge processes taking place in the porous
   phreatic aquifer of the Continental Terminal formation. Despite high
   spatial and temporal variability of aquifer response to rainfall (rises
   of between 0 and 9 m are recorded), a pattern of recharge can be
   recognised. Aquifer responses vary from site to site, but the type of
   response at any single point tends to be consistent from year to year.
   Recharge is dominated by infiltration from temporary drainage networks
   (pools and streams) and aquifer response depends to a large extent on
   aquifer hydraulic characteristics and distance from the nearest
   infiltrating zone. In many wells, for which data extending back to 1987
   is available, water levels show a consistent year by year rise. This is
   interpreted as a process of aquifer recovery following the severe
   drought of the 1970s and early 1980s, though part may also be
   attributable to changing patterns of land management (e.g. woodland
   clearance). Initial estimates of regional recharge are from 50-60 mm
   year(-1), or in other words about 10\% of annual rainfall. The figure is
   supported by other methods of investigation (hydrochemical analyses;
   water budgets of pools).}},

Abstract = {{An estimate of direct groundwater recharge below a region of natural
   woodland (tiger bush) has been made in south-west Niger using the solute
   profile technique. Data has been collected from a 77 m deep well dug
   within the study area covered by HAPEX-Sahel (Hydrological and
   Atmospheric Pilot Experiment), an international large-scale energy,
   water and carbon balance experiment carried out during the summer of
   1992. During well construction samples were taken from the unsaturated
   zone at the following intervals: every 25 cm from 0-10 m, every 50 cm
   from 10-62.5 m, then every metre to the bottom of the well. Pore water
   was extracted from each sample either by centrifugation or elutriation
   and analysed for chloride; moisture contents of samples were obtained
   gravimetrically. These data have been used to produce depth profiles of
   pore water chloride concentration and moisture content throughout the
   unsaturated zone. From these profiles it has been possible to derive an
   estimate of historic direct recharge at the site. The chloride
   concentration of rainfall, which is required to make the estimate, was
   determined from the analysis of 123 rainfall samples collected from five
   EPSAT (vers une Estimation des Precipitation par Satellite au sahel)
   rain gauges in 1992. A mean recharge rate of 13 mm year(-1) (range 10-19
   mm) is estimated for the upper 70 m of the profile, with a total
   residence time of 790 years (range 520-990 years). This is considered to
   be a representative estimate of the magnitude of direct recharge taking
   place below tiger bush areas.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrology of the Sahel is characterised by the degradation of the
   drainage network, resulting in the lack of large watersheds over which
   the spatial integration of the hydrological processes could be studied.
   The main hydrological units are small endoreic areas, measuring a few
   hectares to a few square kilometres and the surface runoff is collected
   into pools. A detailed investigation of the role of these pools in the
   hydrology of the HAPEX-Sahel Central Super-Site was carried out from
   1991 to 1993. The first results of this investigation are presented. A
   typology in three classes of the endoreic systems (valley bottoms;
   sinks; plateaux) is proposed. The behaviour of one representative pool
   in each class is analysed, showing that the partition between
   evaporation and deep infiltration depends on the level of filling of the
   pools, The bottom of the pool is clogged by clay deposits, which prevent
   infiltration. Above a threshold varying between 1 and 2 m most of the
   water stored in the poor after runoff infiltrates, contributing to the
   recharge of the aquifers. On a seasonal basis, deep infiltration
   accounts for less than 50\% of the water collected by the plateau pool,
   and more than 80\% for the valley bottom pools. Almost all the water
   running off to the sink pools infiltrates rapidly and deeply into the
   ground. The valley pools (both valley bottoms and sinks) appear to be
   the major contributors to the recharge of the upper aquifer, The
   proportion of the HAPEX-Sahel Central Super-Site water balance that is
   taken by the deep infiltration from the pools varies greatly depending
   on the temporal distribution of rainfall. Whereas similar seasonal
   rainfalls were recorded in 1991 and 1992, it is estimated that 5\% of
   the water precipitated over the valley pool watershed infiltrated
   towards the aquifer in 1991 and 20\% in 1992, This difference is
   explained by a very irregular time distribution of precipitation in
   1992, most of the major rainfall events being observed over a short
   period during the intensive observation period. In conclusion some
   preliminary figures are given regarding the importance of recharge from
   the pools as compared with in situ recharge.}},

Abstract = {{Within the scope of the HAPEX-Sahel experiment, the hydrological
   functioning of two small nested catchments was studied at two different
   scales: the plot scale (of the order of 100 m(2)) and the catchment
   scale (0.2 km(2)). At local scale, four runoff plots were set-up on the
   typical soil surface conditions observed on the catchments (plateau bare
   soil, two plots on fallow grassland) and an additional one was installed
   on a millet field. Soil moisture investigations at the plot scale have
   shown that infiltration was limited between 0.6 to 2 m deep on three
   sites, but was deeper than 3.4 m on the most pervious site (millet). The
   maximum water storage on all the sites was found to be reached at the
   maximum activity of the rainy season (late August), and not at the end
   of the season. During the dry months, the soil was fully dried off by
   evapotranspiration, resulting in the absence of inter-annual soil water
   storage. No influence of vegetation cover on runoff was observed on the
   fallow sites, but runoff generation was found to be very sensitive to
   tillage on the millet field. The parameter P-u, calculated from a
   rainfall hyetograph and defined as the rainfall depth that can actually
   produce runoff, is shown to be relevant to compute runoff on untilled
   soils, as it explains more than 87\% of the variance in runoff depth. On
   tilled soils, it is necessary to take into account additionally the
   temporal evolution of the soil surface, especially the days after
   weeding operations. Simple linear relationships were derived to compute
   runoff depth from P-u on the plots for the most typical soil moisture
   conditions observed, and modified SCS equations have been derived for
   the catchments. Using the linear equations derived at the plot scale in
   a simple, empirical, semi-distributed model lead to formulate the
   assumption that the partial source area concept applied on the
   catchments. Analysis of discharge data at the catchment scale highlights
   that seepage through the bottom of a gully between two gauging stations
   leads to the abstraction of non negligible volumes of water. Moreover,
   the water totally infiltrates in a spreading zone downstream from the
   outlet of the largest catchment showing that discontinuities occur in
   the surface water transmission within a catena. Such discontinuities
   constitute a major problem for the concern of aggregation of hydrologic
   precesses. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Although soil crusting has long been recognized as a crucial runoff
   factor in the Sahel, very few field methods have been developed for the
   measurement of the crust hydraulic conductivity, which is difficult to
   achieve because of the small thickness of most surface crusts. A field
   method, based on the simultaneous use of disc infiltrometers and
   minitensiometers is proposed for determining the crust hydraulic
   conductivity and sorptivity near saturation. On crusted soils, the
   classical analysis of the steady state water how was found to be
   inadequate. The proposed method is based on sorptivity measurements
   performed at different water supply potentials and uses recent
   developments of transient flow analysis. A minitensiometer, placed
   horizontally at the crust-subsoil interface, facilitated the analysis of
   the infiltration regime for the crust solely.
   Results are shown for representative soil units of the East Central
   Super Site of the HAPEX-Sahel experiment: fallow grasslands, millet
   fields and tiger bush. Non-crusted soils were also considered and
   validated the transient method as demonstrated by comparison with
   Wooding's steady state solution. This validation was obtained in the
   case of fallow grasslands soil but not for the millet fields. In this
   latter case, the persistent effects of localized working of the soil to
   remove weeds caused large variations in infiltration fluxes between the
   sampling points, which tended to dominate over effects of differences in
   applied potential. For the tiger bush crusted soils, the ratio of the
   saturated hydraulic conductivity of the crust to that of the underlying
   soil ranges from 1/3 to 1/6, depending on whether the crust is of a
   structural (ST) or sedimentation (SED) type. The method also allows the
   estimation of a functional mean pore size, consistent with laboratory
   measurements, and 40\% less for the crusts in comparison with the
   underlying soil.
   The results obtained here will be used in hydrological models to predict
   the partition of rainfall between infiltration and runoff.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes measurements made at each sits and for each
   vegetation cover as part of the soils program for the HAPEX-Sahel
   regional scale experiment. The measurements were based on an initial
   sampling scheme and included profile soil water content, surface soil
   water content, soil water potential. infiltration rates. additional
   measurements on core samples, and grain size analysis. The measurements
   were used to categorize the state of the surface and profile soil water
   regimes during the experiment and to derive functional relationships for
   the soil water characteristic curve, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity
   function, and infiltration function. Sample results for different
   supersites and different vegetation covers are presented showing soil
   water profiles and total soil water storage on days corresponding to the
   experimental `Golden Days'. Sample results are also presented for
   spatial and temporal distribution of surface moisture content and
   infiltration tests. The results demonstrate that the major experimental
   objective of monitoring the supersites during the most rapid vegetative
   growth stage with the largest change of the surface energy balance
   following the rainy season was very nearly achieved. Separation of the
   effects of probable root activity and drainage of the soil profile is
   possible. The potential for localized advection between the bare soil
   and vegetation strips of the tiger bush sites is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{During rain there can be substantial redistribution of water at the
   surface of sandy soils in the Sudano-Sahelian zone, because of localised
   runoff and runon. This results in variable infiltration over a field.
   Measurements of spatial variability in infiltration and crop growth were
   made in a millet field at the southern supersite of the HAPEX-Sahel
   experiment in Niger. Infiltration was calculated from the change in sail
   water storage measured using a neutron probe at up to 33 locations,
   before and after rain storms exceeding 10 mm. Data were obtained for
   five storms in 1993 and 1994, Infiltration varied from 0.3 to 3.4 times
   the recorded rainfall, though more than 80\% of the locations had
   infiltration between 0.6 and 1.2 times the recorded rainfall. There was
   some consistency between storms, with locations at the extremes of
   infiltration having consistently high or low infiltration. The amount of
   infiltration had little discernable influence on crop growth, other than
   possibly at the very dry and very wet sites, where growth was reduced.
   The soil water balance model, SWIM, was used to assess the consequences
   of variable infiltration and crop growth on the partitioning of water
   losses between evaporation and drainage in 1992. Simulation of variable
   infiltration suggested that it has relatively little effect on
   evaporation, but considerable effect on point drainage. Once there was
   sufficient infiltration to cause drainage (which was achieved in all but
   extreme runoff areas), there was a linear relationship between any
   further cumulative infiltration and the annual loss through drainage,
   with typically more than 70\% of any further input being lost as
   drainage. This linear relationship meant that on a held scale, variable
   infiltration had minimal effect on drainage, with increased drainage
   from runon areas tending to be at the expense of reduced drainage from
   runoff areas.}},

Abstract = {{Airborne microwave radiometric measurements in the framework of the
   HAPEX-Sahel Experiment were performed by the Push Broom Microwave
   Radiometer (PBMR) and the PORTOS radiometer. The flights of both
   radiometers produced an original set of data covering the 1.4-90 GHz
   range of frequency. The East and West Central Super Sites were the areas
   most intensively observed by the microwave radiometers. Over those
   sites, several brightness temperature (T-B) maps are available at seven
   dates distributed over a 1 month period in the middle of the rainy
   season. A comparison of the two radiometers demonstrates their
   radiometric quality and the precision of the localization of the
   microwave observations. At 1.4 GHz, the vegetation had very little
   effect on the soil microwave emission. Maps of soil moisture were
   developed using a single linear relationship between T-B and the surface
   soil moisture. There is an important spatial heterogeneity in the soil
   moisture distribution, which is explained by both the soil moisture
   hydrodynamic properties and the localization of the precipitation
   fields. At 5.05 GHz, the vegetation must be accounted for to infer soil
   moisture from the microwave observations. A method based on a simple
   radiative transfer model and on microwave data has shown encouraging
   results. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Terrain characteristics such as roughness and vegetation have been shown
   to significantly affect the interpretation of microwave brightness
   temperatures (TBS) for mapping soil moisture. This study, a part of the
   1992 HAPEX-Sahel experiment (Hydrologic Atmospheric pilot Experiment in
   the Sahel). aimed to determine the effects of laterite and associated
   terrain components (i.e. vegetation, soil, and exposed water bodies) on
   the Ts response of the Pushbroom Microwave Radiometer (PBMR, L-band, 21
   cm wavelength), using the NS001 Thematic Mapper Simulator data as a
   surrogate for ground data. Coincident PBMR and NS001 data acquired from
   the high altitude (about 1500 m) long transect flights were processed to
   obtain TBS and radiances, respectively. The transects covered a range of
   moisture conditions. For this preliminary evaluation, no atmospheric
   corrections were applied, and the data sets were aligned by matching the
   acquisition times of the data records. NS001 pixels (about 3 m) were
   averaged to approximate the resolution of the PBMR (about 450 m), before
   their flight line data were compared. The laterite plateaux were found
   to have a surprisingly strong effect on the PBMR T-B response. T-B
   variations along the flight line could largely be explained by a
   combination of density and dielectric properties of laterite. The effect
   of surface moisture was distinguishable from the laterite effect, with
   the distinction apparently related to the occurrence of ephemeral pools
   of water after rainfall. Model simulated TBS agreed reasonably well with
   the observed TBS.}},

Abstract = {{An algorithm to simultaneously retrieve land surface temperatures and
   spectral emissivities in the microwave spectrum for applications with
   SSM/I measurements is developed and tested over the HAPEX-Sahel region.
   A closed but overspecified system of radiative transfer equations,
   written in terms of unknown surface temperatures and unpolarized
   spectral emissivities at 19, 37, and 85 GHz, is solved with a non-linear
   least-squares optimization technique. Clear-sky multispectral SSM/I
   brightness temperature measurements at full resolution pixel scale,
   obtained at least twice during a diurnal cycle (corresponding to the
   ascending and descending nodes of a DMSP satellite orbit), are used as
   input over a target area. It is assumed that the spectral emissivities
   remain constant during the rime period under consideration.
   High-resolution temperature-moisture profiles obtained from the Meteo
   France-CNRM balloon-launch station sited at Hamdallay are used to help
   account for atmospheric effects in the radiative calculations. Retrieved
   surface temperatures are consistent with ground-based radiometer skin
   temperature measurements and in situ soil temperature measurements
   obtained during the 1992 Intensive Observing Period (IOP) at the
   West-Central supersite for the 8 October golden day case. Qualitative
   agreement is also found with split window surface temperature estimates
   retrieved from AVHRR satellite measurements, although this cannot be
   considered a rigorous verification procedure because of uncertainties in
   the IR technique and dissimilar overpass times between DMSP and NOAA
   satellites. The microwave emissivity estimates are consistent with
   results reported in the published literature. The algorithm is applied
   over an extended North African region surrounding the HAPEX-Sahel study
   area for an ensemble of golden days to illustrate its potential for
   large-scale applications. As an independent test of its utility, output
   from the algorithm is used over the study area in conjunction with a
   physically based precipitation retrieval algorithm which requires
   representative estimates of surface temperature and emissivity in the
   forward radiative transfer model calculations. This test is successful
   in that rain events are correctly identified and their intensity is
   accurately retrieved in the course of the 1992 IOP, demonstrating the
   value of a simultaneous temperature-emissivity algorithm in aiding other
   types of terrestrial remote sensing schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to use the information provided by the ERS-1
   wind scatterometer (WSC) over land surfaces in arid and semi-arid
   environments to infer soil moisture in the presence of vegetation.
   Driven by dielectric properties and surface roughness, the soil
   contribution is attenuated by a factor which depends on canopy
   characteristics (water content, shape, height, density) and
   scatterometer viewing conditions. To describe the influence of
   vegetation on the signal, a semiempirical `water-cloud' model (a
   first-order radiative transfer solution) was used. The optical thickness
   (tau) and the single scattering albedo (omega) are the parameters used
   to quantify vegetation contribution to the measured signal. Through a
   simulation analysis for different soil moisture and viewing (incidence
   angle) conditions, we show the importance of tau and omega on the signal
   partition between vegetation and soil contributions. To quantify the
   effect of vegetation on the signal, we used information on the green
   vegetation acquired from NOAA-AVHRR, visible and near-IR data combined
   with WSC satellite data in a water-cloud model to extract tau and omega.
   The temporal evolution of the various contributions to the signal was
   then compared for different angular ranges. This semiempirical model was
   then applied within suitable angular ranges to retrieve soil moisture.}},

Abstract = {{The variation in evaporative fraction and actual evaporation is examined
   for three sample days in the HAPEX-Sahel Intensive Observation Period
   (IOP), including data from all the vegetation types and sites. The
   trends in evaporative fraction over the IOP are also presented for eight
   sites. The high rate of evaporation from bare soil in the days following
   rainfall produces a variability in evaporation which makes differences
   between sites difficult to interpret on a day-to-day basis, but over the
   whole IOP it is shown that the millet uses a smaller proportion of the
   available energy for evaporation than the tiger bush or fallow savannah.
   The combined effect of differences in the total energy used and its
   partitioning into evaporation and sensible heat flux is demonstrated
   from the trends in cumulative total energy use and evaporation at the
   three southern sites, where it is shown that there is systematically
   less evaporation from the millet than from the savannah or tiger bush
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{The variability between surface flux measurements at the fallow sites of
   the three HAPEX-Sahel supersites is examined over periods of three or
   four consecutive days, A roving eddy correlation instrument provided a
   common base for comparison at each supersite. The inhomogeneity of the
   surface and the instrumental layout did not provide the conditions to
   allow the separation of the effects of instrument error from those due
   to the spatial variability of vegetation cover and soil moisture.
   Surface fluxes of sensible and latent heat and energy balance terms were
   intercompared at each supersite over summation timescales of 1 hour and
   3 days, It is shown that, generally, HAPEX-Sahel hourly sensible heat
   flux and latent heat values have confidence limits of 15\% and 20\%
   respectively. The three-day period energy balance shows the combined
   sensible and latent heat fluxes to have a confidence limit of 3\%. It is
   concluded that, due to the averaging effect of longer time periods and
   larger flux footprints on spatial inhomogeneity, confidence in the
   surface Bur measurements increases with longer summation periods and
   with neutral atmospheric surface layers which characterise the rainy
   period of the Intensive Observation Period.}},

Abstract = {{A previous study of evaporation from an area of patterned woodland
   (tiger-bush) in Niger by Gulf et al. (1993) has demonstrated the need to
   determine the contribution from the bare soil strips which occupy 67\%
   of the surface area. They measured total evaporation from the entire
   land surface using eddy correlation, but not the individual
   contributions from the soil and vegetation components. This distinction
   is necessary to create accurate models of evaporation from the
   tiger-bush as different processes operate in the two components. The
   previous study in the same area relied upon untested modelling of the
   bare soil evaporation as no direct measurements were available. In the
   present study, carried out during HAPEX-Sahel, hourly fluxes of
   evaporation from a large patch of bare soil within the tiger-bush were
   measured using a Bowen ratio system. The data obtained show in derail
   how soil evaporation varies after rainfall as the surface dried out.
   Comparison is made on an hourly and daily basis of actual and potential
   evaporation. A two-phase model based on the Ritchie (1972) approach is
   calibrated using these data and the model is used to calculate the soil
   evaporation component of the water balance over a number of seasons with
   different rainfall. This analysis shows that over the entire tiger-bush
   area, annual soil evaporation is normally similar to 28\% of annual
   rainfall, but this percentage increases markedly in dry years. The
   implications are that in dry years runoff from these bare soil areas
   will decrease by a greater percentage than rainfall because a greater
   proportion of rainfall is lost as soil evaporation.}},

Abstract = {{For various purposes and applications it is convenient to have a simple
   technique available that produces reliable estimates about the
   contribution of the soil sensible and latent heat of a crop canopy or
   natural vegetation to the total fluxes. This is especially of importance
   in the case of a sparse vegetation where the bare soil is the major
   component.
   Under low wind conditions a free convective state often occurs which
   offers an opportunity to make a simple assessment of the soil sensible
   heat contribution to the total sensible heat flux. In this case there
   exists a unique relation between the surface Rayleigh number and the
   surface Nusselt number. The same technique can be applied to the vapour
   flux by using a unique relation between the surface Rayleigh number and
   the surface Sherwood number, if the soil surface is wet. The last
   condition occurs after a rainy period. Mostly, however, the upper soil
   layer is dry and the soil evaporation will be limited by the surface
   resistance to evaporation. If the relation between soil moisture and the
   so-called `soil Bowen ratio coefficient', c(w), as proposed by Massman
   (1992) is known, a simple correction to the potential soil evaporation
   can be applied.
   During the HAPEX-Sahel experiment the above-mentioned technique has been
   applied to a natural vegetation under semi-arid conditions. Moreover,
   the modelled soil evaporation has been verified by micro-lysimeter data.
   It appeared that the proposed technique is promising and is in agreement
   with the measurement results.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented for calculating conductive heat flux at the soil
   surface (Go) from measured soil heat flux (G) some centimetres beneath
   the ground surface. The method does not require estimation of thermal
   properties and is valid for inhomogeneous soils with regard to their
   thermal properties. Data from the central sub-site of the Eastern Super
   Site of the HAPEX-Sahel experiment are used to illustrate the method.
   Finally, the influence of using corrected values of surface soil heat
   flux G(0), rather than measured values of G, in the energy budget with
   the Bowen ratio is evaluated. The corrections for G are small in the
   case of the highly diffusive soil of the Sahel. Errors in estimating
   latent heat flux with G instead of G(0) are negligible. However,
   calculations show that these errors could be much more important for
   other soils with lower soil thermal diffusivity. (C) 1997 Elsevier

   the concentration of stable isotopes of water. The sampling took place
   at the beginning of the wet season. The stable isotope compositions, in
   conjunction with other physical measurements, were used to determine the
   mixing of rainfall with soil water, the point of extraction of water
   from the soil profile by the vegetation, and the relative importance of
   transpiration and evaporation from the soil surface. In the sandy soils
   of the area, water infiltration from rainfall into the upper parts of
   the soil profile was rapid. The perennial vegetation of the area. Guiera
   senegalensis, extracted the water from shallow depths of the soil
   profile, consistent with its extensive superficial root system. The
   transpiration from these plants contributed only about 20\% of the total

Abstract = {{The behaviour of evaporation. sensible heat and canopy conductance of
   fallow savannah and patterned woodland in the Sahel is studied for the
   HAPEX-Sahel Intensive observation Period. Both fallow savannah and
   patterned woodland reach evaporation rates of 4-5 mm day(-1) during the
   rainy part of the IOP and show a decline, after the rains have ceased,
   to 2 mm day(-1). Sensible heat fluxes are different for the two
   vegetation types. This is also reflected in the behaviour of the
   evaporative fraction. analysis of the vegetation surface conductance of
   the vegetation part shows that maximum values for fallow savannah are
   around 10 mm s(-1), and for patterned woodland up to 40 mm s(-1). The
   response of the conductance to vapour pressure deficit is different for
   the two vegetation types. This is attributed to differences in C-3 and
   C-4 species composition. The consequences of these differences for
   modelling vegetation-atmosphere interaction in the semi-arid tropics are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The HAPEX-Sahel experiment was organized to investigate the impact of
   water, energy and CO2 fluxes at the soil-vegetation-atmosphere interface
   on climate processes in the Sahelian region, Measurements of the energy
   balance components, CO2 flux and soil moisture were conducted over a
   savanna area at the East Central Supersite of the one degree square
   during a 3 month period in 1992. The aim of this particular
   investigation was to understand the role of surface conditions (i.e.
   vegetation and moisture) in the partitioning of available energy at the
   surface into sensible and latent heat flux. It also aimed to improve the
   understanding of how water and carbon cycles are affected by vegetation
   functioning, soil water availability and atmospheric demand. The
   analysis presented in this paper showed that the relative contribution
   of the soil and the vegetation to latent heat flux varies intimately
   with the temporal rainfall distribution and the growth of the savanna
   grass species, which is more sensitive to the distribution of
   precipitation than to its amount. Finally, semi-empirical
   parameterizations were developed to formulate (1) the daily
   evapotranspiration rate of the savanna in terms of available energy at
   the surface and soil water content, and (2) the instantaneous carbon
   uptake in terms of photosynthetically active radiation received at the
   surface and soil water availability.}},

Title = {{Stomatal conductance of west-central supersite vegetation in
   HAPEX-Sahel: Measurements and empirical models}},

Abstract = {{Empirical relationships were derived to describe the climatic control of
   stomatal conductance for four of the most common species of the
   HAPEX-Sahel study area. These species included a Ct shrub (Guiera
   senegalensis), a C-3 forb (Mitracarpus scaber), a C-4 grass (Digitario
   gayanus) and the most common crop of the area, millet (Pennisetum
   glaucum), which is also a C, species. For all four species the
   controlling climate variables were photosynthetically active radiation
   (PAR), vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and soil water potential, and their
   responses to these variables differed in a manner that was consistent
   with their different photosynthetic physiologies. Air temperature was
   not found to be a significant variable.
   Canopy average stomatal conductances ((g) over bar(s)) were estimated
   from leaf-level measurements and then modelled in this paper. By
   relating the distribution of leaf-level stomatal conductances to light
   attenuation through the canopy it was shown that total PAR intercepted
   by the canopy, divided by leaf area index (LAI) (i.e. average PAR
   interception), can be used to estimate (g) over bar(s) to a good
   approximation of the non-linear canopy integral as long as LAI variation
   in the measurements is small (e.g. less than 1.0). This assumes that the
   other environmental variables are constant through the canopy, but is
   significant in that it simplifies the procedure for the estimation of
   (g) over bar(s) and canopy conductance (g(c)).
   The values of (g) over bar(s) were limited by PAR availability for brief
   periods at sunrise and sunset and, for the two C-4 species, there was
   evidence that shading within the canopy reduced the average values.
   However, the strongest diurnal variation was correlated with the
   increase in VPD, associated with increasing air temperature, which
   resulted in decreasing conductances during most of the day, following
   the peak in the early morning. The long-term decline in stomatal
   conductances following the last rainfall was associated with
   increasingly negative soil water potential. G. senegalensis retained its
   leaves through December with low but measurable stomatal conductances.
   Canopy conductances (g(c)) were estimated from (g) over bar(s) and leaf
   area. Maximum values of g(c) occurred near the end of the rains, when
   environmental conditions were still near optimum and LAI was high.}},

Abstract = {{Micrometeorological measurements of the surface flux of carbon dioxide
   were made at a number of spatially separate sites within the HAPEX-Sahel

   by differences in rainfall (both quantity and frequency) over the
   experimental area exert a major influence on the absolute magnitude of
   the surface flux of carbon made simultaneously over the experimental
   area. Surface fluxes are presented for the three major types of
   vegetation in the Sahelian landscape, namely, millet, savannah and tiger
   bush. The atmospheric and surface controls on the surface flux of CO2
   are described for these three land surfaces and the fluxes are compared
   between sites. The comparison shows that modellers need to take into
   account the heterogeneity not only of the type of surface vegetation but
   also the variability in the life cycle stage of the vegetation, when
   scaling up to larger areas.}},

Abstract = {{An eddy covariance system is described which has been developed jointly
   at a number of European laboratories and which was used widely in
   HAPEX-Sahel. The system uses commercially available instrumentation: a
   three-axis sonic anemometer and an IR gas analyser which is used in a
   closed-path mode, i.e. air is brought to the optical bench by being
   ducted down a sampling tube from a point near the sonic anemometer. The
   system is controlled by specially written software which calculates the
   surface fluxes of momentum, sensible and latent heat and carbon dioxide,
   and displays them in real time. The raw turbulent records can be stored
   for post-processing. Up to five additional analogue instruments can be
   sampled at up to 10 Hz and digitised by the sonic anemometer. The
   instruments are described and details of their operation and connection
   are presented. The system has relatively low power consumption and can
   operate from appropriate solar cells or rechargeable batteries.
   Calibration of the gas analyser needs to be performed typically every 2
   or 3 days, and, given that the system requires minimal maintenance and
   is weather insensitive, it can be operated for the routine collection of
   surface flux data for extended periods. There are a number of
   corrections which have to be applied in any eddy covariance system and
   we describe the system of transfer functions which define our system.
   Some representative results showing the potential of the system are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of canopy and leaf scale CO2 flux from the three sub-sites
   at the HAPEX-Sahel Southern supersite are presented. These are analysed
   in relation to biological and environmental variables. At leaf scale,
   the flux is most strongly influenced by photosynthetic photon flux
   density (PPFD) and stomatal conductance. Together with measurements of
   canopy structure at each site, the measurements of leaf photosynthesis,
   stomatal conductance and stem respiration were used to parameterise
   sub-models within the canopy model MAESTRO, which predicts canopy net
   CO2 flux. Comparison of the independent canopy flux measurements with
   predictions is informative. as the model represents an integration of
   our knowledge of the system, and so differences highlight weak points in
   our understanding as well as measurement artefacts. These differences
   are largest in tiger bush and smallest in millet, and are attributed to
   the effect of canopy heterogeneity on measurements rather than
   biological processes. Generally, good agreement was found at all three
   sites and the model can be regarded as validated. The model was used to
   extrapolate measurements in time, and, using a year's weather data,
   predicted a value for carbon sequestration at the millet site over the
   growing season very close to harvest measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Within the framework of the HAPEX-Sahel experiment carried out in Niger
   during the rainy season of 1992, measurements of fluxes defining the
   vegetation-atmosphere interaction were conducted over a millet field,
   for a period of nearly 2 months. These measurements comprised continuous
   recording of solar radiation, atmospheric carbon dioxide fluxes using
   the eddy correlation technique, and sap flow through millet plants.
   Based on biometric measurements of the millet plants comprising height,
   spacing and leaf area index, the solar radiation is converted to
   absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (aPAR). The coupling
   between the three parameters is examined in pairs. The diurnal and
   seasonal variations are analysed in relation to plant development. A
   strong linear relationship between aPAR and carbon dioxide assimilation
   can be established from the measurements, giving a quantum yield of 0.03
   mol CO2 mol(-1) quanta. A comparison between CO2 flux and transpiration
   shows that this relationship is affected by the water vapour pressure
   deficit of the atmosphere, but corresponds to the results found for
   other drought-tolerant C-4 crops.}},

Abstract = {{Canopy stale vegetation net production of four canopies of the
   HAPEX-Sahel west central supersite was modelled using two contrasting
   models of photosynthesis. The vegetation canopies included the Guiera
   senegalensis shrubs of the shrub fallow site, the herb layers of the
   shrub fallow and grass fallow sites and the millet crop. The two models
   were based on (i) the production efficiency approach, which assumes that
   light is the primary limiting factor, and (ii) the CO2 supply function
   approach, which assumes that the rate of CO2 influx to the leaves is the
   main limiting factor. The models were generalised to apply across
   vegetation types and through time by allowing important parameters to
   vary according to the proportion of C-3 plants in the canopy, by
   addition of maintenance and growth respiration terms and by addition of
   an empirical term related to leaf age. The models were driven using
   ground measurements of the biophysical variables (light interception,
   leaf area index, stomatal and canopy conductances) summed or averaged to
   the ten-day temporal scale and fitted to harvest estimates of ten-day
   net production. Each term of the overall models was tested for
   statistical significance during the model fitting procedure,
   Despite their opposing assumptions, both models were able to explain a
   large proportion (>80\%) of the total variance in ten-day net production
   in the four canopies during the growing season. This was attributed in
   part to the fact that both models are dependent on the assessment of
   canopy amount (represented by light interception and LAI, respectively)
   which are correlated, and because the functions describing the effect of
   environmental variables (soil moisture, vapour pressure deficit) on
   photosynthesis were also correlated. Inclusion of the maintenance
   respiration term was statistically significant for both modelling
   approaches. Leaf age was significant in most cases but this may be
   related to the covariance of the day of the year with environmental
   parameters. In most cases significant differences in the average values
   of maximum PAR conversion efficiency (epsilon{*}) and CO2 concentration
   gradient (Delta) were found between C-3 and C-4 species. However. the
   values of epsilon{*} and Delta do not agree with expected or literature
   estimates of these values. This suggests that the assumptions of neither
   model were entirely correct and implies that a calibration step is
   required for their application.}},

Abstract = {{Canopy PAR interception (IPAR) is an important variable in many models
   of canopy photosynthesis and net primary production. IPAR can be
   estimated remotely using spectral vegetation indices (VI). However, IPAR
   estimates by this method are subject to errors (E) associated with (i)
   the estimation of fractional interception (f(PAR)) from a VI measurement
   (E-F), (ii) the accuracy of estimates of incident PAR (E-T) and (iii)
   the interaction of these errors (E-X). During the HAPEX-Sahel experiment
   in Niger in 1991 the temporal evolution of a VI was measured over the
   study sites with a radiometer mounted in a light aircraft. Ground
   measurements of f(PAR) and incident PAB on HAPEX West Central shrub
   fallow, grass fallow, degraded shrub fallow and millet sites were
   available. The f(PAR) measurements were used to determine the
   relationship between the VI and fractional interception. The aircraft
   measurements were then used. together with remote estimates of incident
   PAR from the TOMS satellite. to estimate IPAR through the season and to
   quantify the error sources. Both E-F and E-T can result in large
   absolute and relative errors in IPAR estimates, E-X was generally small.
   In ten-day summations on the shrub and grass fallow sites, the total
   errors were mostly less than 20\% of the round measurements. On the
   millet and degraded shrub fallow, the ten-day errors were more
   substantial. The errors at short time steps (1-10 days) cancel when
   summed for the whole growing season.
   In applications where the precise daily errors in IPAR estimates cannot
   be quantified, the statistical uncertainty of the estimates can be
   evaluated if the uncertainty in the input variables is known. The
   standard error of IPAR estimates is then dependent on the residual
   variance in the regression between vegetation index and f(PAR) and on
   the mean square error of the remote estimates of incident PAR.}},

Abstract = {{Linear mixture models have been used to invert spectral reflectances of
   targets at the Earth's surface into proportions of plant and soil
   components. However, operational use of mixture models has been limited
   by a lack of biophysical interpretation of the results. The main
   objectives of this study were (I) to relate the deconvolved components
   of a mixture model with biophysical properties of vegetation and soil at
   the surface and (2) to apply the mixture model results to remotely
   sensed imagery. A radiative transfer model (SAIL: Scattering by
   Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves) was used to generate reflectance `mixtures'
   from leaf and bare soil spectral measurements made at HAPEX-Sahel
   (Hydrological Atmospheric Pilot EXperiment) study sites, The SAIL model
   was used to create canopy reflectances and fractions of absorbed
   photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) for a range of mixed targets
   with varying leaf area index (LAI) and soils. A spectral mixture model
   was used to deconvolve the simulated reflectance data into component
   fractions, which were then calibrated to the SAIL-generated LAI, fAPAR
   and soil brightness. The calibrated relationships were validated with
   observational ground data (LAI, fAPAR and reflectance) measured at the
   HAPEX Sahel fallow bush/grassland, fallow grassland and millet sites.
   Both the vegetation and soil component fractions were found to be
   dependent upon soil background brightness, such that inclusion of the
   soil fraction information significantly improved the derivation of
   vegetation biophysical parameters. Soil brightness was also shown to be
   a useful parameter to infer soil properties. The deconvolution
   methodology was then applied to a nadir image of a HAPEX-Sahel site
   measured by the Advanced Solid State Array Spectroradiometer (ASAS).
   Site LAI and fAPAR were successfully estimated by combining the
   fractional estimates of vegetation and soils. obtained through
   deconvolution of the ASAS image, with the calibrated relationships
   between vegetation fraction,LAI and fAPAR, obtained from the SAIL data.}},

Abstract = {{The study presents a model of top of the atmosphere (TOA) and surface
   reflectances in the visible and near-IR. The reflectance is
   parameterized as the product of an isotropic component (constant) of the
   reflection and normalized temporal and bidirectional functions. The
   bidirectional function uses a simple physical representation of viewing
   geometry. The temporal function is represented as a development in
   modified Fourier series. An iterative scheme is used to adjust the
   constants of the model. The analysis is applied to three locations
   consisting of 15 x 15 NOAA-AVHRR pixels acquired in 1992 during the
   HAPEX-Sahel experiment (Niger). Clouds were screened using a threshold
   standard deviation of reflectance (visible) and mean brightness
   temperature (thermal Channel 4). The study allowed the highest frequency
   fluctuations in the dataset to be reduced substantially (about 85\% of
   the variance is explained) and allowed the temporal variation of the
   land surface cover to be detected. Comparisons between results obtained
   with TOA and atmospherically corrected surface reflectances show that
   there is a need to improve the monitoring of aerosols; however, the
   angular effects were the largest contributors to high-frequency
   fluctuations in the NOAA-AVHRR data.}},

   Inversion of two BRDF models against multiple angle ASAS images}},

Abstract = {{The provision of spatially and temporally disaggregated values of albedo
   is critical to an improved understanding of energy interactions at the
   Earth surface. Remotely sensed estimates of land surface albedo can best
   be obtained by inverting models of the Bidirectional Reflectance
   Distribution Function (BRDF) against bidirectional reflectance factor
   measurements sampled at different sensor view angles and solar
   illumination angles. This paper describes the preliminary results
   obtained using such an approach over the HAPEX-Sahel (Hydrological and
   Atmospheric Pilot Experiment) southern super-site in Niger. Two BRDF
   models, one empirical (modified-Walthall) and one semi-empirical (a
   linear kernel-driven model, employing isotropic, geometric and volume
   scattering kernels), are inverted analytically against each pixel in a
   set of co-registered multispectral images acquired by NASA's Advanced
   Solid-state Array Spectroradiometer (ASAS). The paper describes the
   methods used to register these images to sub-pixel accuracy, to perform
   radiometric and first-order atmospheric correction of the data, and to
   invert the BRDF model against the pre-processed image data to yield
   spatially referenced estimates of the model parameters and angularly
   integrated terms related to albedo. Spatial patterns, closely related to
   variations in land cover type, are clearly evident in these data. It is
   shown that, in this instance, the simple empirical model provides a
   better fit to the measured data, particularly at red and near-infrared
   wavelengths. The poorer performance of the semi-empirical model at this
   particular study site is discussed in terms of the assumptions that the
   model makes about energy interaction with the land surface. The impacts
   of changes in the projected instantaneous field-of-view as a function of
   sensor view angle and of residual image-to-image mis-registration on the
   derived BRDF model parameters and estimated albedo values are also
   examined.}},

   processes. Remotely sensed spectral data provide powerful means to
   characterize vegetation state. In this study, we investigate the
   opportunities of such data when an automatic classification is applied
   to time-series of remotely sensed data. The analysis is then conducted
   by interpreting the classification results in terms of surface physical
   parameters. The method consists in (1) selecting several control points
   in the HAPEX-Sahel square degree, during the rainy season of 1991 and
   1992, and (2) comparing the temporal evolution of the albedo-based
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values and those deriving
   from the classification. The result shows that there is similarity
   between the behaviour of the 1991 and 1992 temporal profiles estimated
   at all control points.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of land surface temperature can be regarded as an
   important prerequisite of the global or regional monitoring of water,
   energy, and radiation budgets. An accurate estimation of land surface
   temperature involves correction for both the atmospheric and the surface
   emissivity effect. Combined ground truth, radiosonde and remote sensing
   data from the HAPEX-Sahel experiment have been used to evaluate three
   existing AVHRR-based split-window models designed for land surface
   temperature estimation and an algorithm for emissivity difference
   estimation. Local or regional model coefficients have been determined on
   the basis of simulated AVHRR measurements. The applied model for the
   emissivity difference determination turned out to be very sensitive
   under situations with medium to high water vapour content. It was found
   that results from the three models compared well except at large view
   angles. In semi-arid regions with high atmospheric water vapour content
   the atmospheric effect accounts for almost 90\% of the correction
   whereas the emissivity effect typically accounts for 10\%. An absolute
   evaluation was not performed, but comparison with ground truth data
   showed that the model-predicted temperatures were well within the
   expected range.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating the sensible heat flux H over sparse vegetation from thermal
   infrared temperature requires an estimate of the excess resistance r(r)
   to the aerodynamic resistance. This excess resistance has been commonly
   expressed as a function of the dimensionless parameter kB(-1).
   Experimental analysis of this parameter over diverse sparse vegetation
   in semi-arid areas showed a large and unexpected range of variation. The
   flux and ground-based thermal infrared data of the East Central Site of
   HAPEX-Sahel were used in this paper to study the behaviour of the kB(-1)
   parameter and to compare these results with the conclusions of previous
   studies. At first, the global accuracy of the; estimation of H as a
   function of the kB(-1) value was analysed; it was found that
   overestimating kB has less serious consequences than underestimating it.
   Then, optimal values of kB(-1), obtained for each site (one fallow
   savannah site and two millet sites), ranged from 5.1 to 10.2, with
   significantly different values for the two millet sites. The
   corresponding Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between estimated and
   measured H ranged from 43 to 67 W m(-2). Finally, the instantaneous
   Values of kB(-1) proved to be highly variable and the parameterization
   of kB(-1) proposed by Kustas et al. (1989) as a function of u(T-r - T-a)
   appeared valid only for high H values. For lower values, the slope of
   this relationship must be adjusted for each class of H. All the previous
   results confirmed that a constant value can neither be assumed for
   semi-arid areas nor for a given type of vegetation and that further
   studies are needed to understand its behaviour. Considering the
   difficulty in predicting the kB(-1) values, a different approach based
   on the relationship observed between aerodynamic and radiometric
   temperatures was investigated. This approach gave more accurate estimate
   of H (RMSE between 35 and 48 W m(-2)), but remains at this stage purely
   empirical. Further investigation is now needed to predict the
   parameterization of this approach.}},

Abstract = {{To estimate sensible heat flux from radiometric surface temperature over
   sparse vegetation, it is necessary to add an excess resistance to the
   aerodynamic resistance calculated between the canopy source height and
   the reference height. This excess resistance is classically expressed as
   a function of the kB(-1) parameter. By using the Shuttleworth-Wallace
   two-layer model, together with the linearity hypothesis on radiometric
   temperature, an analytical expression of the kB(-1) parameter has been
   obtained. This expression and the numerical simulations show that kB(-1)
   is not a constant parameter: it varies as a function of the structural
   characteristics of the vegetation, the level of water stress and the
   climatic conditions. The model predictions have been confronted with
   experimental data, obtained on a fallow savannah during HAPEX-Sahel. The
   model performs fairly well, with a slight under-estimation which has
   been explained. From these results, it emerges that the kB(-1) parameter
   does not seem to be an appropriate and accurate tool to estimate
   sensible heat flux over sparse vegetation. Since it does not depend only
   on structural characteristics, it is not a constant parameter for a
   given vegetation, and thus, it can not be used in an operational way.}},

Abstract = {{The approach of using remote sensing of surface temperature to estimate
   spatially distributed surface energy balance components is very
   attractive. This approach has been applied successfully over surfaces
   with near full vegetation cover. However, large discrepancies between
   measured and simulated surface fluxes have been observed over surfaces
   with sparse vegetation cover. The reason for these discrepancies is that
   the assumption that radiative surface temperature can be equated to
   aerodynamic surface temperature is not correct over sparsely vegetated
   surfaces. In this study an empirical model, relating
   radiative-aerodynamic surface temperature difference to radiative-air
   temperature gradient and leaf area index, was used to estimate sensible
   heat flux over sparse shrub in the Central East supersite during the
   Hydrologic and Atmospheric Pilot Experiment in the Sahel (HAPEX-Sahel)
   measurement campaign. The result shows that this parameterization leads
   to reasonable estimates of sensible heat flux; the root mean square
   error (RMSE) was about 50 W m(-2) A second data set over sparse cotton
   in Arizona had a RMSE of about 20 W m(-2). Although the results of this
   study are encouraging, one should be cautious, however, because there is
   a need for additional investigation of this procedure.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial variability of sensible and latent heat flux measured by
   aircraft over a 90-km x 75-km area, near the Central Supersites of
   HAPEX-Sahel (Hydrologic and Atmospheric Pilot Experiment, Sahel) is
   discussed. The data from six Flights are presented four of which were
   obtained during the rainy season; the others being obtained at the
   beginning of the dry season.
   A basic difference in the behaviour of the latent heat transfer is
   revealed when the measurements under dry and wet conditions are
   compared: the latent heat flux is far more heterogeneous under drying
   conditions so that the estimation accuracy is reduced if the same
   integration length is used. It was found that under dry conditions the
   contribution of low frequency eddies is more important than that of
   local turbulence: the surface moisture is probably less homogeneous than
   in the wet period, but it is mostly the interaction between the marine
   and continental air masses linked to the closeness of the inter-tropical
   convergence zone that seems to drive the transfers.
   Two-dimensional fields of fluxes are constructed to study their spatial
   variability according to the hydrological conditions. These fields are
   systematically compared with those of the mean parameters likely to
   drive the transfers. Some characteristics, common to several fields, are
   revealed that can be considered specific to the climate in this region,
   at this time of year: an east-west gradient of albedo, a south-north
   gradient of the sensible heat flu. surface temperature and air
   temperature and a north-south gradient of specific humidity. However,
   the aerodynamic formula that relates flux to mean parameters, fails at a
   25-km x 25-km scale but fives good results at a larger scale (90 km x 75
   km): at this scale, the Dalton number is around 2.5 x 10(-3).}},

Abstract = {{In the framework of the HAPEX-Sahel experiment, a data set was gathered
   on a fallow savannah site of the Central East Supersite. This includes
   54 days of atmospheric forcing (air temperature and humidity, wind
   speed, solar and long-wave radiation and rainfall), net radiation,
   sensible, latent and soil heat fluxes and soil temperature series at a
   time step of 20 min. Furthermore, 17 soil moisture profiles, the
   evolution of the leaf area indices and some soil characteristics were
   available. The data set was used, at the field scale, to calibrate and
   validate the SiSPAT (simple soil plant atmosphere transfer) model, a 1D
   model of coupled heat and mass transfer in the soil-plant-atmosphere
   continuum.
   The objectives of the study were (i) to assess the performances of the
   model in the prediction of the diurnal cycle of net radiation, turbulent
   fluxes, soil temperatures and the evolution of soil water content over a
   period of 54 days (day of the year 239-292, 1992), characterized by
   early stage intense rainfall events and fast drying afterwards, (ii) to
   analyse the influence of soil surface crust on the water balance and
   (iii) to identify the 1D modelling limits when the surface area consists
   of two strates: a ground sparse herb laver, characterized by a large
   spatial variability of surface properties and water content with
   scattered bushes.
   The model was calibrated over a 2-week period and then nln over the
   whole 53-day period. We were able to reproduce the main characteristics
   of the observed net radiation, turbulent fluxes, soil temperature and
   soil moisture for the intense rainfall events and for an elongated dry
   period. Nevertheless, when the crust was not taken into account, the
   rainfall-runoff-infiltration process and the evapotranspiration after
   rain were poorly predicted (overestimation of evapotranspiration and
   infiltration). When a crust was considered to model the water balance at
   the field scale, its influence was found to be substantial on the runoff
   generation and the infiltration, and consequently on the bare soil
   evaporation. However, runoff predictions were much larger than the
   observations, indeed, at the field scale, no runoff was generally
   observed. Lateral redistribution of water between crusted and
   non-crusted zones was observed in the plot. However, this cannot be
   taken into account with the presented 1D deterministic modelling. Hence
   further model development is needed to yield a better representation of
   soil water fluxes at the field scale.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the results of Lettau's evapoclimatonomy model at
   daily time scales as applied to the Central East and Southern supersites
   of the HAPEX-Sahel region in Niger, West Africa. A revised version of
   the evapoclimatonomy model has been applied to the millet and bush
   fallow (Guiera senegalensis) fields at both supersites during the
   intensive observation period (IOP; 20 August-12 October, 1992), using
   daily means of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, solar
   radiation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the
   HAPEX-Sahel observations, as well as vegetation and soil parameters for
   the region. Soil moisture and immediate and delayed evapotranspiration
   and runoff are predicted, It has been found that the model predicts the
   soil moisture at the Central Eastern supersite quite well. However, it
   overestimates soil moisture at the Southern supersite even though its
   variability is captured by the model, Model results also indicate that
   soil moisture estimates are very sensitive to the NDVI-evaporivity
   relationship, which is robust at monthly scales but needs more revision
   for application at the daily scale. Overall the model performance when
   applied to the IOP observations is sufficiently good to indicate the
   suitability of the climatonomy for water balance studies on daily time
   scales.}},

Abstract = {{The variability of the Sahelian boundary layer has been studied with
   streamline analyses, rainfall measurements, and upper air soundings
   during its transition from wet to dry season. The 1992 rainy season
   ended prematurely because of the early arrival of westerly troughs over
   West Africa. The change in the circulation is related to global-scale
   atmospheric circulations as successive westerly troughs over this region
   can be traced back upstream on a planetary scale. Once the upper level
   easterlies changed to westerlies, the large-scale circulation brought
   the surface northeasterly flow southward, which led to the retreat of
   the Southwest Monsoon in Niger. The boundary layer responded quickly to
   this transition of synoptic events from wet to dry seasons. During the
   wet period, the boundary layer was relatively cool and moist because
   evapotranspiration dominated, keeping the surface cool and preventing
   significant direct sensible heating of the boundary layer. During the
   transition period, less extensive showery weather allowed the boundary
   layer to have more time to recover from rainfall episodes, leading to a
   warming and drying trend. During the dry period, soil moisture contents
   dropped rapidly. With more sensible heat flux made available for
   boundary layer heating and energetics, the boundary layer reached its
   maximum temperatures and minimum moisture contents during the
   Hydrological Atmospheric Pilot Experiment in the Sahel (HAPEX-Sahel)
   intensive observational period. Budget calculations indicate that the
   horizontal advection and vertical flux divergence terms were most
   important during the wet period, whereas during the dry period, the
   subsidence and vertical flux divergence terms were most important. From
   wet to dry seasons, the vertical wind shear of the zonal wind was
   reduced from 23 m s(-1) to 16 m s(-1) consistent with vertical wind
   shear differences between wet and dry years as reported in the
   literature. Similarities and differences with the First ISLSCP Field
   Experiment (FIFE-89) boundary layer are also examined. It is
   hypothesized that the retreat of the southwesterly monsoon could be
   upheld by a sustained secondary circulation if the wet season rainfall
   pattern imprints an organized south to north soil moisture gradient
   maintaining a concurrent reverse gradient in surface sensible heating.
   The boundary layer circulation that would be established in response to
   the heating gradient would reinforce surface southwesterlies. as well as
   reinforcing mid-level easterlies of which the African Easterly Jet is a
   part, and thus help uphold the intrusion of westerlies and the monsoon
   retreat. Such a mechanism. whose effectiveness would be a function of
   how distinct the south-north soil moisture gradient develops from the
   wet season precipitation pattern, could help explain the large
   interannual variability of rainfall over the Sahel.}},

Abstract = {{The boundary layer development over the Central sites of HAPEX-Sahel has
   been simulated for 4 individual days. The study is divided into two
   parts. In the first part a surface scheme is calibrated for the dominant
   land cover of the area, the fallow savanna. This calibration is
   performed for a period of 54 days encompassing the transition from wet
   to dry. A comparison is then made with another more detailed surface
   scheme. The model, in spite of its drastic simplification of reality, is
   able to reproduce the overall water balance for the period. In terms of
   relative contribution of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration
   it does not depart significantly from the more complex scheme.
   In the second part, the surface scheme is coupled to a one-dimensional
   version of the ARPEGE model (operational forecast model at
   Meteo-France). The importance of the direct heating of the boundary
   layer by aerosols is stressed. With minor modifications of calibration
   parameters from the first phase, boundary layer profiles of temperature
   and also mixing ratio are reproduced with a good accuracy.}},

   typical diurnal cycle during the dry down period of the intensive
   observation period on 8 October 1992. The model has a grid length of 10
   km, with a domain covering a region of approximately 1000 km(2), centred
   on the HAPEX experiment. Satellite images are used to generate a
   mesoscale land cover map over the region. To initialise the soil
   moisture, a simple soil moisture accounting model was developed. This
   generates soil moisture patterns from daily rainfall estimates over the
   entire mesoscale domain. Where possible, the land surface scheme has
   been calibrated with measurements taken during the experiment.
   Moisture availability is the principle component in determining the
   partition of energy at the surface. The mean midday Bowen ratio of the
   square is 0.62. However, spatial contrasts in soil moisture availability
   lead to a range of midday sensible heat fluxes of between 100 W m(-2)
   and 280 W m(-2) The pattern of surface fluxes is closely related to the
   mesoscale variation of the seasonal rainfall.
   Comparisons of the model output with surface meteorology, surface
   fluxes, sonde and aircraft measurements are encouraging. Both model and
   climate observations show similar gradients at the surface across the
   square. Features of the aircraft measurements are well represented by
   the model. Anomalous increases in latent heat Bur with height measured
   by the aircraft are also found in the model. This may be related to high
   entrainment fluxes at the inversion separating contrasting air flows.
   Heat and moisture budget calculations show the importance of large scale
   flow in the evolution of the boundary layer. Periods of low level
   south-westerly flow for example produce considerably larger inputs of
   moisture into the planetary boundary layer than surface evaporation. In
   this study, the influence of surface flux variability on the boundary
   laver is limited. However, scaling surface fluxes up to larger scales
   must take some account of the considerable variation in soil moisture.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of the field saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-fs) is
   essential for ground-water management and for numerical modeling of
   ground-water flow and contaminant transport. The constant-head borehole
   test can be used to measure K-fs of deep soils. For a deep borehole of
   H/alpha = 10-500, where H is the water height in the borehole and alpha
   is the radius, the accuracy of the estimated K-fs varies depending on
   the shape factor associated with H/alpha. Many analytical solutions have
   been obtained on the basis of approximate boundary conditions available
   to evaluate the shape factor. To find the best solution that provides an
   accurate shape factor, the accuracy of the different solutions was
   evaluated using a series of numerical simulations that satisfy the
   pressure boundary condition of the borehole test. Our comparison, on the
   basis of the analytical and numerical solutions, shows that for
   homogeneous soils the K-fs calculated by Xiang's solution (Xiang, 1993,
   Eos Trans. Am. Geophys. Union, 74(43): 285) and that by Reynolds et al.
   (1983, Soil Sci, 136: 250-268) are almost identical to the numerical
   results. Xiang's solution, however, was found to be more accurate for
   evaluating the flow distribution than was that of Reynolds et al.}},

Abstract = {{A study conducted in 1994 as part of the US Geological Survey's National
   Water-Quality Assessment Program, South Piatte River Basin
   investigation, examined the effect of certain environmental factors on
   potential denitrification rates in nitrate-rich riverbed sediments. The
   acetylene block technique was used to measure nitrous oxide (N2O)
   production rates in laboratory incubations of riverbed sediments to
   evaluate the effect of varying nitrate concentrations, organic carbon
   concentrations and type, and water temperature on potential
   denitrification rates. Sediment incubations amended with nitrate, at
   concentrations ranging from 357 to 2142 mu mol l(-1) (as measured in the
   field), produced no significant increase (P > 0.05) in N2O production
   rates, indicating that the denitrification potential in these sediments
   was not nitrate limited. In contrast, incubations amended with acetate
   as a source of organic carbon, at concentrations ranging from 0 to 624
   mu mol l(-1), produced significant increases (P < 0.05) in N2O
   production rates with increased organic carbon concentration, indicating
   that the denitrification potential in these sediments was organic carbon
   limited. Furthermore, N2O production rates also were affected by the
   type of organic carbon available as an electron donor. Acetate and
   surface-water-derived fulvic acid supported higher N2O production rates
   than groundwater-derived fulvic acid or sedimentary organic carbon.
   Lowering incubation temperatures from 22 to 4 degrees C resulted in
   about a 77\% decrease in the N2O production rates. These results help to
   explain findings from previous studies indicating that only 15-30\% of
   nitrate in groundwater was denitrified before discharging to the South
   Platte River and that nitrate concentrations in the river generally were
   higher in winter than in summer.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy clay soils are characterized by a strong power-law dependence of
   the soil water potential on the soil water content. Numerical solutions
   for water transport are difficult for such soils so that analytical
   solutions become crucial. Asymptotic solutions are derived for the
   sorption of water by an initially dry, heavy clay soil which are valid
   in the limit of large power-law exponent, as defined by the Campbell
   relation. The most general boundary condition considered is surface flux
   as a power-law function of time with arbitrary exponent. A new exact
   solution is also derived for the Richards equation which is valid for a
   particular time-dependence of the surface flux. It is shown that a
   previous asymptotic solution in another context is a special case of the
   solutions of this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial changes in streamwater chemistry in seven upland catchments in
   NE Scotland have been studied using samples collected at 250 m intervals
   from the stream source to the catchment outlet. The catchments contain a
   number of different parent materials including granites and diorite from
   the Lochnagar Complex, and metasediments and metabasites from the Argyll
   and Appin Groups of the Dalradian Supergroup. Samples were collected
   under low flow conditions between June 1989 and January 1990 and ten
   component ions were determined; this paper concentrates on pH, Ca, Mg,
   Na and K.
   All seven catchments show major changes in stream solute concentrations
   along their length. Samples collected immediately downstream of the
   source typically show a rapid increase in pH with distance, reflecting
   degassing in the stream of CO2 from the soil solution. Further down the
   catchment small-scale spatial changes in streamwater chemistry appear to
   be strongly influenced by the underlying geology. As the stream flows
   over parent materials with distinctly different geochemical
   characteristics, the pH, and Ca and Mg concentrations in the stream show
   rapid changes, reflecting changes in the underlying lithology. In a
   number of the catchments K also exhibits significant spatial variability
   along the length of the stream. The underlying geology appears to have
   little effect on Na concentrations, which typically increase from the
   source to the bottom of the catchment.
   These data suggest that small-scale spatial changes in streamwater
   chemistry may provide a useful tool for identifying changes in the
   underlying geology in poorly exposed areas. In addition, they also have
   implications for regional critical load mapping and prediction of
   streamwater sensitivity to acidification.}},

Abstract = {{The Maastrichtian aquifer in the Senegalese sedimentary basin appears
   completely confined and is characterised by a relatively high geothermal
   gradient (0.03-0.06 degrees C m(-1)). In the upper part of the aquifer,
   temperatures are strongly related to the depth of the roof. At the basin
   scale, this could mask possible thermal transfer. However, in the SE,
   thermal anomalies have been observed in some boreholes; moreover,
   radiocarbon investigations have indicated abnormally long groundwater
   residence times. Recharge occurs mainly in this zone, near the basement
   margin, by leakage from the upper aquifer through semi-permeable beds.
   The natural vertical discharge of the Maastrichtian aquifer occurs
   beyond the line of equal piezometric level between the upper and lower
   aquifer.
   By comparing the aquifer to a porous U-tube and imposing the same input
   and output, the flow patterns have been studied numerically using the
   finite element method. Different numerical simulations have involved
   fluctuations of three quantities: the geothermal gradient, the intrinsic
   permeability and the input rate. They indicate that, for the mean values
   observed in the aquifer, natural convection could occur. When the input
   rate increases, the convective cells have a tendency to break up but
   significant mixing remains. In such cases, interpretation of residence
   times with natural isotopes is more difficult.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that forest age bears a strong relationship
   with regional mean annual streamflow from catchments forested with
   mountain ash in the central highlands of Victoria, Australia. Mean
   annual streamflow of 585 mm from catchments forested with 30-year-old
   mountain ash compares with mean annual streamflow of 1195 mm from the
   same catchments that 27 years previously were forested with old growth
   mountain ash. About three-quarters of the difference can be explained by
   a difference in transpiration, and the remainder by a difference in
   interception loss.
   Based on earlier observations that differences in transpiration between
   mountain ash overstoreys aged 50, 90, 150 and 230 years can largely be
   explained by differences in stand sapwood cross-sectional areas,
   variation in transpiration with age was accounted for by fitting a
   log-normal relationship to overstorey sapwood areas measured in six
   mountain ash stands aged from 7 to 235 years. The sapwood area of the
   eucalypt overstorey reached a peak of 10.5 m(2) ha(-1) at about age 15
   and then declined gradually to 2.5 m(2) ha(-1) at age 200. A log-normal
   relationship fitted to a time series of throughfall measurements from
   mountain ash forests ranging in age from 1 to 244 years indicates the
   peak interception loss of 25\% to occur at age 30. Interception loss
   gradually declines to 17\% at age 200 years.}},

Abstract = {{For two-dimensional groundwater flow governed by Laplace's equation
   there exists both a discharge potential function and a stream function,
   which are each other's conjugate harmonics. The stream function is
   constant along a streamline, and the difference in its value for two
   streamlines represents the total flow between these streamlines. Most
   regional groundwater flow problems, however, exhibit areal recharge and
   leakage from adjacent aquifers. These problems are governed by Poisson's
   equation; no stream function exists for that case. In the context of the
   analytic element method (AEM), a technique has been developed which
   allows the stream function to be used in models which include areal
   recharge or leakage. The AEM uses superposition of analytic functions;
   the majority satisfy Laplace's equation, whereas only a few functions
   satisfy Poisson's equation. By treating these solutions to Poisson's
   equation separately, the stream function can be utilized in a manner
   similar to that for flow without areal recharge or leakage. The approach
   is applied to streamline tracing and, more importantly, to the modeling
   of leaky slurry walls and no-flow boundaries, both open and closed.}},
