Abstract = {{The city of Amsterdam obtains one third of its drinking water from
   groundwater, which seeps upward into the deep Polder Bethune. The water
   is pumped out towards a lake that acts as a 100-day retention basin. The
   production has to be increased and therefore a second lake will be
   adapted to accommodate the increased Row. Its bottom layer will be
   excavated and thus a change in the hydrologic situation will occur,
   which might influence nearby nature reserves with high floral values. Ln
   order to investigate the influence of different scenarios for the
   maintained water level in the new retention basin on the local and
   regional flow systems, a model study was carried out using the
   model-code, multi layer analytic element model. Use of this method made
   it possible to simulate the steep gradients around nearby deep polders
   and the subtle changes from infiltration to seepage near the lakes in an
   outstanding manner. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Province of Friesland is conducting a study on possible future
   changes in the surface water and groundwater systems of Friesland. The
   aim of the study is to assess what changes might be caused by land
   subsidence and a rise in sea level-focusing in particular on the
   salinization of the surface water-by modelling the flow of groundwater
   in the coastal zone of the Province of Friesland.
   A three-dimensional density distribution of groundwater (based on the
   chloride distribution in the groundwater) can be projected by using the
   density dependent version of the MLAEM software: MVAEM (Strack, O.D.L.,
   1989. Multi-layer aquifer modeling using the analytical element method.
   Proc. 4th Int. Conf. on the use of models to findworking solutions to
   groundwater problems, National Water Well Association, Dublin, Ohio,
   USA, 1995). Construction of a fully three-dimensional density
   distribution is based on irregularly spaced chloride concentration data
   points. These are interpolated using a three-dimensional multi-quadric
   interpolator ( in MVAEM). For some pits of the model area, chloride
   data, were not available (e.g. the Wadden Sea), for these regions
   chloride concentrations were estimated (based on gee-electric and other
   information) and assigned to artificial data points, which were added to
   the data set. The techniques used for this process were developed during
   the construction of the coastal elements in NAGROM-the NAtional
   GROundwater Model for The Netherlands (De Lange, W.J., van der Meij.
   J.L., 1995. NAGROM (National GROundwater Model). RIZA, Lelystad, TNO-GG,
   Delft, The Netherlands; Dr Lange, W.J., 1996. Groundwater modeling of
   large domains with analytic elements. Delft University of Technology,
   Delft, The Netherlands).
   The influences of a sea-level rise and land subsidence on the
   groundwater system were simulated by computational modelling of
   density-driven groundwater flow. The groundwater model that was used is
   a refined version of the regional model contained in NAGROM, based on
   the analytic element method (Strack;, 1989). NAGROM is a national water
   management tool for evaluating different water conservation and
   distribution policies. It was developed by the Institute for Inland
   Water Management and Waste Water Treatment in co-operation with The
   Netherlands Institute of Applied Geoscience TNO (NITG-TNO).
   The effect of a sea-level rise and land subsidence was calculated for a
   50-year period. Salinization of the surface waters by discharged
   groundwater in the Northern part of The Netherlands was compared with
   the evolution of the region not including sea-level rise and land
   subsidence. The amount of saline discharge as Dart of the surface water
   balance was calculated under special boundary conditions set according
   to the proposed sea-level rise and land subsidence in a semi-unsteady
   state. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two of the complicating factors in modeling the regional groundwater
   flow at Yucca Mountain are the large distance to hydrogeologic
   boundaries and the large thickness of the aquifer; the hydrogeologic
   boundaries are up to 500 km away from Yucca Mountain, and the aquifer is
   up to 5000 m thick. The distant hydrogeologic boundaries may be taken
   into account explicitly by application of the analytic element method,
   which is applied to a model of this size for the first time in this
   study. The analytic element method makes it possible to include distant
   hydrogeologic boundaries and at the same time allows for local derail
   without the excessive computational effort that would be required with
   the finite difference method. Regional flow in the aquifer is modeled
   with a single layer, based on a theoretical argument and supported by
   the model results. The match between simulated and measured heads is
   similar to that of previous finite difference models of parts of the
   region; these previous studies consist of multiple layers and include
   inferred boundary conditions (head or flux specified) along most of the
   boundary of the domain. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An approach, the superblock approach, is presented for increasing
   computational efficiency of analytic element models. The approach is
   based on computing the combined effect of functions using both
   asymptotic expansions and Taylor Series expansions. The superblocks are
   used to reduce both the computational effort required to determine the
   coefficients in the analytic element model and to reduce the effort
   expended in generating contour plots and streamlines. An application of
   flow is presented in an aquifer with one hundred thousand circular
   impermeable objects. The errors in the simulation are within the machine
   accuracy. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   line elements in modeling two-dimensional groundwater flow. These
   elements are line-doublets, line-dipoles and line-sinks. The jump

Abstract = {{We argue that contaminant transport is intrinsically wave-like, rather
   than diffusive. Starting with an empirical observation, we end up with a
   one-dimensional hyperbolic dispersion equation that was proposed earlier
   by Scheidegger. Out arguments are merely logical. but we have
   experimental evidence in support of our viewpoint. We extend our
   equation to two spatial dimensions. In accordance with the hyperbolic
   nature of our model, the spatial bounds of a contaminated spot appear to
   propagate like wave fronts. Their velocity and extension can he
   calculated quits easily, of which we give an elementary example. Their
   propagation is controlled by a new medium characteristic, which we
   propose to call angle of spreading. This parameter depends on the
   dispersion of the medium, and on the propagation velocities of the rip
   and the toe of a dispersing front. As yet we have no hard indications of
   the magnitude of this angle, but we estimate it very tentatively to lie
   between 2 and 6 degrees, (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   such that within the cell the flow is two-dimensional. Explicit rigorous
   expressions for the specific discharge vector are presented. The
   effective conductivity is calculated by rigorous integration of the head
   and velocity fields over the elementary cell. With variation of the
   angle of the imposed field the: absolute value of effective conductivity
   is shown to be an ellipse. A steady state regime and a cyclostationary
   flow are analyzed by tracking marked particles on the scale of the
   elementary cell. The kinematic characteristics (travel time
   distributions, path lines. and distortion pictures of reference volumes)
   are calculated using the Runge-Kutta integration for a limiting case
   when one side of the constituting rectangles tend to infinity (a fault
   in a standard layered system). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A regional groundwater model may cover many surface waters and drains,
   which are difficult to include individually in a model. Large canals,
   rivers and other surface waters that are in direct contact with the
   upper regional aquifer may be included individually because their number
   is relatively small. The effects of the remaining drains and surface
   waters on the flow to or fi um that aquifer may be combined over some
   area. A method is presented to lump the interaction between an arbitrary
   number of surface waters and drains and the groundwater flow in a
   regional aquifer within an arbitrary area (e.g. cell or element). The
   effect of the saturated groundwater flow between the drains and surface
   waters and the regional aquifer is translated into a Cauchy boundary
   condition that is applied at the upper boundary of the regional
   groundwater model. The constants that feature in that boundary condition
   are derived from a closed-form solution of the governing differential
   equation and the boundary conditions. The present approach is applicable
   in any arbitrary area (and so in elements or cells of any shape) with
   any number of surface waters provided that, in the vicinity of the
   surface waters, the variation in the head in the regional aquifer is
   considerably smaller than the variation in the phreatic head. The
   approach has been tested and applied extensively in the Netherlands. (C)

Abstract = {{A model for unsaturated groundwater flow describes processes in much
   smaller space and time units than a model for regional saturated
   groundwater flow. Coupling of these models requires up- and downscaling.
   For this, an approach is presented that uses one and the same Cauchy
   boundary condition for both models bur at different scales. This
   boundary condition describes the lumped interaction between groundwater
   and surface waters. A GIS-interface is used to compute the parameters in
   the boundary conditions of both models based on a single database of
   properties in a consistent way. The models run sequentially while in
   between output data of one model are scaled up or down to input for the
   other model. The continuity of flow between both models is used as a
   check of the accuracy during the coupling. The approach has been tested
   and implemented in a GIS-based interface between two Dutch groundwater
   models for national water management. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{An analytic procedure is presented to investigate the response of
   temperature in and evaporation from saline solutions whose activity
   coefficients are subject to dynamic changes. The temperature change
   (gamma) with respect to changes in the activity coefficient is found to
   be a strong function of the saturation vapor pressure at the temperature
   of the saline solution and the transfer coefficients for water vapor and
   sensible heat. Results show that gamma increases appreciably as the
   activity coefficient (beta) departs further from unity. As the activity
   coefficient approaches unity, gamma becomes quite small particularly
   when both the saline solution temperature and the transfer coefficients
   decrease. For a given change in the activity coefficient, the largest
   temperature response is experienced during the summer months.
   The procedure developed in this paper is applied to the current chemical
   composition of the Dead Sea to examine the sensitivities of its
   temperature and evaporation rate due to the alteration of its activity
   coefficient during the past 40 years. Results show that currently
   evaporation from the Dead Sea (beta approximate to 0.67) is about 175 mm
   year(-1) less than the values prior to 1960 (beta approximate to 0.75).

Abstract = {{The major barriers to modeling hydrological processes in semi-arid and
   arid areas are a lack of understanding and model representations of the
   distinctive features and processes associated with runoff generation in
   those regions and a paucity of field data. In this study, TOPOG,
   developed by CSIRO in Australia, was modified by adding model
   representations of some of the predominant features and processes
   identified through field and experimental investigations on a semi-arid
   agricultural catchment with complex-terrain and mixed land use in the
   Loess Plateau of China. The modified models were then used to
   continuously simulate both slowly changing hydrologic states during
   interstorm periods and fast-responding overland and tunnel flows during
   stormflow periods. Finally, the effectiveness of model simulation under
   a wide range of rainfall and spatiotemporally varied land cover
   conditions was tested by comparison of simulated and observed stormflow
   discharges from both catchment outlet and internal plots. Considerable
   variability in simulation accuracy was found among storm events and
   within the catchment. The simulation results highlight the critical
   importance of crusting and some land management practices on stormflow
   generation and its spatial variation in this area. Overall, the
   simulations showed that the model represents reasonably well stormflows
   generated by rainfall events with recurrence intervals >2 years, which
   account for more than 60\% of runoff and 70\% of sediment leaving this
   area. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An extension to the two-parameter multilinear discrete cascade model for
   channel routing is presented. The linear subcomponent of the extended
   three-parameter model combines a discrete cascade with a conceptual
   discrete linear channel element characterised by a time-delay parameter.
   The inclusion of this explicit advective time-delay makes the model
   particularly suitable for forecasting applications. The time-variable
   parameters are related to physical channel characteristics by a method
   of moments utilising the generalised linear response of a uniform
   channel of any shape and any friction law. The utility of the extended
   model is examined through comparison with results of the multilinear
   model and the solutions of the full St Venant equations for various
   hydraulic conditions and channel shapes. The results show that without
   sacrificing model simplicity, the additional degree of freedom of the
   extended model enables better prediction of the flood propagation
   process described by the full equations. Additionally, it is found that
   the linear approximation of the proposed mathematical representation
   gives sufficiently accurate predictions over short distances to allow
   practical utilisation of powerful methods of system parameter
   estimation. Good results were obtained in uniform channels characterised
   by open looped-rating curves at the inlet and outlet boundaries.
   However, the downstream boundary condition considered, based on the
   Manning equation, is only valid where no hydraulic structures or
   physical channel changes occur at the downstream location, or where
   backwater effects due to tides, tributaries or critical control sections
   do not affect the hydraulic response at the boundary. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Title = {{Multi-scale alluvial fan heterogeneity modeled with transition
   probability geostatistics in a sequence stratigraphic framework}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{226}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{48-65}},

Abstract = {{The complexity of alluvial fan depositional systems makes derailed
   characterization of their heterogeneity difficult, yet such detailed
   characterizations are commonly needed for construction of reliable
   groundwater models. The transition probability geostatistical approach
   provides a means to quantify the distribution of hydrofacies in the
   subsurface. However, a key assumption used in this and other
   geostatistical approaches is that of stationarity. Stratigraphic
   character often varies within a deposit, making this assumption tenuous.
   Sequence stratigraphic concepts help us overcome this problem by
   dividing the strata into units that have similar properties, called
   sequences, based on recognition of unconformities and timelines within
   the sedimentary record. By using transition probability geostatistics in
   a sequence stratigraphic framework, realizations of the alluvial fan
   facies distributions are produced that account for multi-scale
   heterogeneity represented by spatially variable hydrofacies within
   sequences, laterally extensive aquitard units at sequence boundaries,
   and spatial variability attributes that are unique to each sequence,
   incorporation of conceptual geologic information into the Markov chain
   model of transition probability also allows development of improved
   coregionalization models in the typically undersampled, lateral
   directions.
   The Kings River Alluvial Fan, located southeast of Fresno, California,
   provides an excellent test case for the approach. Several sequences
   within the alluvial fan were produced by outwash from Pleistocene
   glaciations in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Five sequences, separated by
   large-scale (>3 km laterally), mature, red paleosols, were recognized in
   the alluvial fan strata. Markov chain models were developed to
   characterize the intermediate-scale (0.3-1.5 km laterally) distribution
   of hydrofacies in each individual sequence and to characterize the
   spatial distribution of paleosols. Separate conditional simulation of
   each sequence provides realizations of hydrofacies distributions.
   Combining these five sequence realizations into a single realization,
   then overprinting the paleosol distributions onto this realization,
   produced a geologically plausible image of the subsurface facies
   distribution that accounts for non-stationarity between stratigraphic
   units. Importantly, the resulting realization preserves the lateral
   continuity of the large-scale sequence boundary paleosols, which are
   potentially important confining beds within the fan deposits.
   Additionally, facies juxtaposition tendencies (e.g. upward fining
   tendencies of the fluvial deposits) and known directional anisotropy and
   dip of units within the fan are preserved in the realization. These
   physical attributes, accurately reproduced by the geostatistical method,
   are essential components of the overall hydrogeologic character of the
   alluvial fan. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Information on water balance dynamics is an essential component of
   studies of the role of the boreal forest in surface-atmosphere
   interactions and climate change. The water balance of a small boreal
   forest basin in northern Manitoba was examined using a semi-distributed
   approach to assess basin sensitivity to climate change, provide a
   framework for distributed hydrological modelling, and explore data
   aggregation and micro-to-meso scaling of hydroclimatological variables.
   Black spruce forest with a highly variable canopy density was the main
   land cover in the basin. Spring snowmelt dominated basin runoff, while
   summer outputs were largely via evaporation. Annual differences in
   spring runoff were controlled by variations in snow water equivalent,
   rainfall timing and magnitude, thaw depth, and antecedent water content
   in surface stores and upland soils. Water storage in small wetlands and
   ephemeral surface depressions in the open-canopy black spruce forest and
   its subsequent loss via evaporation was a fundamental component of the
   basin water balance. However, its role could be overlooked by
   inappropriate spatial lumping of landscape units when scaling-up
   variables or in the production of depressionless digital terrain models.
   Hydrological consequences of climate warming in this part of the boreal
   forest include: (i) increased evaporation following spring snowmelt in
   open black spruce areas; (ii) decreased surface and soil water storage
   on basin slopes; and (iii) reduced streamflow response to spring runoff
   and summer and fall rainstorms. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Many hydrological engineering planning, design, and management problems
   require a derailed knowledge of flood event characteristics, such as
   flood peak, volume and duration. Flood frequency analysis often focuses
   on flood peak values, and hence, provides a limited assessment of flood
   events. This paper proposes the use of the Gumbel mixed model, the
   bivariate extreme value distribution model with Gumbel marginals, to
   analyze the joint probability distribution of correlated hood peaks and
   volumes, and the joint probability distribution of correlated hood
   volumes and durations. Based on the marginal distributions of these
   random variables, the joint distributions, the conditional probability
   functions, and the associated return periods are derived. The model is
   tested and validated using observed flood data from the Ashuapmushuan
   river basin in the province of Quebec, Canada. Results indicate that the
   model is suitable for representing the joint distributions of hood peaks
   and volumes, as well as flood volumes and durations. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Streamflow was calculated from meteorological data using the UBC
   Watershed Model for 12 heterogeneous watersheds in British Columbia.
   These watersheds varied in drainage area, climate, topography, soil type
   vegetation and geology, which indicates that statistical regionalization
   of streamflow is likely to be unreliable. The model results indicated
   that an average set of model parameters could be applied to all the
   watersheds, provided that representative meteorological data was
   available and the impermeable fraction of the watersheds could be
   determined from independent sources such as natural vegetative cover and
   surficial geology. The averaged model parameter set gave Nash-Sutcliffe
   statistical results only slightly lower than results from a full
   calibration. Therefore the method appears to be useful for complete
   pre-calibration of ungauged watersheds so that flows can be generated
   for these ungauged sites. The method has been successfully tested on an
   independent watershed in British Columbia and another watershed in the
   Himalayas. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Annual maximum flood (AMF) sampling remains the most popular approach to
   flood frequency analysis. An alternative, the ``peaks over threshold{''}
   (POT) approach, deals with the selection of over-threshold values.
   However, the POT approach remains under-employed mainly because of the
   complexities associated with its use. Among the difficulties are the
   choice of threshold and the selection of criteria for retaining flood
   peaks. The literature remains sparse and incoherent concerning the
   various elements and complexities of the POT model. The purpose of the
   present paper is to shed some light on some of the recurrent and most
   important questions with regard to the practice of POT modeling, and to
   make a first step in establishing a set of coherent practice-oriented
   guidelines for the use of the POT model. This paper reviews tests and
   methods useful for modeling the process of over-threshold values, the
   choice of the threshold level, the verification of the independence of
   the values and the stationarity of the process, and also presents an
   application. (C) 1994 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   the aim of improving the knowledge of the flow and sediment production.
   The catchment area (30 km(2)) was equipped with rainfall gauges, two
   flow control sections and a sediment trap. The paper reports 6 years of
   data, with one extreme hood and 11 minor flow events. A simple
   rainfall-runoff model HEC-1. yielded good agreement with respect to
   field measurements, provided high transmission losses are taken into
   account. Bed load volume, however, is at least four times greater than

Abstract = {{The Cl/Br ratio (wt/wt) of port: water in a lake, having diverse saline
   inputs, was used to distinguish among the influx of different water
   sources and estimate their relative; contributions.
   Pore water concentration profiles obtained by a passive multi-layer
   sampler from bottom sediments of Lake Kinneret, Israel, depict Cl/Br
   ratios that vary between 70 and 156 and are similar to ratios in nearby
   onshore springs - Hamei Tiberias and Fulya, respectively. The Cl/Br
   ratio of the lake (135) is strongly influenced by the Cl/Br fingerprint
   of Fulya-type water. However, the discharge of the known Fulya springs
   can not provide the required Br- mass (about 648 tons/y) to maintain the
   Cl/Br ratio in the lake. Therefore, diffusive and advective fluxes of
   port: water are additional important mechanisms by which Br- is added to
   lake water. Moreover, it is demonstrated that a combination of Fulya and
   Hamei Tiberias-type waters (90 and 10\%, respectively) can explain the
   Cl/Br ratio of the lake. The areal distribution of the Cl/Br ratio in
   pore water may be the result of dilution of an ancient evaporated
   solution (Cl/Br approximate to 70) with fresh water from adjacent
   aquifers (Cl/Br greater than or equal to 150), followed by mixing with a
   saline solution having a high Cl/Br ratio (Cl/Br approximate to 300) The
   results of this work suggest that the Cl/Br ratio is a sensitive tool
   for the study of other similar environments. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{In many studies, data from transient or quasi steady-state solute
   transport experiments are modeled using steady-state models. Few
   investigations, however, have been carried out to verify the validity of
   this approach. In this paper, we study the effects of water application
   frequency on the parameters derived using steady-state models. Bromide
   transport was studied in an undisturbed soil column of loamy sand
   exhibiting fingered flow. Four solute displacement experiments were
   carried out under quasi steady-state flow conditions. The mean water
   flux in all experiments was 1.42 cm d(-1), but water was applied at
   different time intervals for each; that is one, two, three, or six times
   daily. Water content and solute concentration were measured following an
   in situ calibration, using time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes at
   nine different depths. The TDR probes were placed in two alternate
   directions, with every second probe being orthogonal to the first. The
   convective-dispersive (CDE) and the convective log-normal transfer
   function (CLT)models were fitted to the solute transport data. The CDE
   model best described the solute transport. The dispersivity decreased
   when water was applied more often. The decrease can largely be
   attributed to lesser variability of the water flux velocity, especially
   in one of the probe directions. The mass recovery was about 40\% for all
   depths and did not change with the differing intervals between water
   applications. Solute transport heterogeneity was also constant during
   the experiments. These observations lead to the conclusion that
   preferential flow paths in this soil were consistent and independent of
   application frequency. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This contribution discusses a tracer experiment, which was performed to
   study the flow paths of water in a macroporous forest soil. The
   experiment was performed in the framework of a study on the cycling of
   nitrogen in forested Prealpine catchments, in which losses of nitrate
   from virtually pristine areas were observed. Two soil plots with
   distinct micro-topography and top-soil were investigated: a well drained
   mor humus on a mound and a wet muck humus in a small depression. To
   reveal the effect of the soil horizons on the flow regime, tracers were
   applied both onto the soil surface and injected into the sub-soil.
   Tracers injected directly into the gleyic sub-soil reached the outlet
   (at a distance of 3.3 m) about 1000 times faster than could be expected
   from the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix. Peak
   concentrations were observed after 18 (muck humus, tracer recovery 31\%)
   to 70 min (mor humus, tracer recovery 40\%). The peak concentration was
   10 times smaller on the drier mor humus plot as compared to the muck
   humus. The mobile water content of the sub-soil varied between 0.5 (muck
   humus) and 1.3\% (mor humus) of the total available soil water. The
   discrepancy in residence time, peak concentration and volume of mobile
   water between both sub-soils can be attributed to the differently
   structured sub-soil (longer travel distance and mixing volume in the
   drier mor humus). Tracers applied onto the soil surface resulted in a
   much slower breakthrough (tracer peaks after 400-700 min). Thus, in
   contrast to the sub-soil, flow through the matrix was the predominating
   transport process in the upper humus layers of both plots. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Recent surveys of tropical forest water use suggest that rainfall
   interception by the canopy is largest in wet maritime locations. To
   investigate the underlying processes at one such location-the Luquillo
   Experimental Forest in eastern Puerto Rico-66 days of detailed
   throughfall and above-canopy climatic data were collected in 1996 and
   analysed using the Rutter and Gash models of rainfall interception.
   Throughfall occurred on 80\% of the days distributed over 80 rainfall
   events. Measured interception loss was 50\% of gross precipitarion. When
   Penman-Monteith based estimates for the wet canopy evaporation rate
   (0.11 mm h(-1) on average) and a canopy storage of 1.15 mm were used,
   both models severely underestimated measured interception loss. A
   detailed analysis of four storms using the Rutter model showed that
   optimizing the model for the wet canopy evaporation component yielded
   much better results than increasing the canopy storage capacity.
   However, the Rutter model failed to properly estimate throughfall
   amounts during an exceptionally large event. The analytical model, on
   the other hand, was capable of representing interception during the
   extreme event, but once again optimizing wet canopy evaporation rates
   produced a much better fit than optimizing the canopy storage capacity.
   As such, the present results support the idea that it is primarily a
   high rate of evaporation from a wet canopy that is responsible for the
   observed high interception losses. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Underground water flow in sedimentary basins controls the distribution
   of dissolved salts and gases, and their concentrations may therefore be
   used as indicators of the flow direction. Recent measurements of the
   He-4 concentration in deep waters of the Pannonian basin have great
   importance in this respect. This paper presents an example of the
   simultaneous computation of water flow and helium distribution along a
   section crossing the Great Hungarian Plain. The model consists of three
   permeable layers. The boundaries of the layers are prescribed using
   geologic sections constrained by ample borehole and seismic data. The
   results of the finite-difference calculations are fitted to the observed
   helium concentrations using a least-squares algorithm that varies the
   model parameters;The significance of the model is that it reconstructs
   the structure and flux of the groundwater flow and estimates the poorly
   known hydrogeological parameters of the flow regime such as hydraulic
   conductivities, conductivity anisotropy and dispersion coefficients. The
   statistical uncertainty of the estimated parameters is around half an
   order of magnitude. An estimate of the regional average of the incoming
   helium flux is also obtained. The total helium flux in the Great
   Hungarian Plain at the surface is within the range observed in old
   stable continental areas of the Earth. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Number = {{1-2}},

Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{A solution for the general problem of computing well how in vertically
   heterogeneous aquifers is found by an integration of both analytical and
   numerical techniques. The radial component of flow is treated
   analytically; the drawdown is a continuous function of the distance to
   the well. The finite-difference technique is used for the vertical flow
   component only. The aquifer is discretized in the vertical dimension and
   the heterogeneous aquifer is considered to be a layered (stratified)
   formation with a finite number of homogeneous sublayers, where each
   sublayer may have different properties. The transient part of the
   differential equation is solved with Stehfest's algorithm, a numerical
   inversion technique of the Laplace transform. The well is of constant
   discharge and penetrates one or more of the sublayers. The effect of
   wellbore storage on early drawdown data is taken into account. In this
   way drawdowns an found for a finite number of sublayers as a continuous
   function of radial distance to the well and of time since the pumping
   started.
   The model is verified by comparing results with published analytical and
   numerical solutions for well flow in homogeneous and heterogeneous,
   confined and unconfined aquifers. Instantaneous and delayed drainage of
   water from above the water table are considered, combined with the
   effects of partially penetrating and finite-diameter wells. The model is
   applied to demonstrate that the transient effects of wellbore storage in
   unconfined aquifers are less pronounced than previous numerical
   experiments suggest. Other applications of the presented solution
   technique are given for partially penetrating wells in heterogeneous
   formations, including a demonstration of the effect of decreasing
   specific storage values with depth in an otherwise homogeneous aquifer.
   The presented solution can be a powerful tool for the analysis of
   drawdown from pumping tests, because hydraulic properties of layered
   heterogeneous aquifer systems with partially penetrating wells may be
   estimated without the need to construct transient numerical models. A
   computer program based on the hybrid analytical-numerical technique is
   available from the author. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Previously a hybrid analytical-numerical solution for the general
   problem of computing transient well how in vertically heterogeneous
   aquifers was proposed by the author. The radial component of flow was
   treated analytically, while the finite-difference technique was used for
   the vertical flow component only. In the present work thr hybrid
   solution has been modified by replacing the previously assumed uniform
   well-face gradient (UWG) boundary condition in such a way that the
   drawdown remains uniform along the well screen. The resulting uniform
   well-face drawdown (UWD) solution also includes the effects of a finite
   diameter well, wellbore storage and a thin skin, while partial
   penetration and vertical heterogeneity are accommodated by the
   one-dimensional discretization. Solutions are proposed for well flow
   caused by constant, variable and slug discharges.
   The model was verified by comparing wellbore drawdowns and well-face
   flux distributions with published numerical solutions. Differences
   between UWG and UWD well how will occur in all situations with vertical
   flow components near the well, which is demonstrated by considering: (1)
   partially penetrating wells in confined aquifers, (2) fully penetrating
   wells in unconfined aquifers with delayed response and (3) layered
   aquifers and leaky multiaquifer systems.
   The presented solution can be a powerful tool for solving many
   well-hydraulic problems, including well tests, flowmeter tests, slug
   tests and pumping tests. A computer program for the analysis of pumping
   tests, based on the hybrid analytical-numerical technique and UWG or UWD
   conditions, is available from the author. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{The role of the data aggregation scale on parameters estimation of the
   cluster-based Neyman-Scott point processes applied to rainfall
   simulation is investigated. Extensive calculations showed that in
   estimating the parameters by the method of moments the choice of the
   aggregation scale of the data significantly affects the estimates of the
   continuous process parameters. Besides, when equations at different
   aggregation scales are employed, the optimisation procedure may fail if
   the selected scales are too close. An alternative estimation procedure
   is suggested, based on the scale of fluctuation of the observed process.
   The estimates obtained with the proposed procedure are at least as good
   as the better estimates obtained with the procedure using different
   scales, both in terms of reproduction of the second order statistics and
   extreme values for different aggregation scales, as shown by Monte Carlo
   simulations. On the whole, the use of the procedure based on fluctuation
   scale appears to be a valuable alternative in the estimation of the
   parameters of the Neyman-Scott processes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title = {{A comparison of downscaled and raw GCM output: implications for climate
   change scenarios in the San Juan River basin, Colorado}},

Abstract = {{The fundamental rationale for statistical downscaling is that the raw
   outputs of climate change experiments from General Circulation Models
   (GCMs) are an inadequate basis for assessing the effects of climate
   change on land-surface processes at regional scales. This is because the
   spatial resolution of GCMs is too coarse to resolve important sub-grid
   scale processes (most notably those pertaining to the hydrological
   cycle) and because GCM output is often unreliable at individual and
   sub-grid box scales. By establishing empirical relationships between
   grid-box scale circulation indices (such as atmospheric vorticity and
   divergence) and sub-grid scale surface predictands (such as
   precipitation), statistical downscaling has been proposed as a practical
   means of bridging this spatial difference. This study compared three
   sets of current and future rainfall-runoff scenarios. The scenarios were
   constructed using: (1) statistically downscaled GCM output; (2) raw GCM
   output; and (3) raw GCM output corrected for elevational biases.
   Atmospheric circulation indices and humidity variables were extracted
   from the output of the UK Meteorological Office coupled ocean-atmosphere
   GCM (HadCM2) in order to downscale daily precipitation and temperature
   series for the Animas River in the San Juan River basin, Colorado.
   Significant differences arose between the modelled snowpack and how
   regimes of the three future climate scenarios. Overall, the raw GCM
   output suggests larger reductions in winter/spring snowpack and summer
   runoff than the downscaling, relative to current conditions. Further
   research is required to determine the generality of the water resource
   implications for other regions, GCM outputs and downscaled scenarios.

Abstract = {{Reliable estimates of Row statistics are needed for water resources
   management and hood forecasting purposes. However, the location of
   gaging station seldom coincides with the site of interest, or the
   available record becomes too short to make meaningful statistical
   inferences. Thus regional regression models, such as power-form model of
   Thomas and Benson (Thomas, D.M., Benson, M.A., 1970, Generalization of
   streamflow characteristics from drainage-basin characteristics, US
   Geological Survey, Water Supply Paper, 1975), which relate regional
   physiographic characteristics to streamflow statistics are developed to
   estimate the streamflow statistics where data are needed but not
   available. Depending upon the postulated model type and nature of the
   data, there are several ways of estimating model parameters. This paper
   compares the performances of nine methods of estimating parameters of
   the power-form model that expresses flood quantile as a function of
   basin area. The performance of each method is assessed based upon its
   quantile prediction ability from an ungaged site in the region. A
   jacknife procedure is used to simulate the ungaged site condition in the
   region. Based upon a case study using the hydrologic and physiographic
   data from Quebec, Canada, nonlinear models outperformed the
   log-linearized (or Linear) models. Despite the differences in the
   parameter estimation techniques and suitability for different data type,
   the quantile prediction abilities of all of the linear models were not
   different from each other. Most of the linear models had higher bias and
   higher root mean squared error and they under-predicted hoods from large
   basins. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A simple GIS-linked model for groundwater nitrate transport has been
   developed in the IDRISI GIS environment. The transport model, based on
   advection transport only, is directly incorporated into a GIS subroutine
   using the Pascal computing language. This model requires less data than
   classical approaches and provides a user-friendly model environment. The
   GIS-model was tested on a 20 km(2) hydrogeologic catchment, particularly
   vulnerable to agricultural nitrate pollution. The model was coupled with
   an unsaturated zone transport model (AgriFlux), which simulates water
   and nitrate fluxes leaving the root zone. The results indicated that the
   simulated nitrate concentrations were in good agreement with measured
   values. In order to compare the GIS-linked model with a more complete
   model, simulations were also performed with MT3D-MODFLOW. The
   similarities between the results of the two models confirm the validity
   of the GIS-linked model. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Leaf litter is an important source of natural dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) in forested catchments. Rainwater percolating through fresh litter
   obtains higher concentrations of DOC and colour than from older forest
   floor material and organic soils. Chemical characterisation using DOC
   fractionation and tests of biodegradability show that natural litter
   percolates contain significant fractions of coloured and highly
   refractory hydrophobic acids (humic substances) and variable fractions
   of biodegradable compounds. Deciduous leaf litter imparts high DOC
   concentrations in the autumn, while coniferous litter and organic soils
   release DOC more evenly. Leaching from fresh deciduous litter may
   explain the seasonality in the concentration of DOC in discharge from
   forested catchments. Countrywide Norwegian data show very poor
   relationships between occurrences of mires in the catchment of lakes and
   water colour. High concentrations of DOC may occur in lakes where the
   catchment has a high proportion of surface runoff due to thin or
   impermeable soils or swamp areas. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Fuzzy rule-based modeling is applied to the prediction of regional
   droughts (characterized by the modified Palmer index, PMDI) using two
   forcing inputs, El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and large scale
   atmospheric circulation patterns (CPs) in a typical Great Plains state,
   Nebraska. Although, there is significant relationship between
   simultaneous monthly CP, lagged Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and
   PMDI in Nebraska, the weakness of the correlations, the dependence
   between CP and SOI and the relatively short data set limit the
   applicability of statistical modeling for prediction. Due to the above
   difficulties, a fuzzy rule-based approach is presented to predict PMDI
   from monthly frequencies of daily CP types and lagged prior SOIs. The
   fuzzy rules are defined and calibrated using a subset called the
   learning set of the observed time series of premises and PMDI response.
   Then, another subset, the validation set is used to check how the
   application of fuzzy rules reproduces the observed PMDI. In all its
   eight climate divisions and Nebraska itself the fuzzy rule-based
   technique using the joint forcing of CP and SOI, is able to learn the
   high variability and persistence of PMDI and results in almost perfect
   reproduction of the empirical frequency distributions. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Being able to predict the duration of the critical period (CP) and hence
   the precise mode of behaviour of a reservoir system prior to analysis is
   advantageous because then the input data interval can be selected to
   match the requirement. In this sense, purely over-year systems (CP >> 12
   months) can be adequately analysed using annual time-series data,
   whereas for purely within-year systems (CP << 12 months), only the
   ``critical{''} 12 months in the data record need be considered. These
   are the two extremes; in reality most reservoirs exhibit a mixture of
   both behaviours and to capture these, time series data at monthly (or
   shorter) time scale are required. In this paper, we present results of
   Monte Carlo simulation experiments investigating the CP of within-year
   and over-year reservoir systems and its relationship with the currently
   used test for discriminating between the two patterns of reservoir
   behaviour. Based on data from two different climatic regions, the
   results show that the current test is incomplete without incorporating
   other characteristics of the reservoir storage-yield-reliability
   problem. A procedure for incorporating these other characteristics is
   demonstrated and suggestions are offered as to how the study could be
   extended. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The study area, the Manawatu region of New Zealand, covers approximately
   4200 km(2) and contains numerous aquifers in unconsolidated Quaternary
   sedimentary formations. Most of the 5000 bores are shallow, with over
   75\% being less than 50 m. Of concern, is that 20\% of bores in the
   south tap groundwater with a nitrate-nitrogen concentration above the
   drinking water standard (11.3 mg/l). An effective regional vulnerability
   assessment was therefore developed to mitigate this problem.
   While four factors largely control aquifer vulnerability in the study
   area, this paper focuses on developing a regional rainfall recharge
   model. Percolating rainwater is the major transporting agent for
   contaminants through soil and unsaturated zone.
   Mean annual recharge was calculated at each rainfall station throughout
   the study area using the Monte Carlo technique to randomise soil
   moisture parameters and approximate the variability of soils. These
   point estimates of recharge were then modelled spatially to produce a
   `recharge surface'.
   Good agreement between the modelled and actual groundwater levels was
   obtained. Likewise, the regional recharge surface is consistent with the
   physical processes and the expected pattern.
   Uncertainty of recharge estimation is expressed as the standard
   deviation of the mean annual recharge resulting from the Monte Carlo
   modelling. Estimates of both recharge and uncertainty are presented as
   readily assimilated colour-coded maps which can be used by resource
   planners and other laypersons. This methodology is considered
   appropriate for other non-arid areas with limited soil and groundwater
   data coverage. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the review and modification of the
   structure of the conceptual rainfall-runoff model known as the
   probability-distributed interacting storage capacity (PDISC) model. The
   significance of the fundamental assumption of the equal-storage
   redistribution mode used in this model is critically investigated by
   adopting a more general linear-storage redistribution mode. The
   investigation is performed using the daily data of six catchments. The
   results reveal that the original assumption of the equal-storage
   redistribution mode may not be an optimum in some catchments.
   Further development of the water-balance module of the PDISC model is
   also explored. The surface-runoff generation mechanism of the model is
   modified by incorporating into the model structure a quick-runoff
   component. The results suggest that this modification can significantly
   improve the performance of the model. The results of the PDISC model are
   also compared with that of another established lumped conceptual
   rainfall-runoff model known as the soil moisture accounting and routing
   procedure (SMAR). Neither of the two models has worked consistently
   better than the other under all situations. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Complex demodulation of monthly precipitation data is used to determine
   temporal changes in the decadal averages of the annual precipitation
   cycle. Good spatial coherence is found between sites from as far apart
   as Scotland, western Ireland and southern Sweden. The annual
   precipitation cycle is found to have been unusually late in the 1870s
   and early 1900s and to have been noticeably early in the 1860s and
   1890s. Fluctuations of up to 13 weeks are found in the timing of the
   annual precipitation cycle, as recorded at Kew, during the last 300
   years. Complex demodulation provides a technique to quantify annual
   climate changes and hence to provide a quantitative context in which
   detection of anthropogenic-induced changes to the annual climate signal
   can be assessed. Ten percent changes in the decadal averages of the
   amplitude of the annual precipitation cycle and in precipitation amounts
   are found. Although precipitation in the British Isles is often cited as
   rising, no persistent increases are observed in this study. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The range of field estimates of permeabilities in rocks of the Atikokan
   Research Area (ARA), Canada, has been reduced by calibrating a
   groundwater flow model of the ARA. The flow model was calibrated to the
   recharge component of the water balance and to measured freshwater heads
   in boreholes. A good match between field and simulated recharge, and
   between measured and simulated heads was obtained with two different
   permeability-depth distributions that differed by up to two orders of
   magnitude in places. Solute transport simulation of the distributions of
   total dissolved solids (TDS), chlorides (Cl) and oxygen-18 (O-18) in
   groundwater in the area was performed to further refine the permeability
   estimates. Vertical average linear groundwater velocities from the
   calibrated flow model were used in one-dimensional solute transport
   models of the system to generate depth-concentration profiles of TDS, Cl
   and O-18. Recharge-, midline- and discharge-area models of both the
   fracture zones and the rock mass were employed. The midline area is the
   narrow zone that separates the recharge (downward flow) area from the
   discharge (upward flow) area. Groundwater flow is essentially horizontal
   in the midline area. ``Envelopes{''} formed by the simulated profiles
   that were created with the velocities of one simulation case more
   tightly enclosed the field data (TDS, Cl, O-18) than those of another
   simulation case, indicating that velocities of the former simulation
   case better represent the hydrodynamics of the real system. The models
   demonstrate that the scatter of TDS, Cl and O-18 field data for the ARA
   is consistent with the groundwater flow model predictions and can be
   explained by the complexity arising from different hydraulic regimes
   (recharge, midline, discharge) and hydrogeologic environments (fracture
   zones, rock mass) of the regional flow system. Solute transport
   simulation of hydrochemical constituents can aid in refining and
   constraining permeabilities in large-scale groundwater systems. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Threshold runoff is the amount of excess rainfall accumulated during a
   given time period over a basin that is just enough to cause flooding at
   the outlet of the draining stream. Threshold runoff estimates are
   indicators of maximal sustainable surface runoff for a given catchment,
   and are thus an essential component of flash flood warning systems. Used
   in conjunction with soil moisture accounting models and areal rainfall
   data, they form the basis of the US National Weather Service (NWS) flash
   flood watch/warning program. As part of their modernization and
   enhancement effort, the NWS determined that improved flash flood
   guidance and thus improved threshold runoff estimation is needed across
   the United States, with spatial resolution commensurate to that afforded
   by the WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radars. In this work, Geographic Information
   Systems (GIS) and digital terrain elevation databases have been used to
   develop a national system for determining threshold runoff. Estimates of
   threshold runoff an presented for several locations in the United
   States, including large portions of the states of Iowa, Oklahoma, and
   California, and using several options in computing threshold runoff.
   Analysis of the results indicates the importance of channel geometry in
   flash flood applications. Larger threshold runoff estimates were
   computed in Oklahoma (average value of 34 mm) than in Iowa (14 mm) or
   California (9.5 mm). Comparisons of the threshold runoff estimates
   produced by the GIS procedure with those based on manually computed unit
   hydrographs for the selected catchments are shown as a preliminary
   measure of the accuracy of the procedure. Differences of up to about 15
   mm for hourly rainfall durations were obtained for basins larger than 50
   km(2). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil water collected from suction lysimeters and wick samplers buried in
   the unsaturated zone of a sand and gravel aquifer and extracted from
   soil cores were analyzed for stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope values.
   Soil water isotopic values differed among the three sampling methods in
   most cases. However, because each sampling method collected different
   fractions of the total soil-water reservoir, the isotopic differences
   indicated that the soil water at a given depth and time was isotopically
   heterogeneous. This heterogeneity reflects the presence of relatively
   more and less mobile components of soil water. Isotopic results from
   three field tests indicated that 95-100\% of the water collected from
   wick samplers was mobile soil water while samples from suction
   lysimeters and cores were mixtures of more and less mobile soil water.
   Suction lysimeter samples contained a higher proportion of more mobile
   water (15-95\%) than samples from cores (5-80\%) at the same depth. The
   results of this study indicate that, during infiltration events, soil
   water collected with wick samplers is more representative of the mobile
   soil water that is likely to recharge ground water during or soon after
   the event than soil water from suction lysimeters or cores. Published by

Abstract = {{In this study, we develop an axisymmetric groundwater flow model to
   numerically simulate the hydraulic head loss across the flowmeter during
   a flowmeter test. Using it, we investigate the influence of flowmeter
   induced hydraulic head losses and filter pack effects on the calculated
   drawdown distributions in the vicinity of the pumping well and on the
   flowmeter test estimates of layer horizontal hydraulic conductivity,
   K-i, in three different aquifer-well systems: a homogeneous aquifer; a
   homogeneous aquifer with a filter pack surrounding the well; and a
   two-layer aquifer with a filter pack surrounding the well. We confirm
   that the K-i estimates can be significantly biased due to the head loss
   across the flowmeter. This head loss induces a non-uniform flow pattern
   in the vicinity of the well, which violates the horizontal flow
   assumption invoked by flowmeter test interpretation methodologies. The
   effect of the hydraulic head losses alone (i.e. no cross-flow through
   the filter pack) can lead to K-i estimation errors as great as a factor
   of three even in a homogeneous aquifer. The coupled effect of hydraulic
   head losses and cross-flow through the filter pack can lead to K-i
   estimation errors of up to a factor of 10 or greater. In actual
   flowmeter tests, these head losses can be reduced by increasing the
   annulus of the flowmeter, by operating the flowmeter without a packer,
   or by choosing a small enough pumping rate. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The acidification of many streams and lakes that has occurred in
   southern Norway during several decades is to a large extent caused by
   acid deposition. However, in coastal areas deposition events with high
   loading of sea-salts may result in increased acidity and aluminium
   concentration in the discharge. Since such episodes are difficult to
   predict and usually of short duration, the aluminium chemistry during
   such episodes has so far not been evaluated in detail. In January 1993,
   during monitoring of streams in the Lake Terjevann catchment, the area
   was exposed to an extraordinary high sea-salt loading. The Cl-
   concentration in the stream water more than doubled (reaching about 900
   mu eq/l), the labile inorganic aluminium (Ali) concentration almost
   quadrupled (reaching about 33 and 18 mu M in the two streams), and the
   relative increase in the Al3+ concentration was even higher. It took 3-4
   months until the Al-i concentration and almost a year until the Cl-
   concentration returned to pre-event levels. Simple equilibria with
   minerals such as gibbsite, jurbanite, kaolinite/halloysite or imogolite
   do not control aluminium concentration in the discharge from these
   catchments. Retention of Na+ more than compensated for the desorption of
   Al3+. The results strongly indicate that cation exchange in the organic
   soil layers was essential in controlling the aluminium chemistry in the
   stream waters especially during high flow. Similar, but less pronounced,
   effects of the sea-salt episode were seen at the Birkenes catchment
   about 37 km inland from Lake Terjevann. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper concerns contaminant transport in aquifers comprising
   fractured porous formations. It is considered that the aquifer subject
   to contamination is composed of macro-blocks, which embed two sets of
   macro-fractures, Each macro-block incorporates numerous micro-blocks of
   low permeability, which embed micro-fractures. Therefore, the basic
   conceptual model, used in this study, is a triple-porosity
   two-dimensional model.
   It is shown that five dimensionless parameters govern contaminant
   transport in the triple-porosity domain. However, a group of eight
   so-called practical parameters is convenient to be used for
   consideration of possible scenarios. From this group, major effects of
   contaminant diffusion into the micro-blocks are attributed to the
   density of micro-fractures and porosity of the microblocks. Coefficient
   of diffusivity of contaminant into the micro-block is also a significant
   parameter. Its effective value increases due to the presence of vertical
   fractures, which do not transfer contaminant by advection, and it is
   dependent on the tortuosity of the micro-block material.
   Simulations of various possible scenarios were carried out by solving
   the basic dimensionless equations developed in the present study. The
   solutions were obtained by a combination of analytical and numerical
   solutions. The simulations indicate that at a comparatively high
   porosity of the micro-blocks, of the order 10(-1), the effect of
   contaminant diffusion into the microblocks can be approximated as a
   retardation phenomenon, similar to contaminant adsorption. An increase
   of the fracture density reduces that retardation effect. If the
   micro-block porosity is comparatively low, of the order 10(-3), then
   contaminant diffusion into the micro-blocks changes the shape of the
   breakthrough curves, which are ended with very long tails. This
   phenomenon is reduced by the increase of the fracture density. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{To reduce systematic errors in radar rainfall data used for operational
   hydrologic forecasting, the precipitation estimation stream in the
   National Weather Service (NWS) uses procedures that estimate mean field
   bias in real time. Being a multiplicative correction over a very large
   area, bias adjustment has a huge impact, particularly on volumetric
   estimation of rainwater, and hence performance of the procedure is
   extremely important to quantitative hydrologic forecasting using radar
   rainfall data. In this paper, we describe a new procedure far real-time
   estimation of mean field bias in WSR-88D (Weather Surveillance
   Radar-1988 Doppler version) rainfall products. Based largely on
   operational experience of the existing procedures in NWS, the proposed
   procedure is intended to be unbiased, parsimonious, and intuitive. To
   evaluate the procedure, true validation is performed using hourly rain
   gage and WSR-88D rainfall data from Tulsa and Twin Lakes, Oklahoma. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates how the Gyasi-Agyei-Willgoose hybrid model for
   point processes could be regionalised for daily rainfall disaggregation
   using limited high resolution data within a region of interest. Their
   model is a product of the binary non-randomised Bartlett-Lewis
   rectangular pulse model and a lognormal autoregressive model used as a
   jitter. The computationally efficient multinormal approximation to
   parameter uncertainty is used to group the monthly parameter values of
   the binary model. For central Queensland, Australia, it has been
   established that the parameters of cell origins and the duration of the
   rectangular pulse of the binary model could have constant values for all
   months. Second harmonic Fourier series is used to represent the seasonal
   variation of the parameter governing the storm lifetime. The storm
   arrival rate is a function of the daily dry probability and the other
   parameters. Additive properties of random variables with finite
   variances were used to scale down the daily mean and variance of the
   historical data to the simulation timescale, values required by the
   jitter model. The results of using observed daily rainfall statistics to
   capture sub-daily statistics by the regionalised model are very
   encouraging. The model is therefore a valuable tool for disaggregating
   daily rainfall data. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It has been demonstrated that local surface tension depression due to
   the presence of an insoluble surfactant, myristyl alcohol, can result in
   capillary pressure gradients that cause significant flow in unsaturated
   porous media. We hypothesized that the effects of a soluble surfactant,
   butanol, would differ from those of myristyl alcohol despite the fact
   that both give a similar reduction in the surface tension of water. We
   investigated this hypothesis through a series of horizontal column
   experiments and unsaturated flow modeling. We found that both
   surfactants induced water flow from regions of high surfactant
   concentration to regions of low concentration but that the shapes of the
   resultant moisture content profiles were fundamentally different.
   Because surface tension depression from myristyl alcohol was confined to
   the original source zone, we were able to simulate the system using a
   standard unsaturated flow model by assigning separate sets of hydraulic
   functions to the initially clean and source zones. Modeling showed that
   the redistribution of water due to the initial surfactant-induced
   capillary pressure gradient created moisture content induced capillary
   pressure gradients which acted to balance the system over time. The
   moisture content profile within the butanol system indicated a
   propagation of the zone of reduced surface tension. Because the surface
   tension of water is a function of solute concentration,
   surfactant-induced capillary pressure gradients are expected to remain
   and influence the flow system as long as concentration gradients exist.

Abstract = {{This work presents a two-well method to evaluate transverse dispersion
   coefficients for tracer tests conducted in a radially convergent flow
   field. A two-dimensional mathematical model is derived and applied to
   illustrate how transverse dispersion influences tracer transport in a
   convergent radial tracer test. A curve-fitting procedure is proposed to
   evaluate simultaneously the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities.
   A hypothetical experiment is used to demonstrate the application of the
   method. The proposed method allows one to evaluate the transverse
   dispersivity from field tracer tests, as long as the observed
   breakthrough curves at the pumping well and an observing well are known.

Title = {{Measurement of relative permittivity in sandy soils using TDR,
   capacitance and theta probes: comparison, including the effects of bulk
   soil electrical conductivity}},

Abstract = {{Measurement of the apparent dielectric permittivity of soils (dielectric
   constant) is becoming a popular way of estimating soil volumetric water
   content. This paper focuses on the measurement of apparent permittivity
   in four sandy soils using; time domain reflectometry (TDR), a surface
   capacitance insertion probe (SCIP) and a Theta probe. Measurement of the
   apparent permittivity using the SCIP and Theta probe are compared with
   the apparent permittivity measured using the TDR.
   Calibration of such instrumentation has remained relatively empirical
   following the engineering approximation presented by Topp et al. (Topp,
   G.C., Davies, J.L., Anan, A.P., 1980. Electromagnetic determination of
   soil water content: measurements in coaxial transmission lines. Water
   Res. Research 16, 574-582.). The refractive index model proposed by
   Whalley (Whalley, W.R., 1993. Considerations on the use of time domain
   reflectometry (TDR) for measuring soil water content. J. Soil Sci.
   44(1), 1-9.) based on that of Birchak et al. (Birchak, J.R., Gardner,
   C.Z.G., Hipp, J.E., Victor, J.M., 1974. High dielectric constant
   microwave probes for sensing soil moisture. Proc. IEEE 62(1), 93-98.) is
   investigated as a means of gaining some physical understanding of the
   relative contributions of the different dielectric components in soils.
   Predictions made by the model are tested against results using multiple
   linear regression. The predictions agree well with the observed
   measurements. Interelectrode conductivity is found to contribute
   significantly to the apparent permittivity measured using the SCIP and
   to a lesser extent the TDR but not the Theta probe. Inclusion of
   inter-electrode conductivity in regression analysis improved results.
   The Theta probe was found to overestimate the apparent permittivity of
   the soil by similar to 1.5 when compared with TDR results. It is
   suggested that this may be the result of compaction of the soil close to
   the electrodes, coupled with a strong bias in the sensitivity of the
   probe to the region very close to the central electrode. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{We report Cl-36 determinations for groundwaters in the major confined
   aquifer, the Mereenie Sandstone, in the Amadeus Basin, in arid central
   Australia. Groundwaters at the synclinal margins of the Amadeus Basin
   have Cl-36 ratios, Cl-36/Cl, averaging about 176 x 10(-15). These
   groundwaters have radiocarbon contents ranging from 6 to 39\% modem
   carbon, suggesting that they might ``average out{''} episodic recharge
   processes over the last 30,000 years. Deep within the Basin,
   groundwaters in the Mereenie Sandstone at Palm Valley sampled from
   petroleum exploration drilling, have Cl-36 ratios ranging from 8 x
   10(-15) to 99 x 10(-15). The average chlorinity of the deep groundwater
   samples is up to double that of the synclinal margin waters, indicating
   some addition of chloride in the aquifer. Even so, the groundwater
   residence times are implied to be about four hundred thousand years.
   These Mereenie Sandstone groundwaters are sourced several hundred metres
   below ground level, and their minimum flow path is 40-50 km from the
   recharge zone at the margin of the Basin. This gives an average flow
   rate of 0.1 m/a, in accord with previous hydraulic flow modelling which
   indicated that groundwater travel times in the Mereenie Sandstone are
   slow and uneven. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic changes associated with the 17 January 1995 Kobe Earthquake
   occurred in Awajishima Island very close to the epicenter. These
   included: (1) large drop of water table in the mountainous area; (2)
   rapid increase of discharge along active faults; and (3) change of
   chemistry of discharged water. A simple horizontal flow model was
   constructed to explain the observed changes; and optimal sets of
   specific yield and the change of hydraulic conductivity were estimated.
   Results suggest that this model can explain the observed phenomena
   consistently. The hydraulic conductivity is estimated to increase at
   least five times than that before the Earthquake; however, quantitative
   measurement of the increase of discharge just after the earthquake would
   constrain better the change of the hydraulic conductivity. The specific
   yield of the unconfined aquifer is between 0.3 and 1.7\% depending on
   the assumed recharge rate but independent of the assumed depth to the
   impermeable basement. The change in chemical composition of the
   discharged water could be explained by the upward movement of deeper
   water due to the invasion of saltwater into the aquifer. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{A snow component has been developed for the distributed hydrological
   model, DIY, using an approach that sequentially evaluates the behaviour
   of different functions as they are implemented in the model. The
   evaluation is performed using multiobjective functions to ensure that
   the internal structure of the model is correct. The development of the
   model, using a subcatchment in the Caimgorm Mountains in Scotland,
   demonstrated that the degree-day model can be enhanced for hydroclimatic
   conditions typical of those found in Scotland, without increasing
   meteorological data requirements. An important element of the snow model
   is a function to account for wind re-distribution. This causes large
   accumulations of snow in small pockets, which are shown to be important
   in sustaining baseflows in the rivers during the late spring and early
   summer, long after the snowpack has melted from the bulk of the
   catchment. The importance of the wind function would not have been
   identified using a single objective function of total streamflow to
   evaluate the model behaviour. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the factors controlling the variations of heavy
   isotope contents of 57 rain events collected throughout the rain forest
   regions of Cameroon, Central Africa, during the great rainy season
   (August-November) of 1994. Our data display a wide range of values, from
   +1.69 to -10.80 parts per thousand for O-18 and from +23.2 to -85.5
   parts per thousand for H-2, The data follow closely the global meteoric
   water line suggesting that rain formation processes occurred under
   isotopic equilibrium conditions between both the condensate and the
   corresponding vapour. This also indicates that the observed heavy
   isotope contents have not been altered by evaporation during the descent
   of raindrops to the ground.
   The low heavy-isotope contents observed for some precipitation events
   are assumed to be controlled by the amount of rainfall and/or by the low
   condensation temperature. The former effect is related to the northward
   passage of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) over the region
   under study, whereas the second effect is linked to high altitudes of
   condensation. Moreover, the latitudinal variations of the weighted mean
   O-18 contents indicates that in coastal areas (0-230 km inland from the
   Atlantic coast) the stable isotopic compositions of precipitation are
   controlled by a continuous extraction from the atmospheric reservoir of
   vapour as rains according to the Rayleigh distillation model, whereas at
   distances > 230 km, recycling of continental moisture is thought to have
   influenced the isotopic compositions of rains. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Models of energy and mass exchange between vegetation canopies and the
   atmosphere usually include some formulation of the bulk boundary layer
   resistance (Rb or the related parameter kB(-1)) to describe the effects
   of molecular diffusion occurring near the leaf and soil surfaces.
   Present formulations of kB(-1) are either empirical expressions or are
   physically based models derived from a K-theory approach. However,
   K-theory does not describe the observed counter gradient how within
   canopies and the empirical expressions usually lump both canopy and soil
   effects into a single surface resistance (single source approach). For
   areas of partial canopy cover, single source formulations have been
   difficult to formulate with any certainty and often do not agree with
   observations. This study uses `localized near-field' (LNF) Lagrangian
   theory to develop a model of kB(-1) (for heat transfer) for the
   vegetation component of a dual source model and for the combined effects
   of canopy and soil in a single source approach. The present model also
   uses a physically based, one-dimensional, analytical model to describe
   the influence of canopy structure and density upon the within-canopy far
   field diffusivity and Lagrangian time scale which are central to the LNF
   Lagrangian theory. The canopy turbulence model is designed for arbitrary
   foliage structure and density and kB(-1) is defined in terms of heat and
   momentum fluxes rather than the more conventional logarithm of the ratio
   of the momentum and thermal roughness lengths. The resulting kB(-1)
   model is used for sensitivity studies of kB(-1) for canopies only (i.e.
   no soil contribution) and for the coupled canopy-soil system (i.e. a
   single source model). Results indicate that foliage density (Drag Area
   Index or Leaf Area Index), wind speed, leaf size, possible sheltering
   effects, and, to a lesser extent, the vertical foliage distribution and
   the vertical variation of the temperature difference between the foliage
   and the near-leaf air space can influence kB(-1). For the single source
   model the soil boundary layer resistance was found to be significant for
   areas of partial canopy cover. In spite of the relative complexity of
   the full LNF model of kB(-1), a simple expression that varies smoothly
   between bare soil and full canopy cover is developed that captures much
   of the modeled and observed variation in kB(-1) for the single source
   approach. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Geophysical surveys have been carried our on the East Frisian island of
   Spiekeroog at the German North Sea coast in 1996. So-called ``freshwater
   lenses{''}, lying on top of saltwater-saturated layers because of their
   lower density, provide most of the freshwater supply on the Frisian
   Islands. The major goal of the present study is to show the
   possibilities of a joint application of surface electrical resistivity
   soundings and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) for the hydrogeological
   investigation of the island. It is shown that a comprehensive
   interpretation of large-scale GPR-profiling data in a sandy aquifer
   provides valuable hydrogeological information, especially if there is wt
   any other information available, such as from boreholes or groundwater
   measuring points. Applying the techniques of surface electrical
   resistivity and ground penetrating radar jointly, we were able to
   construct a groundwater contour map for the entire island of Spiekeroog.
   In addition, we were able to delineate hydrogeologically important
   changes in grain size and stratigraphical features and to indicate
   temporal changes of the spatial extent of the freshwater reservoir in
   comparison to earlier (less complete) investigations. Finally, we
   located an area, previously unknown, in the:eastern part of the island
   where precipitation appears to be developing a substantial new
   freshwater lens. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Incomplete sampling leads to uncertainty in the detailed 3-D
   distribution of conductivity in every subsurface formation,
   Stochastic/geostatistical techniques are being increasingly used to
   generate alternative fine scale 3-D realizations of subsurface
   parameters that are consistent with the available data. Ideally, an
   assessment of aquifer response uncertainty is provided by processing a
   large number of fine scale realizations through a groundwater modeling
   program. To avoid excessive CPU times the fine scale realizations are
   often averaged to a coarse resolution for fast flow and transport
   simulation. The problem with this approach is that the aquifer response
   is often sensitive to fine scale heterogeneities and such coarse flow
   models may lead to erroneous results. An alternative approach is
   proposed in this paper. The coarse scale responses are used to rank the
   realizations, i.e. identify low and high response realizations. A
   limited number of fine scale realizations are then processed through the
   flow and transport simulator. Thus, aquifer response uncertainty can be
   analyzed at the fine scale with less computational effort, The proposed
   method is applied to a hypothetical aquifer, which is characterized by
   variogram statistics derived for the Columbus aquifer, Mississippi. The
   value of ranking is shown by comparing the approximate uncertainty with
   the reference fine scale aquifer response. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Computer programs of rainfall-runoff models, such as HEC-1 and other
   related computer programs, utilize a set of algorithms that represent
   the effects of catchment subarea runoff, network link hydrograph flow
   routing, and detention/retention basin hydrograph routing. By
   subdividing a watershed into numerous subareas, and connecting the
   subareas by a network of links, a link-node model representation of the
   watershed is constructed. Each of the algorithms computationally solves
   a prescribed relation by subdividing storm duration into unit
   periods-of-time of constant duration (e.g. 5 min). Such link-node models
   are so flexible and comprehensive that one might conjecture that the
   algorithms and rules of linkage are sufficient to simulate any storm
   runoff problem that can be formally expressed in the model. In contrast,
   the single-area unit hydrograph (UH)) modeling approach represents a
   watershed as a single subarea, and utilizes a single UH to represent all
   of the effects being modeled by a link-node model. The mathematical
   underpinnings of the single-area model UH are typically described in the
   literature as being a ``black box{''}. In this paper, a mathematical
   formalization of link-node models can be developed with the computer
   program HEC-1 and the related systems will be introduced. The
   formalization is then used to establish, and also dispel, some
   perceptions regarding application of such link-node models. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{This paper considers the modelling of lowland river reaches which
   contain complex within-reach hydrological interactions. It is clear that
   river and floodplain flow are the most important processes in terms of
   flood modelling in lowland systems, although there are often important
   lateral inflows from catchments and hillslopes bounding the floodplain
   and from interactions between the river and the floodplain, which can
   all affect the propagation of the flood wave. Previous models have often
   either considered a complex representation of the fluvial processes with
   no representation of the hydrological inflows into the reach (Bates,
   P.D., Anderson, M.G., Price, D.A., Hardy, R.J., Smith, C.N., 1996.
   Analysis and development of hydraulic models for floodplain hows. In:
   Anderson, M.G., Walling, D.E., Bates P.D. (Eds.), Floodplain Processes.
   Wiley, Chichester, pp. 215-254), or have simulated a range of catchment
   processes with a poor representation of the river and floodplain (Abbot,
   M.B., Bathurst, J.C., Cunge, J.A., O'Connell, P.E., Rasmussen, J., 1986.
   An introduction to the European Hydrological System-Systeme Hydrologique
   Europeen, SHE, 2. Structure of a physically based, distributed modelling
   system. Journal of Hydrology, 87, 61-77). Hence, this paper develops a
   modelling approach based on a two-dimensional finite element hydraulic
   model of river and floodplain flow, which is linked to a series of
   simple hydrological models that simulate catchment runoff, surface and
   subsurface hillslope runoff, and floodplain infiltration. Simulations
   show that the model is able to predict flood hydrographs for a series of
   flood events, under a range of different hydrological conditions, down a
   reach of the River Severn, UK. Furthermore, the comparison of results
   from simulations using hydrological representations of different degrees
   of complexity suggest that there are restrictions on the necessary
   complexity of the hydrological components depending on the application
   of the model and the available validation data. Simple approaches to the
   reach scale hydrology may be sufficient if only the bulk outflow
   hydrograph is required by the user, however more complex spatially and
   temporally distributed models appear to be required if predictions of
   the hood inundation extent are desired. The simulations raise the issue
   of the application of distributed models and attempt to provide a
   framework for future research. The results suggest that there is a need
   for the validation of the internal predictions of distributed models of
   flood flow, and suggests a need for field data of river and floodplain
   interactions within long lowland river reaches. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A Markov model of order 1 may be used to describe the occurrence of wet
   and dry days in Nigeria. Such models feature two parameter sets; P-01 to
   characterise the probability of a wet day following a dry day and P-11
   to characterise the probability of a wet day following a wet day. The
   model parameter sets, when estimated from historical records, are
   characterised by a distinctive seasonal behaviour. However, the
   comparison of this seasonal behaviour between rainfall stations is
   hampered by the noise reflecting the high variability of parameters on
   successive days. The first part of this article is concerned with
   methods for smoothing these inherently noisy parameter sets. Smoothing
   has been approached using Fourier series, averaging techniques, or a
   combination thereof. It has been found that different methods generally
   perform well with respect to estimation of the average number of wet
   events and the frequency duration curves of wet and dry events.
   Parameterisation of the P-01 parameter set is more successful than the
   P-11 in view of the relatively small number of wet events lasting two or
   more days. The second part of the article is concerned with describing
   the regional variation in smoothed parameter sets. There is a systematic
   variation in the P-01 parameter set as one moves northwards. In
   contrast, there is limited regional variation in the P-11 set. Although
   this regional variation in P-01 appears to be related to the gradual
   movement of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone, the contrasting
   behaviour of the two parameter sets is difficult to explain on physical
   grounds. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to assess the runoff characteristics of pipeflow in mountainous
   watersheds, precipitation and amount of pipeflow were measured for 3
   years at a forested mountainous watershed in the central part of Japan.
   Similar changes in runoff characteristics were observed for two pipes
   over the study period; the maximum discharge rate of pipeflow increased,
   the recession hydrograph of pipeflow became steep, and the duration of
   pipeflow discharge became shorter. However, the changes of runoff
   characteristics had no significant effect on relationships between total
   rainfall and total discharge from pipes. Based on observations of
   sediment discharge from soil pipes, it was suggested that the sediment
   discharge from these soil pipes caused the changes of runoff
   characteristics of pipeflow. Moreover, in order to clarify the effects
   of pipeflow on streamflow, simultaneous measurements of pipeflow and
   streamflow were conducted at the same watershed. Results showed that the
   water discharge phenomena from this watershed can be classified into
   three stages based on the soil pipes which contribute the water
   discharge: (1) under small amounts of rainfall, water discharge occurs
   only at the spring situated at the watershed exit; (2) as the magnitude
   of rainfall increases, water comes out from a pipe located at 6 m
   upstream from the watershed exit; and (3) under the heaviest rainfall,
   additional discharge occurs from a group of pipes located 10 m upstream
   from the watershed exit. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An approach is described for estimation of baseflow parameters of the
   ARNO model, using historical baseflow recession sequences extracted from
   daily streamflow records. This approach allows four of the model
   parameters to be estimated without rainfall data, and effectively
   facilitates partitioning of the parameter estimation procedure so that
   parsimonious search procedures can be used to estimate the remaining
   storm response parameters separately. Three methods of optimization are
   evaluated for estimation of four baseflow parameters. These methods are
   the downhill Simplex (S), Simulated Annealing combined with the Simplex
   method (SA) and Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE). These estimation
   procedures are explored in conjunction with four objective functions:
   (1) ordinary least squares; (2) ordinary least squares with Box-Cox
   transformation; (3) ordinary least squares on prewhitened residuals; (4)
   ordinary least squares applied to prewhitened with Box-Cox
   transformation of residuals. The effects of changing the seed random
   generator for both SA and SCE methods are also explored, as are the
   effects of the bounds of the parameters. Although all schemes converge
   to the same values of the objective function, SCE method was found to be
   less sensitive to these issues than both the SA and the Simplex schemes.
   Parameter uncertainty and interactions are investigated through
   estimation of the variance-covariance matrix and confidence intervals.
   As expected the parameters were found to be correlated and the
   covariance matrix was found to be not diagonal. Furthermore, the
   linearized confidence interval theory failed for about one-fourth of the
   catchments while the maximum likelihood theory did not fail for any of
   the catchments. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Analytic Dupuit solutions for multi-aquifer flow are compared to exact
   solutions for two-dimensional flow in the vertical plane to determine
   the error in discharge that is introduced by adopting the Dupuit
   approximation. Specifically, the problem of flow in the bottom aquifer
   of a two-aquifer system is studied where flow is caused by a piecewise
   constant head in the top aquifer. The difference between the exact and
   Dupuit solutions is small if the leakage factor (a characteristic length
   of the aquifer system) is large relative to the thickness of the
   aquifer, even for anisotropic hydraulic conductivities. The accuracy of
   discharges obtained with a Dupuit solution improves when the aquifer is
   divided up in a number of layers, separated by leaky layers representing
   the vertical resistance to flow of the aquifer.
   In a second comparison, analytic Dupuit solutions are compared to
   numerical Dupuit solutions obtained with the finite difference method to
   determine reasonable cell sizes and domain sizes for finite difference
   models. Accurate discharges were obtained with the finite difference
   method when the cell size is chosen equal to or smaller than the
   smallest leakage factor and the domain size is at least six times the
   largest leakage factor. Both a two-aquifer system (with one leakage
   factor) and a three-aquifer system (with two leakage factors) were
   studied. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A comparison of deuterium excess or d-values of precipitation and
   groundwater at Cheju Island, Korea, indicates that, unlike in many
   temperate climates, precipitation during the whole year contributes to
   groundwater recharge. This in turn suggests that evapotranspiration
   effects are minimal, consistent with the fact that the island contains
   highly permeable volcanic rocks overlain by thin soils. This hypothesis
   is contrary to current water budget models that ascribe a significant
   role to evapotranspiration processes. Three coastal springs, and several
   streams and ponds throughout the island have enriched delta O-18 and
   delta D values that plot off the local meteoric water line and have
   relatively high Cl concentrations. This relationship is suggestive of
   seawater mixing for the coastal springs and evaporation for the streams
   and ponds. This database thus provides a useful means for evaluation of
   groundwater resources of the island. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The hydrology of the near-stream riparian zone in upland humid
   catchments is poorly understood. We examined the spatial and temporal
   aspects of riparian flowpaths during snowmelt in a headwater catchment
   within the Sleepers River catchment in northern Vermont. A transect of
   15 piezometers was sampled for Ca, Si, DOC, other major cations, and
   delta(18)O. Daily piezometric head values reflected variations in the
   stream hydrograph induced by melt and rainfall. The riparian zone
   exhibited strong upward discharge gradients. An impeding layer was
   identified between the till and surficial organic soil. Water solute
   concentrations increased toward the stream throughout the melt. Ca
   concentrations increased with depth and DOC concentrations decreased
   with depth. The concentrations of Ca in all piezometers were lower
   during active snowmelt than during post-melt low flow. Ca data suggest
   snowmelt infiltration to depth; however, only upslope piezometers
   exhibited snowmelt infiltration and consequent low delta(18)O values,
   while delta(18)O values varied less than 0.5 parts per thousand in the
   deep riparian piezometers throughout the study period. Ca and delta(18)O
   values in upslope piezometers during low streamflow were comparable to
   Ca and delta(18)O in riparian piezometers during high streamflow. The
   upland water Ca and delta(18)O may explain the deep riparian Ca dilution
   and consistent delta(18)O composition. The temporal pattern in Ca and
   delta(18)O indicate that upland water moves to the stream via a lateral
   displacement mechanism that is enhanced by the presence of distinct
   soil/textural layers. Snowmelt thus initiates the flux of pre-melt, low
   Ca upland water to depth in the riparian zone, but itself does not
   appear at depth in the riparian zone during spring melt. This is despite
   the coincident response of upland groundwater and stream discharge. (C)

Abstract = {{The main aim of this paper is to present a new method of areal rainfall
   estimation using satellite and ground-based data. This method involves
   optimal merging of the estimates provided by satellite information and
   estimates obtained from raingauges. In the merging procedure, each
   estimate is weighted according to its uncertainty given by its
   estimation variance. The uncertainty attributed to the raingauge
   estimates is obtained using block kriging, while for the satellite
   uncertainties, a novel regression approach is developed. A standard
   error is also attached to the new merged estimates. In order to test the
   algorithm, a case study has been undertaken using the EPSAT dense
   raingauge network in Niger. The complete EPSAT raingauge network (94
   gauges distributed over a 1x1 degrees square) has been used to obtain a
   detailed picture of the rainfall pattern which is then used as a
   reference for comparing the estimation schemes. The schemes compared
   are: (1) estimates based on satellite data only; (2) kriged estimates
   from a randomly selected subset of four gauges; (3) kriging with
   external drift using both satellite data and the subset of gauges; and
   (4) the new merging algorithm. The merging process gives more reliable
   results both for the mean areal rainfall and its spatial distribution.

Abstract = {{Flow structure around a recirculation well in a uniform anisotropic
   aquifer is investigated using potential theory and Stokes' stream
   function techniques. A vertical recirculation well consists of two
   screened sections (chambers) separated by an impermeable casing: one
   section extracts water from the aquifer and the other section injects
   the water back into the aquifer. Analytical formulae are derived for the
   drawdown and the stream function for a model in which the extraction and
   injection chambers of the well are modeled as uniformly distributed
   cylindrical sinks and sources, respectively. Travel times are analyzed
   for water particles traveling from the injection chamber to the
   extraction chamber along streamlines containing various percentages of
   the flow. We consider a disturbed zone (skin) having properties which
   are different from those in the uniform anisotropic aquifer owing to
   disturbance of the area near the well during installation. The effects
   of this skin on the streamlines and travel times are analyzed for
   various lengths separating the chambers and for various skin
   conductivities. The method completely eliminates the use of numerical
   finite-difference or finite-element methods and can be used for
   optimization of technological parameters in a remediation system. (C)

Abstract = {{The random walk method of resolution is applied to the study of energy
   transfer phenomena in porous media. The study is based on the similarity
   between the solute transport equation and the heat transfer equation.
   All the assumptions used in the development of the method are explained.
   The free convection phenomenon is disregarded and none of the physical
   properties are dependent on the temperature. The stochastic equations
   corresponding to the heat transfer equation are developed and the method
   is applied to a single well model of thermal energy storage in a
   homogeneous and isotropic porous aquifer. The flow velocity is defined
   by its analytical solution. The random walk results are compared with
   those of both the analytical solutions (constant injection) and the
   numerical finite difference solutions (injection-production cycle and in
   a configuration with a regional velocity). They are similar in both
   cases. The random walk method is efficient in terms of the required
   computation time. It is an effective method for configurations where the
   time or space steps restrict the use of classical methods of resolution.

Abstract = {{This study examines the application of the random walk method of
   resolution in the modelling of thermal energy storage in fractured
   aquifers. The media under consideration have a high degree of fracturing
   but a low porosity (the aperture of the fracture is small in relation to
   its overall extent).
   The customary method of resolution developed to investigate the
   transport phenomenon in such fractured media is first presented briefly.
   Next, the stochastic equations of the energy displacement in fractured
   aquifers are developed depending on the statistical location of the
   energy particles in the media. A stochastic approach is used to
   determine the flow velocity field.
   The method is applied to different configurations of fracture networks
   for a single-well system of aquifer thermal energy storage. The
   temperature fields corresponding to a fractured aquifer and its
   equivalent porous configuration are compared. An equivalent porous
   medium is not an adequate substitute for a fractured aquifer in such
   modelling. The effect of the porosity on the energy storage is obvious:
   the temperature of the extracted water and the energy recovery factor
   increase with the fracture porosity. Except in a highly anisotropic
   medium, the orientation distribution of the fractures has little effect
   on the heat transfer in an aquifer without regional how. In the presence
   of a natural hydraulic gradient, the energy recovery factor tends
   towards zero and the production temperature towards the original ambient
   temperature of the aquifer. In this case, a charge-and-discharge well
   pair proves to be a suitable alternative to the single-well system. (C)

Abstract = {{Estimating the major hydrological processes and their characteristic
   time scale is important when studying the hydrology of a catchment.
   However, in general, only limited data are available, namely climatic
   data and stream discharge. In this paper, the catchment is viewed as a
   system that converts the rainfall to the stream discharge through a
   transfer function (TF). The observed TF calculated hom the rainfall and
   the specific stream discharge depends on the hydrological processes
   operating in the catchment, By comparing the observed TF to simulated
   TF, these processes and their time scale are identified. The simulated
   TF are developed from the Dupuit and linear representations of the
   aquifer. The identification of the TF is based on the stochastic method
   using a spectral representation of the rainfall and stream-discharge
   time series. The novelty of this work is to extend the stochastic
   approach to the one-order catchment hydrology and to develop a model,
   which takes into consideration both the aquifer discharge and the rapid
   flows. The method was applied to three first-order agricultural
   catchments. For each site, the theoretical results are in accordance
   with reality. These results show that the stream discharge is dominated
   by the aquifer flow, the fast transfer accounting for 3-8\% of the total
   discharge depending on the catchment. The stochastic approach based on
   spectral analysis of the temporal variation of global observations
   appears useful to extract significant information about dominant
   processes occurring in the catchment and their characteristic time
   scale. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The assessment of groundwater conditions within an unconfined aquifer
   with a periodic boundary condition is of interest in many hydrological
   and environmental problems. A two-dimensional numerical model for
   density dependent variably saturated groundwater flow, SUTRA (Voss,
   C.I., 1984. SUTRA: a finite element simulation model for
   saturated-unsaturated, fluid-density dependent ground-water flow with
   energy transport or chemically reactive single species solute transport.
   US Geological Survey, National Center, Reston, VA) is modified in order
   to be able to simulate the groundwater flow in unconfined aquifers
   affected by a periodic boundary condition. The basic flow equation is
   changed from pressure-form to mixed-form. The model is also adjusted to
   handle a seepage-face boundary condition. Experiments are conducted to
   provide data for the groundwater response to the periodic boundary
   condition for aquifers with both vertical and sloping faces. The
   performance of the numerical model is assessed using those data. The
   results of pressure- and mixed-form approximations are compared and the
   improvement achieved through the mixed-form of the equation is
   demonstrated. The ability of the numerical model to simulate the water
   table and seepage-face is tested by modelling some published
   experimental data. Finally the numerical model is successfully verified
   against present experimental results to confirm its ability to simulate
   complex boundary conditions like the periodic head and the seepage-face
   boundary condition on the sloping face. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{When rating-curves of the form Q = gamma(h + alpha)(beta) are fitted by
   least-squares, goodness of fit as measured by the coefficient of
   determination r(2) is Often close to 1, suggesting that estimated
   discharges have high precision. This can be illusory if (a) no account
   is taken of the uncertainty in estimate of the parameter alpha, and/or
   (b) the stage h at which discharge is to be estimated is such that
   log(e)(h + alpha) lies far from the mean value of this variable
   calculated using the data points (h,Q) that define the rating-curve.
   Furthermore, since the annual maximum discharges in any M year period of
   record are all estimated from the fitted rating-curve, they will be
   correlated, even if the annual maximum stages in the M years are
   statistically independent. The usual maximum likelihood procedures for
   fitting extreme-value distributions do not take account of this
   correlation. Expressions are given for the conditional (on the values of
   the M annual maximum stages) and unconditional variances of the mean
   annual flood (Q) over bar which take account of rating-curve
   uncertainties. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{221}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of using a bi-spectral frequency analysis method to
   estimate daily mean areal precipitation (MAP) from 3-hourly METEOSAT
   visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) images over the Blue Nile river
   catchment (about 35-40 degrees East Longitude and 8-12 degrees North
   Latitude) in support of hydrologic studies is explored. The data record
   used spans the period 14 July 14 August 1995. At first, the study
   addresses the spatiotemporal variability of the satellite images, the
   determination of the relationship between topography and satellite data
   and the inference of MAP from satellite images using the bi-spectral
   method and a multivariate regression. Validation of the estimated MAPs
   is carried out with data from a sparse raingauge network in the region.
   These estimates are next used in a sensitivity study to determine the
   dependence of the Blue Nile region hydrologic response on the type of
   precipitation forcing (raingauge-based vs, satellite-based estimates). A
   conceptual semi-distributed hydrologic model is used to simulate
   hydrologic processes pertaining to soil water and channel routing with a
   1 X 1 degrees resolution. Principal conclusions of this initial
   sensitivity study are: (a) use of the bi-spectral method, complemented
   with an appropriate multivariate regression formulation, improves MAP
   estimates during the aforementioned time interval substantially, for
   daily rainfall rates greater than about 7 mm day(-1); (b) aggregate
   hydrologic response of the Blue Nile region is very sensitive to the
   type of precipitation forcing used; and (c) substantial spatial
   variability of the sensitivity of hydrologic response to the type of
   precipitation forcing exists in the region. The use of satellite-derived
   MAP estimates is recommended together with recalibration of hydrologic
   models using spatially variable parameter values, and analysis of
   uncertainty propagation through model components and for Various
   sub-catchments. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater pollution from non-point sources, such as nitrate from
   agricultural activities, is a problem of increasing concern.
   Comprehensive modelling tools of the physically based type are well
   proven for small-scale applications with good data availability, such as
   plots or small experimental catchments. The two key problems related to
   large-scale simulation are data availability at the large scale and
   model upscaling/aggregation to represent conditions at larger scale.
   This paper presents a methodology and two case studies for large-scale
   simulation of aquifer contamination due to nitrate leaching. Readily
   available data from standard European level databases such as GISCO,
   EUROSTAT and the European Environment Agency (EEA) have been used as the
   basis of modelling. These data were supplemented by selected readily
   available data from national sources. The model parameters were all
   assessed from these data by use of various transfer functions, and no
   model calibration was carried out. The adopted upscaling procedure
   combines upscaling from point to field scale using effective parameters
   with a statistically based aggregation procedure from field to catchment
   scale, preserving the areal distribution of soil types, vegetation types
   and agricultural practices on a catchment basis. The methodology was
   tested on two Danish catchments with good simulation results on water
   balance and nitrate concentration distributions in groundwater. The
   upscaling/aggregation procedure appears to be applicable in many areas
   with regard to root zone processes such as runoff generation and nitrate
   leaching, while it has important limitations with regard to hydrograph
   shape due to its lack of accounting for scale effects in relation to
   stream aquifer interaction. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Understanding of the hydrology of upland blanket peatlands has been
   limited both by the logistical difficulties of obtaining data from such
   environments and by technical difficulties with plot scale
   investigations of peat hydrology. The relative importance of
   infiltration-excess and percolation-excess as runoff generating
   mechanisms as opposed to the saturation-excess mechanism remains
   unclear. This study uses catchment-scale runoff data, in combination
   with monitoring of water table levels, to identify the relative
   importance of these mechanisms for an upland peat catchment within the
   Moor House National Nature Reserve in the UK. Mean runoff coefficients
   for the catchment are 0.4 and the hood hydrographs are flashy. Monitored
   water table in the catchment is within 5 cm of the surface (i.e. within
   the acrotelm) 93\% of the time. High stream flows always occur at times
   of high water table suggesting that overland and near surface runoff is
   controlled by saturation of the catotelm rather than by infiltration
   capacity. Depressed rates of water table recovery at the end of a
   prolonged period of low water table in 1995 suggest possible physical
   changes once the peat has dried out. The likelihood that such periods of
   low water table will become more common under global warming scenarios
   raises concern over the impact of such changes: increased erosion, water
   discoloration and increased CO2 flux may result. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The stemflow of 30 sample trees belonging to six different species was
   quantified in the laurel forest of Agua Garcia, Tenerife, Canary
   Islands, during a complete year. Different methods described in the
   literature, for scaling up the stemflow values from tree level to stand
   level were applied. The best for this type of forest is based on the
   application of annual regressions between basal area and stemflow in
   each species, giving a total annual stand stemflow of 42.861 m(-2). This
   represents 6.85\% of annual gross precipitation. This is not a very high
   value but important to be taken into account in the determination of the
   water balance of the forest. An antecedent precipitation of 2 mm was
   necessary for the initiation of the stand stemflow. Stemflow attained
   10\% of gross precipitation during big rain events, being positively
   correlated with the mean hourly rain intensity.
   Differences among trees and species were also studied resulting that
   trees with the biggest crown area, not dominated by their neighbours,
   and with the smoothest bark collected the largest volumes of stemflow in
   the stand. Bark roughness, divergence angle of the branches with respect
   to the trunk and also the size of the leaves, were responsible for the
   differences between species.
   As a consequence of the stemflow the rain can be concentrated up to 12.8
   times in the infiltration areas of the trees which could produce better
   soil conditions for tree growth. The results obtained in the Agua Garcia
   laurel forest stand are the first stemflow data obtained for the
   Canarian laurel forest and they are in the range found in other types of
   forests. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. ALI rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a mechanistic model of soil deformation and water
   infiltration into a Vertisol of Guadeloupe (French West Indies), which
   accounts for the three components of porosity of this soil (matric,
   structural and macro-cracks). Time and space scales are respectively of
   several hours and the prism delimited by macro-cracks. The model
   accounts for water movements from the structural porosity and from the
   macro-cracks into the matric porosity. It simulates the
   non-equidimensional deformations of the prism resulting from water
   storage in the matric porosity. Inputs of the model, measured in the
   laboratory, are the shrinkage curve, the retention curve and the
   hydraulic conductivity of the matric porosity. The anisotropy ratio of
   the soil deformation was measured in situ. Experiments were conducted in
   situ to provide structural parameters and data to fit and test the
   model. It is possible to find a unique set of parameters for each
   experiment. However, parameters significantly differ from one experiment
   to another. The model shows that the structural water flow regulates the
   partition of water infiltrating within the prism and of water flowing in
   the macro-cracks. The model does not accurately predict water
   infiltration because of a poor modelling of water flow in the structural
   porosity. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The design of a pump-and-treat groundwater remediation system can be
   solved as an optimization problem. A common approach in this formulation
   is to minimize the total cost of the pump-and-treat system, while
   defining the locations and extraction or injection rates of the
   candidate pumping wells as continuous decision variables. With this
   choice, the degree of freedom added to the optimization problem yields
   significant improvements on the solution. In this approach coupled
   solution of groundwater simulation models and optimization algorithms
   are required. The repeated use of the groundwater simulation models
   throughout the optimization cycle tends to be numerically complex and
   computationally costly when the governing equations are nonlinear. To
   overcome this drawback, we propose a new computational procedure,
   identified as progressive genetic algorithm (PGA), to solve the optimal
   design problem. PGA is a subdomain method, which combines standard
   genetic algorithm with ground water simulation models in an iterative
   solution process and provides a powerful tool for the solution of highly
   nonlinear optimization problems. Numerical examples are included to
   demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
   Applications indicate that the proposed approach provides a feasible
   alternative for the solution of nonlinear optimization problems in
   groundwater management. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Saltwater upconing that occurs in an aquifer overlain by a leaky
   confining unit is described by an analytical model that assumes the
   existence of a sharp interface between the freshwater and saltwater and
   the occurrence of a critical rise in the interface, above which only an
   unstable cone can exist. At the critical rise, the pressure on the
   freshwater side of the interface is equal to the pressure on the
   saltwater side of the interface. Also, the curve for pressure versus
   depth on the freshwater side of the interface is tangent to the curve
   for pressure versus depth on the saltwater side of the interface at the
   critical condition, and thus the slopes of the freshwater and saltwater
   pressure distribution curves are equal. These two conditions, equality
   of pressures and equality of pressure gradients, are used to derive two
   equations that can be solved simultaneously for the critical interface
   rise and the associated critical pumping rate. Instead of assuming a
   fixed value for the critical rise of the interface, its location is
   calculated using an analytical equation expressed in terms of aquifer
   and confining unit properties and well geometry. The associated critical
   pumping rate is calculated as a function of aquifer and confining unit
   properties, well geometry, and the critical interface rise ratio. For
   field conditions, the critical rise of the interface and critical
   pumping rate can be calculated analytically or graphically. In an
   example calculation, the critical interface rise ratio, which is the
   ratio of the critical interface rise divided by the distance from the
   original location of the interface to the bottom of the pumped well, is
   calculated to be 0.710 and the critical pumping rate is calculated to be
   3.72 x 10(4) m(3)/day. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   the combined and separate effects of capillarity and
   concentration-engendered viscosity on the groundwater dynamics of a
   two-dimensional system simulating a dry lake. We found that accounting
   for concentration-engendered viscosity effects under saturated water
   flow conditions gives totally different groundwater dynamics from the
   case where these effects are neglected. However, concentration-dependent
   viscosity effects were minor when unsaturated water flow conditions were
   present. Under variably-saturated flow conditions, capillarity effects
   gave totally different hydraulics in the porous domain from the
   saturated flow case; upwelling regions observed under saturated flow
   conditions were downwelling when capillarity effects were present. A
   mesh orientation study revealed that density-dependent flows were
   susceptible to the orientation of the diagonals of the triangular
   elements. A discussion on the accuracy and the efficiency of the MARUN
   model in the context of density- and viscosity-dependent flows in
   two-dimensional variably-saturated media is also provided. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The consequences of a decline in soil nitrogen following ploughing of
   permanent pasture and land-use change are explored in terms of nitrate
   export at the catchment scale. The release of reserves of organic
   nitrogen built up in grassland soils is modelled as a first-order
   kinetic decay. The build up of reserves of nitrogen upon reversion to
   pasture is modelled both as a first-order process and under the
   assumption that new grassland can absorb all the nitrogen applied to it.
   Results show that the release and sequestration of nitrogen in these
   reservoirs shows supply-limited hysteresis, and consequently the
   ploughing-up of permanent pasture has the dominant effect. Allowing for
   the present land-use and the effect of rainfall, the model is compared
   to streamwater nitrate concentrations measured in the Slapton Wood
   catchment, south west England. Significant overestimates are observed
   that suggest that nitrogen released from ploughing up of grassland is
   either in an organic form or that significant denitrification capacity
   is available. Optimising the model against the data from Slapton Wood
   catchment confirms there is an elastic capacity for denitirification
   within the catchment. At the catchment scale the grassland reservoirs
   acts as a constant source of nitrogen whilst the effect of the reversion
   of land to permanent pasture, at the catchment scale, attains rapid
   equilibrium and does not continue to remove significant levels of
   nitrogen after the first year. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   with a relative error less than 0.1\%, and one with a relative error of
   less than 0.015\%. These approximations are likely suitable for all

Abstract = {{A new method is presented for predicting sediment sorting associated
   with soil erosion by raindrop impact for non-equilibrium conditions. The
   form of soil erosion considered is that which results from raindrop
   impact in the presence of shallow overland flow itself where the flow is
   not capable of eroding sediment. The method specifically considers early
   time runoff and erosion when sediment leaving an eroding area is
   generally finer and thus may have a higher potential for transport of
   sorbed pollutants. The new mechanism described is the formation of a
   deposited layer on the soil surface, which is shown to lead to sediment
   sorting during an erosion event. The deposited layer is taken to have
   two roles in this process: to temporarily store sediment on the surface
   between successive trajectories, and to shield the underlying soil from
   erosive stresses. Equations describing the dynamics of the suspended
   sediment mixture and the deposited layer are developed. By integrating
   these equations over the length of eroding land element and over the
   duration of the erosion event, an event-based solution is proposed which
   predicts total sediment sorting over the event. This solution is shown
   to be consistent with experimentally observed trends in enrichment of
   fine sediment. Predictions using this approach are found to only partly
   explain measured enrichment for sets of experimental data for two quite
   different soils, but to be in poor agreement for an aridsol of
   dispersive character. It is concluded that the formation of the
   deposited layer is a significant mechanism in the enrichment of fine
   sediment and associated sorbed pollutants, but that processes in the
   dispersive soil are not as well described by the theory presented. (C)

Abstract = {{To determine the fate and movement of sewage derived contaminants and
   their possible interaction with surface waters in the Florida (USA)
   Keys, two types of experiments were conducted using SF6 as an artificial
   tracer. The first type of experiment examined fluid flow from septic
   tanks placed in Miami Oolite on Big Pine Key, where there is a shallow
   freshwater lens overlying saline groundwaters. Here groundwater
   transport rates were constrained to be between 0.11 and 1.87 m/h,
   travelling in an easterly direction. The second type of experiment took
   place on Key Large where there is no freshwater aquifer and the matrix
   of the aquifer is solely the more porous Key Large limestone. Here we
   injected the tracer into a shallow well which was screened from 0.6 to
   10 m. This allowed us to evaluate groundwater movement in the shallow
   upper portion of the aquifer, the area to which inputs by septic tanks
   occur. Groundwater transport rates in the Upper Keys were as great as
   3.7 m/h and were controlled by the Atlantic tide. SF6 laden groundwater
   plumes moved back and forth due to tidal pumping and reached nearby
   surface waters within 8 h. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A mathematical model is presented to describe the variations of the
   water table in an unconfined aquifer due to time-varying recharge
   applied from four rectangular basins. The model is developed by solving
   the linearised Boussinesq equation using the extended finite Fourier
   cosine transform. The time-varying recharge rate is approximated by a
   number of piecewise linear elements of different lengths and slopes
   depending on the nature of the variation in recharge rate. Application
   of this model for the prediction of water table fluctuations and in the
   sensitivity analysis of various controlling parameters on the aquifer
   response is demonstrated in an example. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Catchment runoff is the most widely used catchment scale measurement in
   modelling studies, and we have a reasonable degree of confidence in its
   accuracy. The advent of satellites gives access to a new suite of
   measurements taken over a defined spatial range. These measurements,
   principally reflected or emitted radiation, provide hydrologists with
   new possibilities for quantifying the state of a catchment. Surface
   temperatures can be readily measured by a satellite on a scale
   comparable to the size of a small catchment.
   In this paper we show that satellite sensed temperatures can provide an
   important measure of catchment status, which can complement runoff
   measurements in water balance studies. A one-dimensional model, which
   couples the land surface energy balance with the soil and surface water
   balance is tested by comparison with runoff and with remotely sensed
   surface temperature measurements. Simulations have been run over four
   years for two small catchments which have a fairly homogeneous
   vegetation, one being forest and its neighbour pasture. Satellite
   ``surface{''} temperatures have been interpreted in terms of the energy
   balance, and used as a test of modelling accuracy. An ``effective{''}
   surface temperature is calculated as a weighted mean of temperatures of
   the separate soil and leaf surfaces. This modelled ``effective{''}
   temperature correlates well with Landsat TM surface temperatures.
   When pasture replaces forest, the model predicts a reduction in
   evapotranspiration of around 30\%, a three-fold increase in runoff, and
   an increase in mean soil moisture status. The change to pasture also
   results in a rise in mean effective surface temperature of about 4
   degrees C, and an increase in summer diurnal temperature range from 10
   to 22 degrees C. The winter diurnal temperature range is similar for
   both vegetation systems.
   Inclusion of soil moisture variability in thermal properties results in
   an increase in mean daily maximum temperature of about 2 degrees C in
   summer and winter, without much change in daily minima. The daily mean
   temperature is not significantly affected. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Noble gas isotopes (He-3, He-4, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe), tritium (H-3),
   chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and dissolved oxygen (O-2) were seasonally
   measured in a small groundwater system recharged by infiltration of
   river water at Linsental, northeastern Switzerland. All Groundwater
   samples contained an excess of atmospheric noble gases ('excess air')
   usually with an elemental composition equal to air. The concentrations
   of atmospheric noble gases in the groundwater were used to calculate the
   excess air component and the water temperature at recharge. The noble
   gas temperatures (NGTs) in the boreholes close to the river vary
   seasonally, however, the average NGT of all samples lies close to the
   mean annual temperature of the river water. Groundwater ages were
   calculated using the tritium/helium-3 (H-3/He-3) dating method. The
   water ages of the samples obtained near the river depend on the amount
   of recently infiltrated river water and are young during times of active
   river discharge. In contrast, the mean water age of about 3 years of the
   deep aquifer remained nearly constant over the sampling period. The
   observed CFC-11 (CFCl3) and CFC-12 (CF2Cl2) concentrations are
   significantly higher than the atmospheric equilibrium concentrations and
   therefore CFCs do not provide any direct information on the residence
   time of the groundwater. Nevertheless, the CFC excess in the groundwater
   shows a linear increase with the H-3/He-3 age. Additionally, both
   accumulation of radiogenic He (He-4(rad)) and O-2 consumption are
   strongly correlated with residence time. Al these correlations can be
   interpreted either in terms of mixing of recently infiltrated river
   water with older groundwater or in terms of accumulation/consumption
   rates. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In an empirical/statistical approach to the interaction between
   watershed characteristics and lake water quality, the inter-lake
   variance of 87 chemically monitored dimictic glacial/boreal lakes is
   correlated to the distributed properties of catchment descriptors. In a
   total, 33 classes of land cover, soils and bedrock are identified and
   described with respect to element morphology and hydrology. Together
   with descriptors of catchment/lake morphology, hydrology and climate,
   they serve as explanatory variables in the construction of statistical
   regression models that assess the chemical lake water constituents:
   conductivity, hardness, Secchi depth, color, alkalinity, total
   phosphorus and pH. As a result, the four former variables (cond, H,
   Secc, col) are simulated with precision enough for quantitatively
   predictive purposes, whereas the three latter (alk, TP, pH) provide a
   rather qualitative - although highly significant - estimate. Using
   normalized regression coefficients, catchment descriptors are ranked
   with respect to their general importance. It is found that only fifteen
   landscape elements - out of the 33 totally identified - and seven other
   catchment/lake descriptors occur as significantly correlated to the
   inter-lake variance of water quality. The ranking of element descriptors
   provide a basis for decisions regarding the location of projects that
   affect the properties of landscape elements (e.g. damming, irrigation,
   mining). When applied in watershed management, projects that intend to
   conserve lake water quality should be located within as low ranked
   elements as possible, whereas the location of projects that strive to
   manipulate lake water quality may be calculated as a function of the
   chemical alteration desired. With the analyzed database being large
   enough to encompass a wide population of typical lakes, the results
   should be applicable in many dimictic glacial/boreal lakes throughout
   the world. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The catchment of the river Adour (SW France) has been examined in order
   to analyse spatio-temporal variations in a number of key variables
   (flow, suspended matter, nitrate and dissolved orthophosphate
   concentrations) over a 25-year period (1972-1996).
   Within the catchment area, it has been possible to discern how
   hydroclimatic fluctuations have affected the watershed, with dry periods
   in 1972-1976 and 1983-1993 alternating with wetter phases in 1977-1982
   and 1994-1995. The anthropogenic activity, primarily, involving the use
   of water for agricultural purposes, has also had a major impact during
   this period, particularly in the downstream areas of the catchment.
   Suspended matter fluxes display regular downstream increases with
   significant erosion being evident in the mountainous region contrasting
   with retention in the floodplains area downstream. These fluxes exhibit
   temporal and spatial variations with peaks occurring every 3-5 years,
   1975-1977, 1979, 1982, 1985, 1987 and 1992. Some of these peaks are
   suggested to be related to anthropogenic activity involving river
   management, including the cutting of meanders and the construction of
   dykes for flood prevention.
   Nitrate concentrations evince a similar pattern to the suspended matter
   fluxes with enhanced levels of downstream. The confluence of the Adour
   with the Midouze appears not to have any major impact on the nitrate
   concentration. In the downstream areas, an uptake of nitrate is
   registered indicating the activity of the riparian vegetation. For the
   entire catchment, maximal nitrate concentrations are observed in 1979,
   1982, 1987, 1991-1992 and 1995. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The temporal structure of rainfall was investigated by means of
   multifractal analysis of 15-min and daily rainfall, measured with
   recording and non-recording gauges, over periods of up to 30 years. The
   data were collected at Vale Formoso, Portugal. Spectral analysis and
   study of the moments of the rainfall intensity on a range of scales
   showed that multifractal scaling is present. Empirical exponent
   functions describing the scaling of the moments of the rainfall
   intensity were determined for different ranges of time scales. Special
   attention was given to the discontinuities in the scaling function
   caused by the divergence of moments and the limited resolution of the
   measuring devices and data. The description of the empirical scaling
   functions by a multifractal model based on Levy variables was also
   investigated. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A Multiple-input single-output time-invariant, non-linear model, based
   on a black-box systems approach, was used for how forecasting during
   monsoon flood events using daily data. The model consists of a
   non-linear component representing the immediate and moderately delayed
   responses and a linear component representing the delayed response of
   the catchment. It is based on a structure originally proposed by
   Muftuoglu, R.F. (New models for nonlinear catchment analysis. J. Hydrol.
   73 (1984) 335-357; Monthly runoff generation by non-linear models. J.
   Hydrol. 125 (1991) 277-291). The spatial variation in rainfall amounts
   is incorporated in the model by treating the rainfall as separate lumped
   inputs. The model, in its non-parametric form, is first calibrated on
   various data sets stacked together and then verification tests are
   performed on different data sets. The results show that the model is
   capable of forecasting flows with high efficiencies for the data used,
   indicating that it provides a low cost alternative model for use in
   sparse-data scenarios and for small-one-off projects. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Stump Bay wetland forms part of the South Taupo wetland, which is
   situated on the southern shore of Lake Taupo and belongs to the largest
   continuous wetlands in the North Island of New Zealand. The wetland's
   extent has increased since the beginning of Lake Taupo's artificial lake
   level regulation in 1941. Hydrological and hydrochemical data collected
   seasonally from nine piezometers installed in the Stump Bay wetland over
   a duration of two years show the influence of the stratigraphy and
   groundwater flow on the hydrochemistry of the wetland.
   The hydrology is characterised by through-flowing or discharging
   groundwater, with a main flow direction towards the lake. The
   piezometric contour map shows a groundwater divide running from
   south-west to north-east, creating an eastern and western discharge
   system. Higher dissolved oxygen concentrations (0.3-6.1 g/m(3)) and
   slightly higher temperatures (8-18.9 degrees C) in the western part of
   Stump Bay suggest the presence of Tongariro River seepage water in this
   area. The eastern part of the wetland is likely to be fed by discharging
   water originating from the Turangi plain.
   The main chemical characteristic of Stump Bay's groundwater is the high
   concentration of total dissolved iron (up to 145 g/m(3)). High iron
   concentrations are found to be associated with the presence of a clay
   layer within the top metre of peat/sediment. The reduction of iron
   controls the groundwater's conductivity (0.07-0.6 mS/cm), alkalinity
   (18-423 g/m(3)), and pH (6-7.2). The nutrient status of the wetland's
   groundwater is generally low. Increased microbial activity at higher
   temperatures during summer is likely to cause seasonal fluctuations in
   pH, alkalinity, concentrations of calcium, magnesium, and for some sites
   dissolved iron. All of these parameters have higher values in summer and
   lower values in winter. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Most hydrologic/water quality (H/WQ) models that use rainfall as input
   assume spatial homogeneity of rainfall. Under this assumption this study
   assesses the variability induced in calibrated model parameters solely
   due to rainfall spatial variability. The AGNPS model and a network of 17
   raingauges were used. Model parameters were estimated using rainfall
   observed at each gauge location, one at a time, as though that rainfall
   covered the entire catchment. A large uncertainty in the estimated
   parameters resulted from the spatial variability of rainfall. The
   uncertainty in the estimated parameters using the rainfall observed by a
   single gauge exceeded the rainfall measurement error. A large
   uncertainty in estimated model parameters can be expected if detailed
   variations in the input rainfall are not taken into account. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The effects of seasonality on nutrient patterns and export in streamflow
   were determined for a 7.3 km(2) agricultural hill-land watershed in
   Pennsylvania for a 12-year period, 1984-96. Dissolved phosphorus (DP)
   concentrations were highest in stormflow for all seasons (0.030 mg
   l(-1)), especially summer (0.039 mg l(-1)) when the flow was the least.
   About two-thirds of the DP export was in stormflow, with two-thirds of
   this export occurring during winter and spring when five of the seven
   largest stormflow events within a year occur. For larger stormflows, DP
   concentrations were positively correlated with the flow rate, which
   contributed to storm dominance of DP export. Export of NO3-N, and to a
   lesser extent DP, by flow component and season were controlled by flow
   rate rather than concentration. Summer was least important, contributing
   only 7-8\% of the annual export of water, DP, and NO3-N. The NO3-N
   concentrations were the lowest for the baseflow (5.36 mg l(-1)) and the
   highest for the elevated baseflow (7.12 mg l(-1)) across seasons. Mon of
   the NO3-N export was in non-stormflow than stormflow and occurred mostly
   in winter and spring. One 50-year return period storm event generated a
   substantial portion (9\%) of the DP exported for the 12-year period of
   the record, but had much less impact on water (2\%) and NO3-N (1\%)
   export. P management and control decisions for watersheds need to be
   developed in a storm-based, source-area framework, whereas N management
   and control decisions depend more on managing and balancing N use over
   the watershed. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A fuzzy rule-based model is developed for simulation of solute transport
   processes in the vadose zone. Underlying physical processes of solute
   transport described by appropriate differential equations are captured
   in fuzzy rules. These rules are derived from a training set obtained
   from different test runs of the SWMS\_2D model which simulates water
   flow and solute transport in two-dimensional variably saturated media.
   Fuzzy rules operate between two adjacent cells at each time step. Solute
   concentration of the upper cell, and solute concentration difference
   between two adjacent cells are used as premises. For a given time step,
   the solute flux between the two cells is taken as the response, which is
   combined with the conservation of mass to update the new solute
   concentration for the new time step. The methodology is applied to solve
   the breakthrough curve of bromide movement in a soil column. It is also
   generalized to the same problem under different soil and boundary
   conditions. In both cases, the fuzzy solution appears to be similar to
   the measured bromide concentration as well as the SWMS\_2D model
   results. The methodology provides a more efficient alternative to
   existing modeling methods. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that a variety of remote sensing techniques
   may be used for the estimation of soil moisture over large areas. The
   shallow moisture sensing depth of passive microwave measurements,
   however, limits the use of remotely sensed soil moisture for many
   land-atmosphere interaction studies. In this study, a method is proposed
   for soil moisture profile estimation by sequential assimilation of
   surface layer soil moisture using a four-layer land surface model. A key
   difference between this and earlier approaches is that it evaluates the
   relative merits of daily assimilation of microwave measurements of
   surface soil wetness and measurements of rainfall for the estimation of
   soil moisture profile. We compare and contrast the profile estimation
   from assimilation of soil moisture and rainfall measurements using
   observed data sets from the Kansas prairie in the United States.
   Influence of measurement error, frequency of assimilation, and
   availability of precipitation measurements on the estimation of soil
   moisture profile is also explored. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Many important microbial, chemical and physical processes in soils take
   place within water-filled pores. Whilst the behaviour of chemicals and
   micro-organisms in aqueous conditions has often been thoroughly
   researched, their behaviour in soils is still difficult to predict. One
   approach to this is to superimpose models of the behaviour of chemicals
   and micro-organisms in water onto a model of the behaviour of water in
   soil. In this paper we set out to demonstrate the potential to use a
   simple cellular automaton rule set to describe the location of water in
   a soil matrix under varying conditions of matric suction for possible
   future combining with other process models.
   The model used a three-dimensional array of pixels (which could be solid
   or void) to represent the structure of a small volume of soil.
   Parameters describing the porosity and the proportion of void pixels
   directly adjacent to solid pixels were used to define the structure.
   These were derived from image analysis of resin impregnated samples of a
   silty clay, silt loam and sandy loam. Ballotini beads were also used as
   a further ``soil type{''}. Water retention under a range of increasing
   suctions (1-300 kPa) was modelled and compared with measurements made
   using conventional methods on the same soils.
   The cellular automaton rule set generally produced a good description of
   water release from soils. Errors were largely attributable to limits on
   the maximum and minimum particle sizes which could be represented in the
   present model due to limitations of computing power. This approach to
   modelling soil water offers many opportunities for understanding complex
   interactions between soil water and other processes occurring in soils.

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that the noise limits the performance of many
   techniques used for identification and prediction of deterministic
   systems. The extent of the influence of noise on the analysis of
   hydrological (or any real) data is difficult to understand due to the
   lack of knowledge on the level and nature of the noise. Meanwhile, a
   variety of nonlinear noise reduction methods have been developed and
   applied to hydrological (and other real) data. The present study
   addresses some of the potential problems in applying such methods to
   chaotic hydrological (or any real) data, and discusses the usefulness of
   estimating the noise level prior to noise reduction. The study proposes
   a systematic approach to additive measurement noise reduction in chaotic
   hydrological (or any real) data, by coupling a noise level determination
   method and a noise reduction method. The approach is first demonstrated
   on noise-added artificial chaotic data (Henon data) and then applied on
   real chaotic hydrological data, the Singapore rainfall data. The
   approach uses the prediction accuracy as the main diagnostic tool to
   determine the most probable noise level, and the correlation dimension
   as a supplementary tool. The results indicate a noise level between 9
   and 11\% in the Singapore rainfall data, providing a possible
   explanation for the low prediction accuracy achieved in earlier studies
   for the (noisy) original rainfall data. Significant improvement in the
   prediction accuracy achieved for the noise-reduced rainfall data
   provides additional support for the above. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This study examined whether the quasi-distributed response function used
   in TOPMODEL provides superior performance for event simulation in small,
   temperate forested catchments, compared to lumped reservoir
   representations of runoff routing similar to those employed in many
   catchment hydrology models. The alternatives were a two-reservoir
   black-box model and a three-reservoir model structured to represent our
   perceptual model of runoff processes based on held observations. A
   second objective was to test the statistical significance of differences
   in model performance using a new approach that combines the Jackknife
   with analysis of variance (ANOVA). The models were tested against
   streamflow data from two small forested catchments using Klemes'
   hierarchical scheme for operational validation. At levels 1
   (split-sample test) and 2 (proxy-basin test) there were no statistically
   significant differences in model performance when expressed using the
   entire hydrographs. However, TOPMODEL did appear to provide superior
   fits to the peak flows. At level 3 (differential split-sample test),
   TOPMODEL performed statistically significantly better than both lumped
   models in both catchments. The statistical analysis for level 4
   (proxy-basin differential split-sample test) indicates that TOPMODEL
   performed significantly better than the lumped models at one catchment
   but not at the other, The statistical design combining ANOVA with the
   Jackknife shows promise as a workable method for establishing
   statistical significance of differences in model performance indices
   based on the entire hydrograph, However. performance indices bused only
   on the peak flows exhibited extreme skew that was not amenable to
   normalization by transformation. Further research should investigate
   alternative, robust methods for assessing statistical significance of
   model performance indices. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights

Abstract = {{Continuous volumetric discharge data was collected at six acoustic
   velocity meters (AVMs) installed in two canals along the eastern
   boundary of Everglades National Park (ENP) in Florida, USA. Discharge
   data from these six sites, and from two others monitored by state and
   federal government agencies, were used to compute the rate of water
   exchange (Q(g)) between six canal reaches and their surroundings (the
   unconfined Biscayne Aquifer and its overlying wetlands). Net water
   exchange (Q(g)) for the two northernmost canal reaches corresponded to
   groundwater, but further south in the study area Q(g) included a surface
   water component. While canal L-31W was built to supply water to ENP,
   data show that its primary (though unintended) function during the study
   period was redistribution of water from north to south within ENP. This
   ``hydrologic short-circuiting{''} (where water flowed south in L-31W
   rather than in wetlands) is problematic for ecosystem restoration
   efforts. A similar short-circuiting operates on a larger spatial scale
   over the entire basin of the larger C-111 canal, the main flood control
   canal in the area. While this hydrologic regime does offer flood control
   benefits, changes in water management infrastructure and operations are
   needed to restore more natural spatial and temporal patterns of flow
   through wetlands in the area.
   Four of the AVM stations were located close to large water control
   structures on the canals. Agreement was generally good though slightly
   non-linear between daily average discharge (Q) values based on AVM data
   and those determined using hydraulic rating equations at nearby flow
   control structures. The AVMs used in this study required significant
   maintenance but provided sound data on discharge. They provided a good
   check on hydraulic rating equations at Row control structures,
   quantified rates of water leakage around and/or through these
   structures, allowed discharge measurements where there are no
   structures, and allowed calculation of rates of water exchange with
   canals. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the possibility of deriving frequency distributions
   of extreme discharges by continuous simulation. The rainfall-runoff
   model TOPMODEL is applied within the Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty
   Estimation (GLUE) framework to the River Wye catchment, Plynlimon,
   Wales, using a 21-year period of rainfall and discharge observations.
   Rejection of non-behavioural parameter sets is achieved through an
   evaluation of both annual maximum discharge and continuous hydrograph
   simulation. Annual maximum peak timings and rankings are also
   considered. It is demonstrated that, within the prescribed limits,
   TOPMODEL can adequately achieve both flood frequency and continuous
   simulation modelling goals. Extension of the flood frequency estimations
   beyond the upper limit of the observed series is attained through the
   coupling of behavioural TOPMODEL sets with those of a stochastic
   rainfall generator for 1000-year simulation periods using hourly time
   steps. The rainfall model is conditioned on the observed rainfall
   frequency statistics for different storm duration classes, also within
   the GLUE framework. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To test the transmissivity feedback hypothesis of runoff generation,
   surface and subsurface waters were monitored and sampled during the 1996
   snowmelt at various topographic positions in a 41 ha forested headwater
   catchment at Sleepers River, Vermont. Two conditions that promote
   transmissivity feedback existed in the catchment during the melt period.
   First, saturated hydraulic conductivity increased toward land surface,
   from a geometric mean of 3.6 mm h(-1) in glacial till to 25.6 mm h(-1)
   in deep soil to 54.0 mm h(-1) in shallow soil. Second, groundwater
   levels rose to within 0.3 m of land surface at all riparian sites and
   most hillslope sites at peak melt. The importance of transmissivity
   feedback to streamflow generation was tested at the catchment scale by
   examination of physical and chemical patterns of groundwater in
   near-stream (discharge) and hillslope (recharge/lateral flow) zones, and
   within a geomorphic hollow (convergent flow).
   The presence of transmissivity feedback was supported by the abrupt
   increase in streamflow as the water table rose into the surficial,
   transmissive zone; a flattening of the groundwater level vs, streamflow
   curve occurred at most sites. This relation had a clockwise hysteresis
   (higher groundwater level for given discharge on rising limb than at
   same discharge on falling limb) at riparian sites, suggesting that the
   riparian zone was the dominant source area during the rising limb of the
   melt hydrograph. Hysteresis was counterclockwise at hillslope sites,
   suggesting that hillslope drainage controlled the snowmelt recession.
   End member mixing analysis using Ca, Mg, Na, dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC), and Si showed that stream chemistry could be explained as a
   two-component mixture of groundwater high in base cations and an
   O-horizon/overland how water high in DOG. The dominance of shallow How
   paths during events was indicated by the high positive correlation of
   DOC with streamflow (r(2) = 0.82). Despite the occurrence of
   transmissivity feedback. hillslope till and soil water were ruled out as
   end members primarily because their distinctive high-Si composition hail
   little or no effect on streamwater composition, Till water from the
   geomorphic hollow had a chemistry very close to streamwater base flow,
   and may represent the base now end member better than the more
   concentrated riparian groundwater. During snowmelt, streamwater
   composition shifted as this base flow was diluted - not by shallow
   groundwater from the hillslope, but rather bq a more surficial
   O-horizon/overland flow water, (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A linear systems analysis applied to ground-water flow is presented as
   an alternative modeling technique to traditional discretized
   ground-water models (i.e. finite-difference and finite-element), which
   require elaborate parameters and boundary conditions. Linear systems
   analysis has been used extensively for surface-water modeling and to 3
   lesser extent for groundwater applications. We present a method for the
   analysis of an aquifer's response in hydraulic head to recharge that
   comprises two major components. The first component is to predict the
   drop in hydraulic head over time if recharge is eliminated. By fitting
   logarithmic curves to selected short-term hydraulic head recession
   periods, a long-term recession or ``base head{''} can be established.
   The estimation of base head is necessary for the second component of the
   method, which is the derivation of an impulse response function or
   transfer function. The transfer function H-as derived by deconvolution
   of two time series data sets - estimated recharge and the measured
   response in hydraulic head. An aquifer's response to recharge can be
   characterized and modeled by using the transfer function. which also
   establishes the time to peak response. the response time distribution,
   and the total memory length of the system. The method requires fitting
   smooth curves to the oscillatory transfer function derived by
   deconvolution in the Fourier transform domain. The smooth curve is
   considered to be the physically valid transfer function. In this
   analysis, curve fitting was more effective than other smoothing
   techniques commonly used. We applied the method to the karstic Madison
   aquifer and found that thr time to peak response is less than one month,
   the system's total memory is about six years, and a logarithmic curve
   best fits the system response. This method has potential to be useful as
   3 predictive tool in aquifer management. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{A generalised hybrid model to generate point rainfall for a wide range
   of aggregation levels is presented in this paper, The rainfall process
   is expressed as a product of a binary chain model. which preserves the
   dry and wet sequences as well as the mean, and a correlated jitter used
   to improve the deficiencies in the second-order properties of the binary
   chain. Analytical derivations of the moments of a binary chain are
   presented. As the jitter model the exponential of a second-order
   autoregressive Gaussian process is selected. Two possible binary chain
   models are analysed, a non-randomised Bartlett-Lewis model and a Markov
   chain. Although both binary chain models perform equally well, the
   Bartlett-Lewis model is preferred for reasons of parameter parsimony.

Abstract = {{Regression analysis is usually the statistical tool of choice in
   hydrological studies when there is a strong correlation between two
   variables. However, weak correlations can also be of interest if a
   region within the scatter plot is data-free. This could direct attention
   to seeking some underlying physical process that might create regions
   with low probability of generating data points. A necessary prior
   requirement here is to verify that the data-free area in the plot is
   sufficiently large to be a real effect and not a visual illusion. This
   check can be most simply carried out in a hypothesis-testing framework.
   A permutation approach to hypothesis testing is suggested for the
   particular case where a data-free region occupies one of the corners of
   a scatter plot, and a test statistic Delta is presented for testing the
   statistical significance of the size of this ``empty corner{''}.
   Application to some rainfall data from southern Israel shows that the
   new test can sometimes yield higher levels of statistical significance
   than linear regression when applied to the same data. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Historical precipitation, temperature and streamflow data for the
   Susquehanna River Basin (SRB) are analyzed with the objective of
   developing simple statistical and water balance models of streamflow at
   the watershed's outlet. Annual streamflow is highly correlated with
   annual precipitation (r(2) = 0.895) and, on a percent basis, changes in
   annual streamflow ((Q) over bar) are about two times greater than
   changes in annual precipitation ((P) over bar). Variations in (P) over
   bar - (Q) over bar, interpreted as annual evapotranspiration, are much
   smaller than variations in (P) over bar and (Q) over bar, and are weakly
   positively correlated with annual mean temperature in accordance with
   potential evapotranspiration formulae. Streamflow is monotonically
   related to diagnosed storage of water in the SRB from April through
   November. Deviations from this trend during winter are interpreted as
   changes in snowpack, and are in general agreement with climatological
   snow water equivalent estimates for the basin. A simple,
   spatially-lumped water balance model of the SRB is developed and shown
   to capture 99\% of the mean annual cycle and 75\% of the monthly
   streamflow from 1900 to 1987. Two ``downscaled{''} predictions of
   precipitation and one of temperature for a doubling of atmospheric CO2
   are used as inputs to the statistical and water balance models of the
   SRB. The result is an annual streamflow increase of 24 +/- 13\% (11.8
   +/- 6.7 cm). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{By the analysis of the observed time series of streamflow from
   catchments, the main components of the underlying groundwater balance,
   namely, discharge, evapotranspiration loss, storage and recharge, can be
   identified and quantified. This holistic las opposed to reductionist)
   estimation method is demonstrated for the Harris River catchment in
   southwest Western Australia. The relationship between the groundwater
   discharge and the reservoir storage of shallow unconfined aquifers was
   found to be nonlinear based on the analysis of numerous streamflow
   recession curves. However, depletion of groundwater by
   evapotranspiration losses, through the water uptake of tree roots, was
   found to bias the recession curves and the estimated reservoir
   parameters. As a result of the seasonality of both rainfall and
   potential evaporation, analysis of the recession curves, stratified
   according to time of the year, allowed the quantification of
   evapotranspiration loss as a function of calendar month and stored
   groundwater storage. Time series of recharge to the groundwater aquifer
   were computed from the observed total streamflows, and the estimated
   discharge and evapotranspiration losses, by inverse nonlinear reservoir
   routing. Using traditional unit hydrograph methods unit recharge
   responses to rainfall were computed by least squares fitting. The shapes
   of the estimated unit response functions showed no significant seasonal
   variation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To demonstrate the viability of using slug-test-analysis techniques to
   interpret recovery data in large-diameter, hand-dug wells, 37 wells
   representing a range of hydraulic conductivity and located in unconfined
   and weathered chalk and marl and confined alluvium in North-Central
   Texas were tested. Recovery data were analyzed by means of a numerical
   model, two semiempirical methods developed especially for interpreting
   recovery data from large-diameter hand-dug wells, and different
   slug-test-analysis methods that have different shape factors describing
   well geometry. Most hydraulic-conductivity values estimated by slug-test
   methods are within an order of magnitude of values that are estimated by
   using a numerical model or methods derived specifically for hand-dug
   wells. Because of the unique geometry of hand-dug wells (diameters on
   the same order as well lengths), care must be taken to ensure that the
   proper shape factors are used with slug-test methods. Because of the
   substantial well storage in hand-dug wells, considerable time may be
   required to lower the water level to the desired position, especially if
   pump capacity is limited. This pumping time results in a
   noninstantaneous withdrawal of water from the aquifer, which violates
   one of the assumptions of slug-test-interpretation methods. However, in
   low-permeability environments, reasonable results can still be attained
   if water removed from the well sources from well storage or if recovery
   time is considerably longer than pumping time. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The problem considered here is: how to measure the discharge from a
   raised min in terrain that is only partly mire-covered. The approach
   involves comparison of the stream discharge from a mixed mire and
   mineral-soil sub-catchment with that from a neighbouring non-mire
   sub-catchment. Inconclusive results have previously been obtained using
   naturally occurring chemical tracers, and the validity of an alternative
   area-separation method is now examined.
   Estimates of the mire component of discharge derived in this way and
   summed over periods of 7-12 days agree to within 1 mm day(-1) with
   estimates of mire discharge obtained by two other methods, namely direct
   measurement using mire lysimeters, and water-balance calculations using
   on-site rainfall measurements and evapotranspiration data calculated
   using the Penman-Monteith formula. The area-separation method may,
   therefore, be a useful adjunct or alternative to more expensive chemical
   methods for studying both the water yield of mixed catchments and
   aspects of peatland hydrology. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In some regions, measurements made at springs can be used to study
   regional hydrogeologic processes, and determine hydraulic and transport
   properties of aquifers. Here, input-output models, spectral analysis,
   and time series analysis are used to identify three different timescales
   characterizing discharge at springs. First, the ``hydraulic time
   scale{''} depends on the transmissivity of the aquifer and relates long
   term changes in discharge to long term changes in recharge. The
   hydraulic time scale will describe, for example, the secular decrease in
   discharge during a period of drought. A second hydraulic time scale,
   referred to as the ``time lag{''}, measures the time lag between
   groundwater recharge tin the studied examples, recharge is snowmelt
   during the springtime) and the time of peak discharge at the spring.
   Finally, the ``age{''} or mean residence time of groundwater represents
   the transport time of tracers and the volume of water in the aquifers.
   As examples, large discharge springs (typically several m(3)/s) in the
   Oregon and California Cascades are studied. These springs are associated
   with volcanic-hosted fracture-flow systems. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{It is well-known that the interrelationship between atmosphere and
   topography in a mountainous country like Austria produces more or less
   complicated patterns of climate variables. In particular, the spatial
   variability of precipitation data has often been the topic of research.
   For this study, the daily data from more than 400 precipitation stations
   in Austria recorded over a period of 20 years was used. The specific
   methodology developed in geostatistics which has become an important
   tool in climatology in the past 10 years, was used in the analysis. One
   of the most powerful instruments used to measure the temporal and
   spatial behavior of the variable explored, is the variogram. From the
   database of each station, we first calculated the most essential
   properties of the variogram in its general form, namely sill, range and
   nugget effect. Then we demonstrated how these variables may reveal
   interesting insights into the spatial structure of the temporal
   situation of precipitation in Austria. This method has yielded, for
   example, characteristic clusters of climatological features. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The sophistication of numerical methods that are available to solve the
   governing equation of unsaturated flow in soils (Richards' equation) far
   exceeds the ability to accurately estimate parametric functions of the
   equation. One of these parametric functions that defines the
   relationship between the capillary pressure and saturation (retention
   function) is usually obtained by fitting one of a number of available
   models to measured laboratory or field data. A second relationship, the
   hydraulic conductivity-saturation function can also be obtained by
   fitting to measured data. More often, the measured data of hydraulic
   conductivity is not available and a model of hydraulic
   conductivity-saturation function is obtained by using measured capillary
   pressure-saturation data. Such a hydraulic conductivity model that is
   widely used in soil physics applications was developed by Mualem
   (Mualem, Y,, 1976 Water. Resour, Res. 12 (3), 513-522), An empirical
   parameter in this model was obtained by fitting to retention data from
   non-sandy, agricultural field soils. This model also conceptualizes
   unsaturated flow to occur in pipes that assume no air-water interfaces.
   In most aquifer contamination problems sandy soils are encountered and
   the unsaturated flow in these soils is dominated by air-water
   interfaces. In a laboratory sand column experiment we have demonstrated
   that the Mualem's model under-predicts the hydraulic conductivity of
   sandy soils. A new model of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity that is
   specifically applicable for sandy soils is developed. This model
   approximates the sand grains by uniform spheres, and uses a flow
   geometry that allows for the incorporation of an air-water interface at
   the pore-scale. The model was then applied to predict the capillary
   pressure head in a laboratory sand column under conditions of vertical
   infiltration. The proposed model matched the observations much better
   compared to Mualem's model. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights

Abstract = {{There exists an impressive body of experimental evidence confirming the
   existence of power law relationships between various rainfall related
   variables. Many of these variables (such as rain rate, radar
   reflectivity factor and kinetic energy flux density) have a direct
   relevance for hydrology and related disciplines (hydrometeorology, soil
   erosion). There is one fundamental property of rainfall which ties all
   these variables together, namely the raindrop size distribution. It is
   the purpose of this article to explain (1) that there exist two
   fundamentally different forms of the raindrop size distribution, (2) how
   various hydrologically relevant rainfall variables are related to both
   these forms, and (3) how the coefficients of power law relationships
   between such rainfall variables are determined by the parameters of
   these two forms of the raindrop size distribution. The classical
   exponential raindrop size distribution is used as an example of a family
   of raindrop size distributions. Three groups of rainfall related
   variables are considered, namely properties of individual raindrops
   (size, speed, volume, mass, momentum and kinetic energy), rainfall
   integral variables (raindrop concentration, raindrop arrival rate,
   liquid rainwater content, rain rate, rainfall pressure, rainfall power
   and radar reflectivity factor) and characteristic Sizes (median-volume
   diameter, volume-weighted mean diameter and mean-volume diameter). Six
   different consistent sets of power law relationships between these
   rainfall related variables and rain rate are presented, based on
   different assumptions regarding the rain rate dependence of the
   parameters of the raindrop size distribution. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{In studies of the potential effects of global climate change on
   freshwater ecosystems, water temperature is a primary factor. Linear
   regressions of stream temperature versus air temperature are attractive
   for this purpose, because they require only one input variable (air
   temperature) which can be simulated by General Circulation Models (GCMs)
   better than other climate variables. Under a warmer climate scenario,
   high stream temperatures must be projected by extrapolation. The
   question arises whether linear extrapolation is valid.
   To answer the question, the heat exchange processes that contribute to
   surface water temperature have been analyzed and related to air
   temperature on a weekly time scale. The equilibrium temperature concept
   introduced by Edinger has been used. In stream reaches with large
   drainage area, stream temperature can be approximated by equilibrium
   temperature. At elevated air temperatures, the vapor pressure deficit
   above a water surface increases drastically (even in humid regions)
   causing strong evaporative cooling and hence a flatter stream
   temperature/air temperature relationship. At low air temperatures,
   stream temperatures often reach 0 degrees C as an asymptote. If an
   upstream flow control (dam, reservoir release) or a waste heat input is
   present, the lower asymptotic value can be larger than 0 degrees C. As a
   result of these upper and lower constraints for stream temperatures, the
   stream temperature/air temperature relationship resembles an S-shaped
   function rather than a straight line. Linear extrapolations to high and
   low air temperatures are therefore not justified. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Optical Spectro Pluviometer (OSP), an infrared optical device, is
   used to measure the rain drop size, fail velocity and intensity. The
   OSP, which works on the principle of measuring an optical shadow,
   enables independent measurement of drop size and drop velocity in real
   time and thus any parameter linked to rain erosivity. Simulated rain
   characteristics measured with the OSP are reported. Calibrations made in
   the laboratory using single raindrops allow an estimation of the
   accuracy Of drop size and velocity measurements. The single drop
   calibration shows that drop diameters are measured with an accuracy that
   is at least 6\% in the range 0.3-4.7 mm. Larger drops are detected but
   without quantification of their diameter. The accuracy in the drop fall
   velocity measurements varies from 1\% for the lowest velocity (0.2 m
   s(-1)) to 20\% for the highest velocity (10 m s(-1)). Simulated and
   natural raindrop-size distributions measured by the OSP are compared
   with distribution obtained by the filter paper method. Taking into
   account the uncertainties associated with the two methods, the
   raindrop-size distributions derived from the OSP and the filter paper
   method are in good agreement. To complete the calibration, rain
   intensity is derived from the raindrop-size distribution measurements
   and compared with values measured by a nearby rain gauge. For rain
   intensities less than 35 mm h(-1) the OSP underestimates intensity by
   12\%. However, for rain intensities in excess of 35 mm h(-1), the OSP
   underestimates intensity by 38\%. The errors on the two widely used rain
   erosivity indices, the kinetic energy and the momentum, are estimated to
   be less than 4\%. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrology of a cutover fen was studied from May to October in 1995
   and 1996. Rainfall equivalent depths were measured every 15 min and
   stream runoff was continuously monitored. Water table depths were
   measured bi-weekly during 1995 and continuously during 1996. Storm
   runoff was separated into different components; rain falling directly
   into channels and rapid groundwater response based on a contributing
   area method and on different electrical conductivities of rain-, ground-
   and streamwater. The results show three sources of storm runoff from
   cutover fens. Frequent small runoff peaks were caused by rain falling
   directly into channels. The amount of quick runoff increased when rain
   fell on wet soil, resulting in intermediate sized runoff peaks generated
   by rapid groundwater response. The largest runoff values were observed
   after prolonged rainfall when water from the upper part of the catchment
   flooded the fen. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mean annual infiltration above the high-level waste repository proposed
   to be sited at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, has a large impact on assessments
   of repository performance. Ongoing investigations of infiltration
   processes have identified the relatively horizontal caprock environment
   above portions of the repository as a potentially large source of
   infiltrating waters, due to shallow, permeable soils above a moderately
   welded tuff with large soil-filled fissures. The combination of shallow
   soils and fissured bedrock allows rapid penetration of wetting pulses to
   below the rooting zone. Plant uptake can strongly reduce net
   infiltration in arid environments with high water storage capacity, and,
   despite the low water storage capacity, there is a relatively high
   vegetation density in this environment. The apparent discrepancy between
   high vegetation density and low water storage motivates the study of
   plant-hydrologic interactions in this semiarid environment. Field
   observations were coupled with plant- and landscape-scale models to
   provide insight into plant-hydrologic interactions. Several lines of
   evidence, including: (i) linear plant growth features observed on aerial
   photographs; (ii) comparisons of plant cover within the fissured
   environment and comparable environments lacking fissures; and (iii)
   direct excavations, all suggest that the widely spaced soil-filled
   fissures are conducive to plant growth even when fissures are buried at
   soil depths exceeding 30 cm. Results from a mechanistic simulation model
   for root growth into fissures suggest that the additional (sheltered)
   plant-available soil water within fissures provides a competitive
   advantage for plant establishment. Therefore, plants that germinate
   above a fissure are more likely to survive, in turn developing linear
   features above fissures. Having established that plants preferentially
   root within soil-filled fissures in the caprock environment, a set of
   simulations were performed to examine the hydrologic consequence of
   plant roots within fissures at the landscape-scale. The response to
   three rainfall amounts was simulated. For the largest storm, fluxes at
   the fissure bottom peaked at 1-4 weeks after the storm when plant uptake
   was not active, but were eliminated when fissures had active vegetation.
   When plants were active within a fissure, uptake eliminated net
   infiltration in the fissure regardless of the size of the storm. Two
   plant-related mechanisms reduced total flux through the plant-filled
   fissures: (i) transpiration during fissure flow, and (ii) wetting-pulse
   retardation due to drier fissures prior to rain. The first mechanism
   appears to be dominant in these simulations. Results suggest that
   transpiration may strongly limit net infiltration (i.e. total deep
   percolation flux escaping the plant root zone); significant infiltration
   can occur, however, when plants are dormant, so that most infiltration
   would be expected to occur during winter. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Discharge and suspended-sediment concentration in the proglacial river
   draining the debris-covered summer-accumulation type Dokriani glacier,
   Ganga river basin, India, was measured between May and October 1994. In
   the meltwater streams of the Ganga headwater, the pattern of sediment
   transport is strongly influenced by the monsoonal precipitation between
   July and mid-September. During this observation period a total discharge
   volume of 6238 x 10(4) m(3) and 15 x 10(4) tonnes of suspended-sediment
   was delivered from the catchment. The monsoonal months of July and
   August accounted for 64\% of the discharge, 70\% of suspended-sediment
   transport and 74\% of the monsoonal rainfall. The focus of the present
   study is to estimate the contribution of glaciers in the
   monsoon-dominated central part of the Himalaya to sediment transport in
   the Himalayan rivers. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A comprehensive reference system for the Earth's river basins is
   proposed as a support to river basin management, global change research,
   and the pursuit of sustainable development. A natural system for
   delineation and codification of basins is presented which is based upon
   topographic control and the topology of the river network. These
   characteristics make the system well suited for implementation and use
   with digital elevation models (DEMs) and geographic information systems.
   A demonstration of these traits is made with the 30-arcsecond GTOPO30
   DEM for North America. The system has additional appeal owing to its
   economy of digits and the topological information that they carry. This
   is illustrated through presentation of comparisons with USGS hydrologic
   unit codes and demonstration of the use of code numbers to reveal
   dependence or independence of water use activities within a basin. (C)

Title = {{Investigation and comparison of sampling properties of L-moments and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{218}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{13-34}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{The first part of this article deals with fitting of regression
   equations for the sampling properties, variance of L-standard deviation
   (l(2)), and bias and variance of L-skewness (t(3)), based on Monte-Carlo
   simulation results, for generalised Normal (Lognormal-3) and Pearson-3
   distributions. These fitted equations will be useful in formulating
   goodness-of-fit test statistics in regional frequency analysis. The
   second part presents a comparison of the sampling properties between
   L-moments and conventional product moments for generalised Normal,
   generalised Extreme Value, generalised Pareto and Pearson-3
   distributions, in a relative form. The comparison reveals that the bias
   in L-skewness is found to be insignificant up to a skewness of about
   1.0, even for small samples. In case of higher skewness, for a
   reasonable sample size of 30, L-skewness is found to be nearly unbiased.
   However, the conventional skewness is found to be significantly biased,
   even for a low skewness of 0.5 and a reasonable sample size of 30. The
   overall performance evaluation in terms of ``Relative-RMSE in third
   moment ratio{''} reveals that conventional moments are preferable at
   lower skewness, particularly for smaller samples, while L-moments are
   preferable at higher skewness, for all sample sizes. This point is
   illustrated through an application that seeks to obtain an appropriate
   regional flood frequency distribution for the 98 catchment areas located
   in the central region of India, spread over six hydrometeorologic
   subzones. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is widely used to measure the soil water
   contents. The effect of soil composition on TDR calibration has to be
   quantified to diminish the need in re-calibration of TDR. Our objectives
   were: (a) to evaluate the ability of published models to fit TDR
   calibration data for the soils of different texture, and (b) to explore
   using a piecewise-constant distribution to approximate the continuous
   dependence of the dielectric constant on the position of water within
   soil pore space. We calibrated TDR in sand-kaolin mixtures,
   dernovo-podzolic soil, gray forest soil, and leached chernozem. Distinct
   changes in slopes of the calibration curves were observed for the
   fine-textured samples in the range of volumetric water contents from
   0.13 to 0.27. The ratio of the lack-of-fit mean square error and the
   mean square pure error was used as a statistic for the error comparison
   to conclude whether a model provided a satisfactory fit of data.
   Published models that did not have parameters to adjust fitted well data
   for coarse-textured mixtures and soils but failed to fit data for fine
   textured mixtures and soils. The piecewise-constant distribution model
   with three adjustable parameters fitted well all data. Parameters of
   this model were related to clay content in the samples. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Deeply weathered landscapes occur throughout equatorial regions and are
   transformed by cycles of deep weathering and stripping. These processes
   are driven by rainfall that infiltrates the subsurface-as groundwater
   recharge or runs across the landsurface. Recent work in Uganda
   demonstrates that long-term (10(5)-10(6)a) cycles of deep weathering and
   stripping are tectonically controlled. The influence of tectonics on the
   present-day hydrological regime and hence, contemporary geomorphic
   process, is examined in this study. The hydrological characteristics of
   two humid basins in Uganda were determined using soil-moisture balance
   techniques, hydrograph separation methods, borehole hydrographs and
   stable isotope (H-2, O-18) tracers. These were, in turn, related to the
   dominant geomorphic process (deep weathering or stripping) suggested by
   the local tectonic history. In central Uganda, where deep weathering of
   the landsurface has occurred since the Miocene, soil-moisture balance
   calculations, monitoring-well records and stable isotope data show that
   groundwater recharge is derived from monsoon rainfall, is in the order
   of 120 mm a(-1) and greatly exceeds surface runoff of 3-4 mm a(-1).
   Basin output occurs as evapotranspiration from a wetland that runs
   centrally through the catchment. Consistency in this discharge, despite
   highly seasonal rainfall, reflects a large basin storage that is,
   permitted by a thick weathered mantle. In south-western Uganda, where
   stripping of the landsurface has occurred since the mid-Pleistocene,
   soil-moisture balance calculations and hydrograph separation techniques
   indicate groundwater recharge is restricted to years of exceptionally
   high rainfall. Annual surface runoff (34 mm a(-1)) generated primarily
   from monsoon rainfall events, exceeds the recharge flux (8-15 mm a(-1)).
   Streamflow discharge varies considerably (from 0.2 to > 14 m(3) s(-1))
   and occurs along well-incised drainage channels. The comparatively
   smaller basin storage results from a thinner, partially stripped
   weathered mantle. The influence of tectonics is indicated by the
   conclusion that deep weathering, associated with prolonged tectonic
   stability in central Uganda, is facilitated by a recharge-dominated
   hydrological regime whereas stripping, prompted by mid-Pleistocene
   tectonic uplift in south-western Uganda, continues to occur under a
   runoff-dominated regime. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to test the ability of a distributed
   meteorological/hydrologic model to simulate the hydrologic response to
   three single-storm events passing over the Upper West Branch of the
   Susquehanna River Basin. The high-resolution precipitation fields for
   three storms are provided by observations and by the Penn State-NCAR
   Mesoscale Meteorological Model (MM5) with three nested domains. The MM5
   simulation successfully captures the storm patterns over the study area,
   although some temporal and spatial discrepancies exist between observed
   and simulated precipitation fields. Observed and simulated precipitation
   data for those storms are used to drive the Hydrologic Model System
   (HMS). The output from HMS is compared to the measured hydrographic
   streamflow at the outlet of the Upper West Branch. The Curve Number and
   Green-Ampt methods of rainfall-runoff partitioning are used in HMS and
   evaluated for streamflow simulation. The results of the hydrologic
   simulation compare well with observed data when using the Curve Number
   partitioning, but underestimate observed data when using the Green-Ampt.
   The likely cause is the lack of heterogeneity in hydraulic parameters.
   The simulated streamflow with the MMS-simulated precipitation is lower
   than the simulated streamflow with observed precipitation. The
   experiments suggest that the subgrid-scale spatial variability in
   precipitation and hydraulic parameters should be included in future
   model development (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In a recently published paper on simulation and analyses of water and
   carbon fluxes at the NOPEX central site, a modeling exercise indicated a
   rather strong sink of carbon for the studied forest stand and year
   (1994). At the 100-m high tower, the eddy-flux measurements stretch out
   to the present day. They show that the surrounding forest area is a
   rather weak source of carbon. This note clarifies the previously
   published numbers in view of several new findings at the site since the
   paper preparation (1995) up to the publishing/present date (1998/1999).
   The key issues that could not be adopted three years ago, were (i)
   footprint analyses of the eddy-covariance measurements, (ii) correction
   of eddy-flux data for night-time, and (iii) information on carbon flux
   from soil. These complementary findings address the previous
   uncertainties in carbon budget assessment and model parameterization and
   suggest improvements to model application and better match the measured
   data. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Seven nested headwater catchments (8 to 161 ha) were monitored during
   five summer rain events to evaluate storm runoff components and the
   effect of catchment size on water sources. Two-component isotopic
   hydrograph separation showed that event-water contributions near the
   time of peakflow ranged from 49\% to 62\% in the 7 catchments during the
   highest intensity event. The proportion of event water in stormflow was
   greater than could be accounted for by direct precipitation onto
   saturated areas. DOC concentrations in stormflow were strongly
   correlated with stream O-18 composition. Bivariate mixing diagrams
   indicated that the large event water contributions were likely derived
   from flow through the soil O-horizon. Results from two-tracer,
   three-component hydrograph separations showed that the throughfall and
   O-horizon soil-water components together could account for the estimated
   contributions of event water to stormflow. End-member mixing analysis
   confirmed these results. Estimated event-water contributions were
   inversely related to catchment size, but the relation was significant
   for only the event with greatest rainfall intensity. Our results suggest
   that perched, shallow subsurface flow provides a substantial
   contribution to summer stormflow in these small catchments, but the
   relative contribution of this component decreases with catchment size.

Abstract = {{The transformation of hydrologic processes from nonstationarity to
   stationarity with increasing scales is investigated. The fundamental
   mechanism of this transformation is the coarse-graining of hydrologic
   processes by aliasing and averaging operations. These operations are
   investigated by means of spectral relationships and hydrologic
   conservation equations. It is shown that hydrologic conservation
   equations at large scales may still be parsimonious due to the
   coarse-graining of hydrologic processes with increasing scales. When a
   larger scale process is formed by averaging a smaller scale process, the
   high frequency components of the smaller scale process are eliminated by
   the averaging operation, rendering the average hydrologic conservation
   equations to be quite simple in form. It is also shown that for the
   ensemble average form of a hydrologic conservation equation to be
   equivalent to its volume-average form, the parameter functions of that
   conservation equation at the immediately smaller scale must be ergodic.

Abstract = {{The spatial scale of soil moisture measurements is often inconsistent
   with the scale at which soil moisture predictions are needed.
   Consequently a change of scale (upscaling or downscaling) from the
   measurements to the predictions or model values is needed. The
   measurement or model scale can be defined as a scale triplet, consisting
   of spacing, extent and support. `Spacing' refers to the distance between
   samples; `extent' refers to the overall coverage; and `support' refers
   to the area integrated by each sample. The statistical properties that
   appear in the data, the apparent variance and the apparent correlation
   length, are as a rule different from their true values because of bias
   introduced by the measurement scale. In this paper, high-resolution soil
   moisture data from the 10.5 ha Tarrawarra catchment in south-eastern
   Australia are analysed to assess this bias quantitatively. For each
   survey up to 1536 data points in space are used. This allows a change of
   scale of two orders of magnitude. Apparent variances and apparent
   correlation lengths are calculated in a resampling analysis. Apparent
   correlation lengths always increase with increasing spacing, extent or
   support. The apparent variance increases with increasing extent,
   decreases with increasing support, and does not change with spacing. All
   of these sources of bias are a function of the ratio of measurement
   scale (in terms of spacing, extent and support) and the scale of the
   natural variability (i.e. the true correlation length or process scale
   of soil moisture). In a second step this paper examines whether the bias
   due to spacing, extent and support can be predicted by standard
   geostatistical techniques of regularisation and variogram analysis. This
   is done because soil moisture patterns have properties, such as
   connectivity, that violate the standard assumptions underlying these
   geostatistical techniques. Therefore, it is necessary to test the
   robustness of these techniques by application to observed data. The
   comparison indicates that these techniques are indeed applicable to
   organised soil moisture fields and that the bias is predicted equally
   well for organised and random soil moisture patterns. A number of
   examples are given to demonstrate the implications of these results for
   hydrologic modelling and sampling design. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Numerical experiments have been carried out with a
   soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) model to study the impact of
   spatial variability in soil and land surface parameters on
   regional-scale water balance components. A statistical-dynamical
   approach has been used to account for the spatial variability of the
   selected parameters and to determine the seasonal evolution of the
   impact on the water budget. Point data are used to derive
   probability-density functions for the thickness of the permeable top
   soil layer, coefficients for the water retention and hydraulic
   conductivity curves, the leaf area index and the minimum stomatal
   resistance. These distributions are incorporated in the model's
   mathematical framework in order to generate univariate distributions
   (sensitivity patterns) for evaporation, transpiration, total evaporation
   and runoff. The means of these univariate distributions of outputs yield
   catchment-scale averages. Next, the study obtains catchment-scale
   evaporation estimates by running simulations with aggregated parameters
   obtained as statistical descriptors of parameter distributions. The
   difference between the catchment-scale averages and values obtained with
   aggregated parameters describes the non-linear response of the model to
   spatial variability of the particular parameter. Finally, the study also
   investigates several effective parameters based on recently described
   hydrometeorological aggregation rules. Results show significant
   differences in sensitivity patterns between individual parameters and
   between seasons. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A typical feature of the land surface is its heterogeneity in terms of
   the spatial variability of land surface characteristics and parameters
   controlling physical/hydrological, biological, and other related
   processes. Different forms and degrees of heterogeneity need to be taken
   into account in hydrological modelling. The first part of the article
   concerns the conditions under which a disaggregation of the land surface
   into subareas of uniform or `'quasihomogeneous'' behaviour (hydrotopes
   or hydrological response units - HRUs) is indispensable. In a case study
   in northern Germany, it is shown that forests in contrast to arable
   land, areas with shallow groundwater in contrast to those with deep,
   water surfaces and sealed areas should generally be distinguished
   (disaggregated) in modelling, whereas internal heterogeneities within
   these hydrotopes can be assessed statistically, e.g., by areal
   distribution functions (soil water holding capacity, hydraulic
   conductivity, etc.). Models with hydrotope-specific parameters can be
   applied to calculate the ``vertical{''} processes (fluxes, storages,
   etc.), and this, moreover, for hydrotopes of different area, and even
   for groups of distributed hydrotopes in a reference area (hydrotope
   classes), provided that the meteorological conditions are similar. Thus,
   a scaling problem does not really exist in this process domain. The
   primary domain for the application of scaling laws is that of lateral
   flows in landscapes and river basins. This is illustrated in the second
   part of the article, where results of a case study in Bavaria/Germany
   are presented and discussed. It is shown that scaling laws can be
   applied efficiently for the determination of the Instantaneous Unit
   Hydrograph (IUH) of the surface runoff system in river basins: simple
   scaling for basins larger than 43 km(2), and multiple scaling for
   smaller basins. Surprisingly, only two parameters were identified as
   important in the derived relations: the drainage area and, in some
   cases, the elevation a.s.l.. The scaling exponent was determined as
   equal or approximately equal to the exponent 0.566 in Hack's law.
   Therefore, it is suggested that there is some relation between the
   scaling laws and the fractal nature of river networks, and accordingly
   with the complex dynamics of the interacting hydrological and
   geomorphological processes in river basins. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to model the influence of land use on
   catchment runoff. The modeling is based on the subdivision of the
   catchment into smaller units by generation of the so-called
   ``hydrologically similar units{''} (HSU) or ``patch types{''}. HSUs
   aggregate areas of hydrologically similar behavior, e.g., land use,
   soil, slope, and vegetation. Each HSU is represented using a
   cross-section called a `'characteristic profile''. For the calculation
   of the water balance of the characteristic profiles, a mathematical
   treatment of the key partitions of the hydrograph response was
   developed. The characteristic profile is the largest unit that can be
   handled mathematically still maintaining the idea of a hydrologically
   similar regime. An agricultural characteristic profile is a
   cross-section between two parallel open ditches or sub-surface drains.
   For forest areas the characteristic profile is called hillslope and the
   length of the hillslope can vary from few meters up to hundreds of
   meters. The total runoff from the characteristic profiles is an input to
   a channel network. In the present model, the channel processes are
   described using the geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph (GIUH).
   The proposed hydrological model was tested in the Lestijoki catchment
   (1290 km(2)) located in western Finland. The catchment was subdivided
   into 25 characteristic profiles with parameters tired to typical values
   measured in Finnish conditions. The model calibration was carried out
   for the GIUH parameters using measured every-day river flow. The
   coefficient of determination was 0.74 for a 2-y calibration period, and
   0.70 for a 3-y testing period, The model represented well the extent of
   variable contributing areas, which was the main reason for the
   non-linear behavior of the catchment response. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A simple and pragmatic technique for modelling streamwater acidity in a
   major Scottish catchment, the River Dee in Aberdeenshire, is presented.
   Based on End Member Mixing Analysis (EMMA), the technique is used to
   predict daily streamwater concentrations of Gran alkalinity and calcium
   at a range of spatial scales (1-690 km(2)). For a given site anywhere
   within the upland region of the catchment, the streamwater end member
   compositions are estimated from geological, soil and land cover data
   using a Geographical Information System (GIS). The utility of the
   approach is demonstrated by the predicted streamwater Gran alkalinity
   and calcium concentrations matching with a reasonable degree of accuracy
   those observed in the field. There are two assumptions: (i) the
   streamwater is composed of two end members and (ii) the end members are
   temporally invariant. The accuracy of the model predictions suggests
   that these two assumptions are reasonable, at least to a first
   approximation in large (> 50 km(2)) catchments. To model environmental
   change the technique must be linked to process based models, which
   predict how end members will change over time. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This study is focused on analyses of scale dependency of lumped
   hydrological models with different formulations of the infiltration
   processes. Three lumped hydrological models of differing complexity were
   used in the study: the SAC-SMA model, the Oregon State University (OSU)
   model, and the simple water balance (SWB) model. High-resolution (4 x 4
   km) rainfall estimates from the next generation weather radar (NEXRAD)
   Stage III in the Arkansas-Red river basin were used in the study. These
   gridded precipitation estimates are a multi-sensor product which
   combines the spatial resolution of the radar data with the ground truth
   estimates of the gage data. Results were generated from each model using
   different resolutions of spatial averaging of hourly rainfall. Although
   all selected models were scale dependent, the level of dependency varied
   significantly with different formulations of the rainfall-runoff
   partitioning mechanism. Infiltration-excess type models were the most
   sensitive. Saturation-excess type models were less scale dependent.
   Probabilistic averaging of the point processes reduces scale dependency,
   however, its effectiveness varies depending on the scale and the spatial
   structure of rainfall. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Conventional climate observation networks are often deficient in both
   quantity and quality of data for macroscale hydrological modelling. In
   this sense we regard a basin as macroscale if it exceeds 10 000 km(2).
   Atmospheric models such as general circulation models (GCM) and
   numerical weather prediction models (NWP) provide alternative sources of
   data in such cases. While there are many questions concerning the
   accuracy of the hydrologically-relevant output from such models,
   experience has shown good results in hydrological modelling of
   macroscale northern basins. The spatial scale of climate data used in
   the hydrological modelling has varied from 3.75 degrees (similar to 400
   km at 60 degrees) for GCM data to 4 km for data from a high resolution
   boundary layer model. The time periods used have varied from a few days
   for NWP data to almost a century for data from the high resolution
   boundary layer model. Comparisons of hydrological model outputs using
   data from various atmospheric models for the 37 000 km(2) upper Columbia
   Basin and the 1.8 million km(2) Mackenzie Basin in north-western Canada
   are given. The experience gained in such one-way off-line coupling of
   atmospheric and hydrological models will be useful in developing a
   global model of the full hydrological cycle with two-way linking of
   atmospheric, oceanic and hydrological models. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This article describes the development, application and validation of a
   macro-scale hydrological model, designed to simulate streamflow from
   climatic inputs over a large geographic domain. The model is a daily
   water balance model, which assumes that the soil moisture storage
   capacity varies statistically across the catchment: all other catchment
   properties, and climatic inputs, are assumed constant across the
   catchment. Model parameters are derived, directly or indirectly, from
   digital spatial data bases. The model is currently implemented at a
   spatial resolution of 0.5 x 0.5 degrees (approximately 2000 km(2)),
   because that is the resolution of the currently available climatic input
   data. In fact, the article emphasises how the form, parameterisation and
   quality of simulated output are strongly determined by the quality and
   characteristics of the data used both to define model parameters and to
   run the model. The article illustrates the model tuning process-which
   includes assessment of the input data-using the example of an
   application in Europe. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We sampled an east-central Pennsylvania watershed to investigate
   controls on baseflow and the associated water quality in the upland
   agricultural watershed setting. Tributaries and upgradient reaches of
   two main streams exhibited increasing flow from influent groundwater,
   but rates of increase were different depending on topographic position.
   Approximately midway through the watershed, the main streams showed loss
   of flow to groundwater, but reverted to gaining conditions near the
   watershed outlet, a zone of groundwater discharge. Tributaries draining
   a forested ridge exhibited low ionic concentrations, while those
   originating within agricultural areas exhibited higher concentrations of
   all ions, including NO3-N upto 20 mg l(-1). These concentrations
   represent drainage from a surficial aquifer with water quality affected
   by overlying land use. From midway down the main streams to the
   watershed outlet, baseflow exhibited stable and moderate chemical
   concentrations; Ca, Mg, SO4, Cl, NO3, and HCO3 were the dominant ions,
   and NO3-N concentrations were about 5 mg l(-1). A simple model was
   developed to explain nitrate concentrations within baseflow. It showed
   that nitrate was predictable down to the subwatershed scale based on
   percentage of major land use categories. Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The fluorescence properties of groundwaters percolating into four cave
   systems have been monitored over the period 1997-1998. Fluorescence was
   excited between 220 and 400 nm and the emission measured from 300 to 500
   nm using a fluorescence spectrophotometer. Three fluorescence centres
   were observed; one at the excitation-emission pair of 290-340:395-430
   nm, (humic-like, probably fulvic acid), one at 265-280:300-370 nm
   (protein like) and a less defined region of high fluorescence at
   230-280:310-420 nm (humic and/or protein like). The most consistent
   fluorescence intensity was observed in the excitation-emission pair of
   290-340:395-430 nm, attributed to a fulvic acid source. Subtle
   differences (+/- 5\%) in the fluorescence excitation and emission
   wavelength of this fluorescence peak in the groundwater were observed
   between the four sites, and the fluorescence intensity varied
   considerably (x 60) between the four sites. Both the wavelength and the
   intensity variations in fluorescence are caused by the differences in
   the vegetation cover, soil type and humification. Data from the most
   intensely monitored site (Brown's Folly Mine, England; 9 sample
   stations, 10-20 days frequency sampling) revealed no spatial variability
   in the 290-340:395-430 nm (fulvic acid) fluorescence; in contrast
   time-series analysis suggests that the seasonal variations do occur,
   with a decrease in the emission wavelength correlating with the first
   (autumn) peak in fluorescence intensity, and a decrease in the
   excitation wavelength correlating with a second (winter) fluorescence
   intensity peak. Results demonstrate the potential of utilising
   fluorescence wavelength variations in sourcing karst groundwaters, and
   as a possible palaeoenvironmental proxy of the overlying soil conditions
   if trapped within the cave speleothems. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{We have used a geographic information system (GIS) to study the
   relationships between streamwater pH and alkalinity at base flow with
   geology, soils and relief in 100 forested catchments located in the
   sandstone portion of the Vosges mountains, where atmospheric deposition
   and forest cover can be considered homogeneous. At base flow,
   streamwater acidity depends primarily on bedrock and soil content of
   weatherable minerals whose dissolution neutralizes acidity. Catchments
   are developed on three main stratigraphic levels, consisting of two
   sandstone layers rich in weatherable minerals, called `'rich'', at the
   upper and lower extremity of the stratigraphic sequence, and a
   quartzitic sandstone, called `'poor'', in between. Catchments were
   classified into three major groups in relation to the stratigraphic
   sequence: (1) only `'poor'' bedrock, (2) `'rich'' upstream and `'poor''
   downstream, (3) `'poor'' upstream and `'rich'' downstream. Results
   showed that streamwater pH differed depending on the group. Within each
   group, the pH was related to bedrock, soil and relief characteristics of
   the catchments. The relative surface covered by the bedrock located in
   the lower part of the catchment explained more than 50\% of the
   variability of pH. More than 20\% of variability could be explained by
   soil types in catchments composed of ``poor{''} bedrock only. Soil type
   apparently did not influence streamwater pH in the other groups. The
   catchment area, probably related to the increase of soil volume and
   water residence time, explained up to 20\% of pH variability, depending
   on the catchment type. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We have investigated capture time through a horizontal well fur several
   types of aquifers. We have studied two scenarios in which wells are at
   the middle and at the bottom (or the top) of an aquifer. We have
   obtained the closed-form analytical solutions of capture times for these
   two scenarios in homogeneous, confined aquifers for both isotropic and
   anisotropic cases. We have discussed the applicability and the
   limitation of the analytical solutions. The presence of confining
   boundaries in vertical direction constrains the vertical flow, but
   enhances the horizontal Bow. The presence of anisotropy with a smaller
   vertical conductivity further limits the vertical Row and increases the
   horizontal Row. We have conducted numerical simulations to obtain
   capture times, and found that they were very close to the analytical
   solutions, given the same conditions. We have further analyzed the
   advantages and disadvantages of two different methods of simulating a
   horizontal well (uniform nux and uniform head). (C) 1999 Elsevier

   Variability of delta(A), an atmospheric characteristic determined by
   air-mass origin and history, is a potentially useful tracer of synoptic
   atmospheric variations, and is an important control on isotopic
   behaviour of open-water bodies during surface-atmosphere exchange and
   evaporation. Flux-weighted delta(A) estimation using class A evaporation
   pans may be a practical alternative to precipitation or direct vapour
   sampling in dry climates, and is well-suited to short-term isotope mass

Abstract = {{As a first step towards coupling atmospheric and hydrological models,
   this article describes the implementation of the Interface Soil
   Biosphere Atmosphere (ISBA) surface scheme within a macroscale
   hydrological model at the regional scale. The introduction of the
   diurnal cycle in the hydrological model allows a coupling with the
   atmosphere through the energy balance and water budget computations. The
   coupled model is used in a forced mode, i.e. atmospheric forcing is
   imposed on the surface scheme without any retroaction of the surface
   exchanges on the atmosphere. The initial version of ISBA was modified to
   account for sub-grid runoff. Existing classifications of soil and
   vegetation at high spatial resolution (1 km) were used in conjunction
   with satellite information to monitor the monthly evolution of the
   vegetation. A dense surface network facilitated the interpolation of
   atmospheric fields with a time step of 3 h, The two years considered
   show large differences of annual precipitation and potential
   evaporation, which have an impact on the regime of the river flows. A
   one-dimensional study presents the sensitivity of the partitioning of
   precipitation into evaporation and runoff to the sub-grid runoff and
   drainage parameterizations, soil depth, and vegetation cover. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{A macroscale hydrological model including an improved representation of
   the surface processes is validated at a regional scale using the data
   set collected during the Hapex-Mobilhy experiment (1986), Using observed
   atmospheric forcing with a resolution of 5 km and realistic fields of
   vegetation and soil types in a large area, the hydrological model
   correctly simulates daily streamflows for two contrasting climatological
   years in 1986 and 1987, provided that a sub-grid scale parameterization
   of surface runoff is included in the surface scheme. The comparison with
   point observations of evaporation and soil water content shows that the
   surface scheme satisfactorily reproduces the annual water budget for
   very diverse land uses, It is shown that, although the annual rainfall
   was significantly lower in 1987, the annual evaporation was higher than
   in 1986 because precipitation fell mainly in summer. The reduction of
   precipitation contributed to a comparable reduction of total runoff, and
   therefore a drastic decrease in the river flows as confirmed by the
   observations. The second part of the study addresses the issue of
   modelling the surface water budget at a large grid scale. Once
   validated, the macroscale hydrological model is used as a reference to
   test aggregation methods. Aggregated fluxes of evaporation, drainage and
   surface runoff are found to be close to the reference fluxes provided
   that sub-grid scale surface runoff and interception losses are taken
   into account in the aggregation procedure. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A method based on fuzzy set theory is presented to incorporate imprecise
   thermodynamic parameters into chemical equilibrium calculations of
   aqueous systems. Imprecision may arise from uncertainties in
   experimental parameter determination as well as from inconsistency of
   available data in the literature. Fuzzy numbers with different shapes of
   membership functions are used to express imprecision in a
   non-probabilistic sense. A solution algorithm for a system of nonlinear
   algebraic equations calculating the chemical equilibrium composition is
   combined with level set operations to solve the fuzzy chemical
   equlibrium problem. The method results in multiple minimizing/maximizing
   procedures from which the membership functions of equilibrium species
   concentrations are determined. An application of the proposed method to
   an aqueous cadmium-sulfide system illustrates the acquisition of
   membership functions for the thermodynamic constants out of given
   information. Stochastic information on measurement data are
   appropriately transformed into fuzzy numbers to allow for the combined
   calculation of different kinds of uncertainty. The results of four
   calculation scenarios show their strong impact on the resulting
   membership functions of chemical equilibrium composition and are
   discussed in the context of data evaluation and decision making in
   geochemistry. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the effect of soil moisture deficit on the restriction of
   evaporation from bare soil surfaces, the process of evaporation in dry
   soil was investigated from field observations at a fallow site and a
   sand dune site. Analysis of the surface energy balance showed that soil
   drying affects not only the inter-diurnal variation of energy fluxes,
   but also their diurnal variation. In addition, the relationship between
   the surface resistance (r(s)) and soil water content (theta) of surface
   soil was found to be different between inter-diurnal and diurnal time
   scales. Stable isotopic analysis of soil water showed that liquid water
   transport from deeper soil layers stops at the bottom boundary of the
   dry surface layer (DSL) and that vapor water transport is dominant in
   the DSL. In addition, diurnal variations in water content and soil air
   humidity suggest that evaporation and condensation occurs alternatively
   within the DSL with diurnal cycle due to cyclic change in solar
   radiation and soil temperature. From these observational results, a
   conceptual model of the dynamics of the evaporation zone in dry sandy
   soils is presented. In the model, the evaporation zone consists of two
   sub-zones: a narrow sub-zone around the bottom boundary of the DSL, and
   a relatively wide sub-zone within the DSL. The former is active through
   a day and moves vertically with the development/reduction of the DSL at
   both diurnal and inter-diurnal time scales. The latter acts as
   evaporation zone only in the morning and acts as condensation zone in
   the late afternoon and at night. The dynamic behavior of the evaporation
   zone and those related to the form of water content profile can explain
   the difference in the r(s)-theta relationship between inter-diurnal and
   diurnal time scales. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   The solution extends an earlier study requiring some numerical

   Fundamentally, there is a very short time behavior associated with
   rainfall impact and a longer time behavior controlled by convection. It
   is this time decoupling which permits the solution to be expressed in

Abstract = {{In a series of three articles Calder, Hall and colleagues have recently
   presented an extension of Calder's original stochastic model of rainfall

   raindrop size is explicitly taken into account. All raindrops are
   assumed to have the same characteristic size, the so-called
   median-volume raindrop diameter D-0, which is taken to be a power law
   function of the rain rate R. However, the D-0-R relationship used in
   their model results from an erroneous interpretation of the general
   theory of the raindrop size distribution recently proposed by Sempere
   Torres and colleagues. As a result, this relationship is not consistent
   with the postulated underlying raindrop size distribution. Moreover, it
   seriously underestimates D-0 for a given R as compared to the
   consistently derived D-0-R relationships and to the D-0-R relationship
   reported in a classical article on the subject of raindrop size
   distributions. This may seriously affect the model results presented by

Abstract = {{In a recent series of three articles Calder, 1996; Calder et al.. 1996;
   and Hall et al., 1996 it was shown that an earlier stochastic model of
   rainfall interception could be developed to take account not only of the
   wetting up of vegetation by the primary impact of raindrops on
   vegetation canopies but also the wetting of lower layers of the canopy
   by impacts of secondary drops falling from the upper layers. It was
   shown that through the use of a rainfall simulator and an optical
   disdrometer (Hall and Calder, 1993), species specific wetting parameters
   could be determined which allowed, through the use of the model, the
   calculation of secondary drop size and the wetting up response of the
   vegetation. It was also suggested that through the use of relationships
   between raindrop size and rainfall intensity the primary drop size
   striking the canopy could be calculated. An example of the use of the
   model was given for a site in Sri Lanka which showed that the observed
   net rainfall distribution was much better described by this model, which
   explicitly takes into account drop size, than by conventional models of
   rainfall interception, which generally were developed in temperate
   climates, under relatively low rainfall intensity (small drop size)
   conditions. It was proposed that the use of the stochastic model helps
   to explain some of the range in interception losses which were observed
   world-wide.
   Because of the generally small drop sizes in the primary rainfall (low
   rainfall intensities) and secondary drop sizes (small leaves) the
   wetting of temperate coniferous forests is very efficient and leads
   towards some of the highest losses, in both in percentage and absolute
   terms, that were recorded from any forests. By contrast, tropical
   rainforest subject to wetting by large drops in the primary rainfall,
   (often high rainfall intensities), and large secondary drop size
   wetting, (large leaves), tends towards inefficient wetting and low
   interception losses.
   Uijlenhoet and Stricker (1999) have questioned the use of a relationship
   used in one part of the model, that relating to rainfall intensity and
   drop size, and point out an inconsistency in the interpretation of the
   Sempere Torres (Sempere Torres et al., 1994) general theory of raindrop
   size distributions. I am grateful to Uijlenhoet and Stricker fur
   pointing out this inconsistency and for showing that with a more
   realistic relationship between rainfall intensity and drop size, drop
   sizes will be larger for a given rainfall intensity than had been
   calculated originally. This will have the effect of making the
   ``stochastic{''} wetting effect of raindrops even more significant than
   had previously been anticipated, which would be most pronounced for
   sparse canopies growing in high rainfall intensity climates. For high
   leaf area canopies, whether growing in either temperate or tropical
   climates the effects of secondary wetting of drops falling from higher
   layers ill canopies will predominate.}},

Abstract = {{The Precordillera area of the Andes Mountains (Mendoza, Argentina) is
   affected by severe flash floods, caused by heavy rainfall events of
   short duration and high intensities. A, telemetric network, installed on
   a pilot zone since 1983, provided a set of about 150 rainfall events. In
   addition, about 50 hood events were recorded at the outlet of a 5.47
   km(2) catchment. The distributed model Areal Non-point Source Watershed
   Environment Response Simulation was adapted to this catchment and
   applied continuously over the period 1983-1994. The year 1985 was used
   for calibration. The model was able to reproduce runoff volume with an
   efficiency of 0.6, and peak discharge with an efficiency of 0.46. The
   largest events were however underestimated, although the model was able
   to reproduce the sharp increases in streamflow registered by the sensor.
   Based on the assumption that the model had captured the catchment
   behaviour, it was used to determine the main processes involved in
   runoff generation. The combination of rainfall and soil variability,
   mainly associated with a quasi-impervious area in the middle of the
   catchment, was found to explain the rapid increases in streamflow.
   Vegetation, surface storage capacity, and initial soil moisture were
   also influential but with a much smaller magnitude than the combination
   of rainfall and soil variability. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Water shortages commonly increase in frequency following forest
   clearance on lauds overlying karst in the tropics. The mechanism
   underlying this hydrologic change is likely to depend on the land use
   which follows forest cover. To determine the flow paths which prevail
   for a progression of land uses common to the uplands of Leyte,
   Philippines, samples of interflow were collected during the rainy season
   and titrated to determine their alkalinities. The ratio of the measured
   alkalinity to the value predicted by equilibrium calculations for each
   sample was used as an indication of the contact time of the water with
   the limestone. The responses of the alkalinity saturation ratio and the
   runoff depth to increasing rainfall depth were used to substantiate the
   hypothesis that epikarst infilling and changing soil structure create
   throttles to percolation and infiltration. The forest site was found to
   generate interflow primarily as pipe how, with the infiltration and
   percolation throttles rarely exceeded. Similarly, infiltration was not:
   limiting for the slash/mulch Site, however, level of soil disturbance
   was adequate to initiate a throttle at the epikarst which increased the
   volume of interflow generated. The total percolation was similar for the
   plowed and slash/mulch sites; however, the interflow was decreased at
   the plowed site by reduced infiltration at the soil surface. The
   throttles to surface infiltration and epikarst percolation were even
   greater at the pasture sites, resulting in high runoff generation.
   However, comparatively greater infiltration was observed in the pasture
   having contour-hedgerows. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Memory in hydrologic time series is analyzed by testing the null
   hypothesis that there is only short-term memory in the series. The
   original and a modified versions of the rescaled range statistic are
   used to test the null hypothesis. When the modified rescaled range,
   which accounts for short-term memory in a series is used, the null
   hypothesis is accepted for the monthly series. This in turn indicates
   little evidence of long-term memory in the series. An identical
   conclusion is also arrived at when a second null hypothesis that the
   series are independent is tested by using the modified rescaled range
   statistic. The main conclusion from the study is that there is little
   evidence of long-term memory in monthly hydrologic series. However, for
   annual series, the evidence for lack of long-term memory is
   inconclusive, Mainly because the number of observations is small and the
   power of the test based on modified rescaled range is low with small
   samples. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We study the effects of gravel mining on the aquifer-river system in the
   Baix Fluvia area (NE Spain). Field data show that instream mining has
   caused a decline of the water-table head of the unconfined aquifer along
   the Fluvia river. Further, dredging in its lowermost reaches reduces its
   stage and decreases its slope to zero, which facilitates mixing with
   sea-water, and thus salty-water intrusion from the river into the
   aquifer. A dimensionless solution of the Boussinesq's equation is
   derived to estimate the water-table shape and the amount of groundwater
   lost as runoff for any given decline of the river stage. A flow and
   solute transport finite-element model is also used to calculate
   groundwater loses for the Fluvia case. We find that results of the
   general analytical solution are consistent with those of the numerical
   model, which reproduces the actual layered aquifer and a more
   appropriate domain geometry. Finally, the observed chloride distribution
   and time evolution are broadly reproduced using the numerical model. It
   shows that significant chloride plumes develop after the cone of
   depression of the nearby wells reaches the river. However, a natural
   clean-up takes place in the absence of pumping when the natural water
   gradient turns completely towards the river. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method that allows the diurnal variation of
   ground heat flux to be computed from the corresponding time series
   measurement of surface soil temperature. Soil temperature and soil heat
   flux over time at one location are uniquely related through a half-order
   derivative/integral operator when heat transfer in a soil matrix is
   described by a one-dimensional diffusion equation with a constant
   diffusivity parameter. Both simulated and observed data have been used
   to test the method. The case study suggests that the derived
   relationships between soil heat flux and soil temperature under
   idealized conditions provide satisfactory approximations for practical
   purposes. Close agreement of the estimated variables with observations
   indicates chat this proposed method is promising. Its potential
   applications include the estimation of the regional energy balance at
   the land surface using remote sensing observations. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In many countries, the determination of the parameters of the wave,
   likely to be produced after the failure of a dam, is required by law,
   and systematic studies are mandatory. There is a necessity to develop
   adequate numerical solvers which are able to reproduce situations
   originated from the irregularities of a non-prismatic bed and to model
   the complete equations that progress despite the irregular character of
   the data. Many hydraulic situations can be described by means of a
   one-dimensional (1D) model, either because a more detailed resolution is
   unnecessary or because the flow is markedly ID. Many techniques have
   been developed recently for systems of conservation laws in 1D tin the
   context of gas dynamics). Some years after their adoption for solving
   problems in gas dynamics, upwind and total variation diminishing (TVD)
   numerical schemes have been successfully used for the solution of the
   shallow water equations, with similar advantages. Their use is
   nevertheless only gradually gaining acceptance in this sector. The
   performance of some of these techniques for practical applications in
   river flow is reported in this work. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{In an empirical/statistical approach, the relationship between watershed
   characteristics and the inter-lake variance of chemical lake water
   composition is analyzed. The lake water quality data sampled in 87
   extensively monitored glacial/boreal lakes is hence supplemented with
   digital landscape information covering the categories: geology, soils,
   land cover, and topography. With standard I : 50 000 scale maps as the
   source of information, 33 classes of landscape elements are identified
   and described with respect to morphological and hydrological
   characteristics. When regression models based on the combined
   morphology/ hydrology information are compared with models excluding the
   hydrology information, the hypothesis whether or not information
   regarding hydrological watershed characteristics improves the
   performance of existing models can be tested. It is concluded that the
   introduction of hydrological element descriptors significantly improves
   the overall performance of regression models describing the inter-lake
   variance of lake water: hardness, color, pH, total phosphorus
   concentration, alkalinity, conductivity, and Secchi depth. When these
   variables are ranked according to the amount of model performance
   achieved, the general importance of surface hydrology in the process of
   emitting and transporting associated substances through the landscape
   can be assessed. Out of the 33 landscape elements totally digitized, ten
   are identified as significantly correlated to the inter-lake variance of
   characterizing lake water quality. When they are ranked according to
   their influential power, the consequence of watershed interference can
   be qualitatively assessed. The results should be easily implemented in
   watershed management and because of the general validity given by the
   extensive empirical database - valid in many glacial/boreal watersheds
   throughout the world. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Month = {{MAR 8}},
Abstract = {{A variable-density groundwater model is used to analyse the effects of
   tidal fluctuations on sea-water intrusion in an unconfined aquifer. It
   is shown that the tidal activity forces the sea-water to intrude further
   inland and it also creates a thicker interface than would occur without
   tidal effects. Moreover, the configuration of the interface is radically
   changed when the tidal fluctuations are included. This is because of the
   dramatic changes in the flow pattern and velocity of the groundwater
   near the shoreline. For aquifer depths much larger than tidal
   amplitudes, the tidal fluctuation does not have much effect on how far
   the sea-water intrudes into the aquifer; nevertheless, a significant
   change in the configuration of concentration contours because of the
   effect of tidal fluctuations is observed. This change is more noticeable
   at the top of the aquifer, near the water table, than at the bottom of
   the aquifer, and is caused by the infiltration of salt water into the
   top of the aquifer at higher tidal levels. A flatter beach slope,
   therefore, intensifies this phenomenon. The interface configurations do
   not change noticeably over the course of a tidal cycle. Neglecting tidal
   fluctuation effects results in an inaccurate evaluation of the water
   table elevation at the land end of the aquifer, although no
   distinguishable difference is seen between the water tables near the
   shoreline. Where the landward boundary condition is a constant head, the
   effects of tidal fluctuations on sea-water intrusion are more pronounced
   than for cases where the landward boundary condition is a specified
   flux. Also it is shown that the effects of tidal fluctuations are more
   significant for a sloping beach than for a vertical shoreline and the
   salt water intrudes further inland for the sloping case. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{A rainfall-runoff model that can be successfully calibrated (i.e.,
   yielding sufficiently accurate results) using relatively short lengths
   of data, is desirable for any basin in general, and the basins of
   developing countries like India, in particular, for which scarcity of
   data is a major problem. An artificial neural network paradigm, known as
   the temporal back propagation neural network (TBP-NN), is successfully
   demonstrated as a monthly rainfall-runoff model. The performance of this
   model in a `'scarce data{''} scenario (i.e., the effects of using
   reduced calibration periods on the performance) is compared with
   Volterra-type Functional Series Models (FSM), utilising the data of the
   River Lee (in the UK) and the Thuthapuzha River tin Kerala, India). The
   results confirm the TBP-NN model as being the most efficient of the
   black-box models tested for calibration periods as short as six years.

Abstract = {{While pristine forests are traditionally regarded as environments with
   low runoff and low erosion potential, timber harvesting can dramatically
   affect surface runoff production, with some important consequences for
   in-stream water quality. A series of targe-scale (300 m(2)) rainfall
   simulator experiments on disturbed forest hillslopes, incorporating both
   snig track (skid trail) and general harvesting areas (GHA), examined
   runoff generation and redistribution during three sequential simulated
   storms on 13 sites. The simulated storms represented 30-min rainfall
   events with recurrence intervals of 2, 10, and 100 y respectively. The
   13 sites were selected to represent dominant soil types and ages since
   disturbance. The snig tracks and GHA an characterised by significantly
   different soil hydraulic and vegetation properties as reflected in the
   nature and magnitude of runoff production. Infiltration-excess runoff
   dominated the snig track areas, white on recently disturbed GHA, runoff
   was distinctly patchy because of the high degree of spatial variability
   in saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) and degrees of disturbance.
   Surface runoff from recently constructed snig tracks was an order of
   magnitude higher than the neighbouring GHA. Relative differences in
   runoff production between the two areas declined during extreme rainfall
   events. Infiltration tests also indicated that a change in the processes
   and rates of runoff persists for at least 5 y after disturbance. The
   practice of redistributing concentrated snig track runoff at cross banks
   wets most effective for small storms. However, during more extreme
   events, the volume of snig track runoff increased and Bow velocities and
   transport distances increased as the hillslope became increasingly
   saturated. The varying ability of the GHA to generate runoff and absorb
   concentrated how from the snig track is likely to be critical in
   predicting both the initial hydrologic response and the recovery of a
   small catchment from forest disturbance. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Numerical models of groundwater flow require hydraulic conductivity
   values for the gridblocks covering the flow domain. However, field
   conductivity data are usually measured at a different scale (usually
   smaller) than that of the gridblocks. The present paper describes an
   approach for upscaling to block-scale, which combines the rigorous
   result of small-value perturbation analysis with a plausible
   generalization of the first-order results to large variance.
   Steady-state flow through a block of stochastically heterogeneous
   medium, with constant values of the hydraulic head at the two opposite
   sides, is analysed. An upscaling rule and relationship is obtained
   between the local-scale hydraulic conductivity and the expected mean and
   variance of blockscale conductivity, where the block size is comparable
   with the correlation scale of the local conductivity held. The rather
   simple expressions that are obtained are validated using data from
   numerical experiments. Further, a generalized spatial power-averaging
   method to calculate the block-scale conductivity from values of
   local-scale conductivity is developed, in which the exponent value is
   given as a function of the ratios of how domain dimensions to the
   respective correlation length. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{An empirical equation for annual evaporation (E) of the form, E = P/\{1
   + (P/R-n)(alpha))(1/alpha), where P is the annual precipitation, R-n the
   water equivalent of annual net radiation, and cu an adjustable
   parameter, is evaluated using held observations (water balance, and
   micrometeorologic measurements for areas ca. 1 km(2)) at eight locations
   having different types of vegetation, and results from a biophysical
   process-based model for four years (1987-1990) for ten river basins
   (areas larger than 10(6) km(2)). For the field observations, minimum
   value of the mean absolute error (MAE) was 33 mm (4\% of the mean
   observed evaporation) obtained for alpha = 2.6, and the empirical
   equation was able to explain 99\% of the variance under linear least
   square regression, with a slope of 0.99, intercept of 16 mm, and
   standard error of estimate (SEE) of 46 mm. For evaporation from the
   river basins, minimum value of the MAE was 36 mm (5\% of the mean
   evaporation) obtained for alpha = 1.8, and the empirical equation was
   able to explain 97\% of the variance, with linear regression slope of
   1.01, intercept of - 11 mm, and SEE of 45 mm. The effect of spatial
   variations in P and R-n in determining evaporation from the empirical
   equation is analyzed to develop an understanding of the differences in
   the value of alpha for the held observations and the river basins. (C)

   used to simulate the runoff of seventy subcatchments in the Dongjiang,

Abstract = {{For many numerical modelling applications the problem of specifying an
   optimum mesh resolution remains unbounded and for mesh construction
   objective a priori rules do not exist. By contrast, the problem of
   specifying model parameter surfaces is largely bounded within known
   physical error distributions. In this paper we thus investigate the
   impact of varying mesh resolution on a typical non-linear finite
   numerical solver. Specifically, a two-dimensional finite element code
   which solves the Shallow Water equations was used to simulate unsteady
   flows in a meandering compound channel. A range of different mesh
   resolutions and parameter surfaces were simulated to determine relative
   dominance and, unlike previous studies, the effect on both bulk flow and
   distributed outputs were analysed. The results showed a wide variation
   in performance for mesh discretizations which fulfilled traditional
   length scale-based construction. Mesh resolution effects were at least
   as important as a typical calibration parameter and model response was
   shown to be highly complex. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   described which records event magnitudes but not their timing. A float

   intensity calibrated so that each rainless period generates a line on a
   protected film. Rainfall event magnitudes are recorded as the vertical
   intervals between consecutive horizontal lines on the film. That is, the
   record represents a stratigraphic column of rainfall events at the gauge
   location. A network of the gauges allows significant rainfall event
   ``layers{''} to be linked through space analogous to stratigraphic

Abstract = {{The variability of soil water content over short distances was studied
   at seven experimental fields, located in southern Sweden, eastern
   Germany, southern France, and in the Netherlands. The soils all in use
   as arable land, are a sandy soil, a stony sandy soil, a loamy sand, a
   sandy loam, and three clay soils. Samples with a volume of 100 cm(3)
   were taken at close intervals in trenches at several depths to determine
   potential water repellency and soil water content. When dry, the
   topsoils of the Mellby site in Sweden (loamy sand) and the Vredepeel
   site in the Netherlands (sandy soil) are water repellent, whereas the
   soils at the other five sites are wettable, according to the water drop
   penetration time (WDPT) test. The variation in water content within
   short distances was high at most depths at all sites, with differences
   of 7 to 18 vol\% within a horizontal distance of only centimeters to
   decimeters. Drier as well as wetter soil areas were visualized by
   contour plots of the soil water content distributions in the transects.
   Large differences in wetting capacity between samples taken in the
   topsoil and in the subsoil at several sites were assessed by
   measurements of the wetting rate. In many cases, subsoil samples wetted
   faster than topsoil samples. The severity of water repellency of sandy
   samples from the Vredepeel site increased remarkably at oven
   temperatures above 65 degrees C, The wetting rates of dried samples from
   this soil were also evidently influenced by the oven temperature;
   samples dried at 25 degrees C wetted immediately and reached soil water
   contents of 23 to 32 vol\% within one hour, whereas samples dried above
   85 degrees C hardly wetted during 72 hours, as a result of the increased
   water repellency at higher drying temperatures. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We characterized temporal and spatial variables describing hydraulic and
   solute transport in a heterogeneous soil. Under field conditions, bulk
   density, water content and concentration of three applied tracers
   (conservative Br-, nitrate NO3-, and a pesticide BENTAZON) were measured
   after destructive sampling and compared to continuous measurements. A
   comparison of destructive sampling and continuous measurements were used
   to investigate the held. Soil volumetric samples were obtained from
   trenches on a grid of 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.1 m in a fallow area of
   approximately 1300 m(2) to generate two dimensional (2D) interpolated
   maps. Bulk density, water content, and solute concentration data sets
   were evaluated by geostatistical analysis in order to choose the best
   method to build interpolations. Semivariogram analyses for volumetric
   water content (theta), bulk density (rho(d)) and solute concentrations
   (NO3- and BENTAZON) showed no autocorrelation possessing only a pure
   nugget effect. 2D interpolated maps of these soil parameters were
   constructed using the Radial Basis Function method that allowed
   calculation of vertical water content and solute concentration profiles
   and the associated mean (mu) and variance (sigma) distributions.
   Vertical neutron and TDR water content profiles were successfully
   simulated with a discrete geometry approach using the 2D interpolated
   maps. Destructive sampling for water content and continuous measurements
   using neutron and TDR probes, revealed consistent results. Comparison of
   solute concentration from destructive sampling and ceramic solution
   samplers is less satisfactory at this site owing to both the
   heterogeneity and the inadequacy of ceramic solution samplers to sample
   the total soil concentration. Finally, preferential flow pathways can be
   visualized on the 2D interpolated maps of the concentration of Br-,
   BENTAZON, and NO3-. The observed distribution of tracers provides clear
   evidence of the influence of both soil hydraulic properties and
   geochemical heterogeneities which must be incorporated to predict water
   and solute fluxes. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Spatio-temporal patterns of soil moisture status highly affect the
   heterogeneity of soil water and solute transport and leaching of
   chemicals to the groundwater. In order to quantify and describe spatial
   variability of ecologically highly relevant spatial and temporal
   processes Linked to soil moisture at the land surface, the
   spatio-temporal covariance structure and the reasons for its change in
   time need to be identified. Therefore, soil water pressure head was
   monitored in two surface horizons between April and November 1995 at two
   field sites with a shallow ground water table, a sandy loam and a heavy
   clay soil in north-east Germany. For the 10- and the 30-cm depth of the
   sandy loam soil and for the 30-cm depth of the heavy clay soil the
   variance of soil water pressure head h (on log basis) was large under
   wet conditions. With decreasing soil water pressure head the variance of
   log(10)(-h) decreased to a critical value, for which a spatial
   correlation structure disappeared. With further drying, the variance of
   log(10)(-h) increased again, and a spatial range of correlation existed.
   During drying, temporally stable variation patterns developed at both
   field sites. The change of variance of log,,( -h) which is probably
   associated with changing degree of heterogeneity of flow conditions
   validates the findings of Roth (1995) obtained from stochastic flow
   model calculations. In general, the temporal correlation length was
   better defined than that of spatial correlation. At both depths,
   correlation lengths of the sandy loam were larger than those of the
   heavy clay soil. Random spatial variation of log(10)(-h) occurred under
   conditions when the hydraulic gradient was close to zero. With our
   experimental design we could identify (i) temporal persistence of
   spatial patterns and correlation ranges of soil water status that can be
   used for representativity studies, (ii) the within-site variation of
   land surface moisture status, and (iii) a basis for description of
   spatial processes of effective soil properties that are Linked to soil
   water status at the land surface. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Multiple sampling is widely used in vadose zone percolation experiments
   to investigate the extent in which soil structure heterogeneities
   influence the spatial and temporal distributions of water and solutes.
   In this note, a simple, robust, mathematical model, based on the
   beta-statistical distribution, is proposed as a method of quantifying
   the magnitude of heterogeneity in such experiments. The model relies on
   fitting two parameters, alpha and zeta to the cumulative elution curves
   generated in multiple-sample percolation experiments. The model does not
   require knowledge of the soil structure. A homogeneous or uniform
   distribution of a solute and/or soil-water is indicated by alpha = zeta
   = 1, Using these parameters, a heterogeneity index (HI) is defined as
   root 3 times the ratio of the standard deviation and mean. Uniform or
   homogeneous flow of water or solutes is indicated by HI = 1 and
   heterogeneity is indicated by HI > 1. A large value for this index may
   indicate preferential flow. The heterogeneity index relies only on
   knowledge of the elution curves generated from multiple sample
   percolation experiments and is, therefore, easily calculated. The index
   may also be used to describe and compare the differences in solute and
   soil-water percolation from different experiments. The use of this index
   is discussed for several different leaching experiments. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Laboratory studies of solute transport in soils (soil columns) are not
   totally representative of field conditions (spatial variability, soil
   structure etc.). Field studies hardly allow quantification of fluxes and
   mechanisms. In this article, and intermediate approach is suggested,
   using a lysimeter (1.7 m(3)) of an almost undisturbed soil. with
   controlled boundary conditions, the aim being to be able to quantify
   fluxes and mechanisms at a scale closer to field conditions, thus
   yielding results that better depict reality. Two experiments, with
   constant water fluxes of 1.05 and 1.48 mm h(-1) were conducted. Solutes
   were introduced as concentration pulses. Species (H2O)-H-2, Cl- and Br-
   were used as tracers, and K+, NH4+, NO3-, atrazine as interactive and/or
   reactive solutes. Elution curves were analyzed by the method of moments.
   Results show that about 20\% of the water are immobile. As a consequence
   of anion exclusion, anion tracers appear at the outlet with an advance
   of about 10\% in time as compared to isotopic tracers. The added NH4+ is
   mostly nitrified, and K+ undergoes cation exchange with Ca2+ and Mg2+.
   Under our experimental conditions, leaching of atrazine is significant
   with low degradation. A third experiment was conducted, in which the
   flow was interrupted while the solute peak was within the lysimeter, and
   400 soil samples were extracted from the lysimeter. Soil-water content
   distributions exhibit coefficients of variation within layers between
   5\% and 27\%. Concentration distributions exhibit coefficients of
   variation within layers between 22\% and 59\%. There is no correlation
   between concentration and water content. The observed spatial
   variability suggests the occurrence of preferential flow. Concentrations
   in suction cups were 55\%-136\% of those measured in corresponding soil
   samples. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Modelling of solute transport in a large undisturbed lysimeter, during

Abstract = {{Transport models have often been tested in laboratory studies using soil
   columns, usually of the order of 1 dm(3) in size. Even if the columns
   are undisturbed, their small size does not allow water flow and solute
   transport to occur as they would in the field. We therefore used a 1.7
   m(3) column and applied steady-state flow rates of the order of 1 mm
   h(-1), and then applied pluses of tracers Br-, Cl- and (H2O)-H-2 and of
   atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-S-triazine) to the
   surface.
   Classical models for tracers with these boundary conditions are the
   Convection-Dispersion model (CD), the two-region (mobile-immobile water)
   model with first-order exchange of solutes (MIM), and the transfer
   function models, among which the most widely used is the Convective
   Lognormal Transfer Function model (CLT). Thanks to simple boundary and
   initial conditions, analytical solutions are available for all these
   models.
   The CD model (1 parameter) was not able to fit the tracer elution
   curves. but use of the MIM model was satisfactory. The CLT model and the
   CD model (2 parameters) also gave satisfactory fits. To choose the best
   model we used the parameters fitted to the elution curves to predict
   vertical concentration profiles in the lysimeter. These predictions are
   compared to the profile obtained after thorough sampling of the soil
   when tracers reached about half way down the lysimeter. The MIM model
   yielded a better prediction. However, accurate predictions would require
   taking into account the highly stratified characteristics of this soil.
   Atrazine simulation was done with the CD-based one-site kinetic sorption
   and first-order decay equation. Again analytical solutions are provided
   for our experimental conditions. Values of decay and absorption
   parameters are in agreement with previous studies. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A modified version of the FLOCR/ANIMO model combination was developed
   and tested on simulating solute transport through a cracked macroporous
   clay soil. The improved model combination was calibrated against
   measurements of groundwater level, soil moisture content, bromide
   concentrations in the groundwater, and bromide contents in the soil
   profile. The contribution of the modifications made to the model on the
   overall model combination's performance was analysed. Nitrate transport
   was simulated with minor model calibration. Within three weeks after
   bromide application at a wet soil surface without visible shrinkage
   cracks, high bromide concentrations in the groundwater were measured,
   showing clear evidence of preferential flow through permanent
   macropores. The modified model combination was able to adequately
   simulate the bromide concentrations in the groundwater and the bromide
   contents in the soil profile. The most important modifications made to
   the model combination which allowed for these results were the inclusion
   of permanent macropores and internal catchment domains in the model.
   Shrinkage cracks, interflow into macropores, and diffusive exchange
   between macropore water and soil water also contributed positively to
   the model combination's performance. The contribution of shrinkage
   cracks to transport of solutes applied under dry conditions could not be
   tested in this study because of the lack of relevant field-data. For
   complete testing of models like the FLOCR/ANIMO model combination, which
   include transport through permanent macropores and shrinkage cracks,
   results of tracer experiments executed under dry and wet conditions are
   required. The model combination's performance on simulating nitrate
   concentration in the groundwater was moderate. For a more accurate
   simulation of nitrate transport additional model adjustments need to be
   considered, especially concerning the oxygen diffusion through
   macropores. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of preferential
   finger flow on solute leaching to tile drains and shallow groundwater in
   a water repellent sandy soil. Measurements of site hydrology and bromide
   movement were made during a six-month period following application in
   autumn 1994 to a 900 m(2) plot. A dye tracing study was also conducted
   and this confirmed the presence of finger flow in the water repellent
   topsoil. Water Bow and bromide transport was simulated using a
   mobile-immobile concept, in which a fraction of the soil volume is
   assumed not to participate in transport. With calibration of `difficult'
   parameters (e.g. the fractional mobile volume), and accounting for
   significant water inflows to the plot from the surroundings, there was a
   good agreement between simulated and observed hydrology and solute
   transport patterns at the site. Mass balance calculations showed that
   ca. 46\% of the bromide application was lost to the tile drains in the
   winter period following application, while 16\% was lost in shallow
   lateral groundwater flow. Comparisons between one- and two-domain
   simulations showed that preferential flow reduced soil water contents
   and increased drainflow in the early autumn, leading to a more rapid
   bromide transport to depth. Nevertheless, the impact of preferential
   finger flow on leaching was minor for the non-reactive tracer bromide in
   this experiment, presumably because it was applied to relatively wet
   soil. However, scenario simulations for autumn application of a short
   half-life pesticide showed more significant effects, with leaching
   increased by ca. 80\% because of preferential flow (from 1.2\% to 2.2\%
   of the applied amount). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Preferential soil water movement was simulated using a modified version
   of the MACRO model. The study contributes to the analysis of the held
   water regime and the solute balance of two tile-drained no-till
   agricultural soils influenced by shallow groundwater tables. Previously
   measured soil matric potentials and groundwater levels as well as
   Bromide and dye tracer experiments indicated that flow and transport
   along preferential pathways might be quantitatively important at the
   heavy clay as well as at the sandy loam site. The objective of this
   study was to optimally describe the field measured matric potentials and
   groundwater level fluctuations by using a one- and a two-domain version
   of the MACRO model and by model calibration using available data. The
   original MACRO model was modified with respect to simulating effects of
   groundwater table fluctuations and tile drains in the one-dimensional
   flow model by including a sink term, based on the potential theory and
   an empirical approach, that approximately relates the local to the held
   water regime. We use an implicit finite difference discretization
   together with a Newton-Raphson iterative scheme for the numerical
   solution of the model. The coupled matrix and macropore flow equations
   are solved sequentially. Model parameters were calibrated using
   laboratory-measured soil hydraulic parameters and field-measured time
   series of matric potentials and water tables. Comparisons between the
   measured and simulated water table fluctuations indicate that the
   consideration of preferential flow in macropores improves the
   one-dimensional description of the water regime of the aggregated clayey
   soil. For the sandy loam soil, neither the modified MACRO nor a
   one-domain model could explain observed preferential flow patterns. The
   failure at the sandy loam site may possibly be caused by periodically
   occurring hydrophobic conditions at the soil surface or by the existence
   of fissures in a relatively low permeable subsoil horizon, effects which
   could not be considered in the model. Hydraulic parameters of the soil
   matrix and macropore system could satisfactorily be calibrated. However,
   the parameters of the exchange term describing water transfer between
   the inter- and intraaggregate pore system could not be clearly
   identified using the available field data. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A one-year field-scale leaching experiment was conducted on a structured
   clay soil for the purpose of evaluating the
   dual-porosity/dual-permeability model MACRO. The model was first
   calibrated against measurements of water contents, drainflow, and
   bromide contents in the soil profile and concentrations in drain
   discharge. Bentazone transport was then simulated without any further
   model calibration. The model gave acceptable predictions of the water
   balance, providing the significant water inflow into the plot from the
   surrounding areas was accounted for. Simulated bromide contents in the
   soil were, for the most part, within one standard deviation of the
   measured values. Bromide was measured in tile drainage 26 days after
   spraying at concentrations > 3 mg l(-1) (after 43 mm of precipitation),
   while groundwater concentrations at 2 m depth were as large as 10 mg
   l(-1) only 42 days after spraying. This is a strong indication of
   macropore flow. The agreement between model predictions and bentazone
   measurements was on the whole good, especially for the depth profiles
   and the initial breakthrough in the drainflow, whereas short-term
   fluctuations in drainage water concentrations were poorly captured. This
   was probably caused by the model description of first-order
   mass-exchange between micro- and macropores, which neglects lateral
   concentration gradients. Judging from statistical criteria, the model
   accurately predicted bentazone amounts in the soil profile (model
   efficiency 0.87), while 66\% and 89\% of the simulated bentazone
   concentrations in tile drainage were within a factor of 2 and 5 of
   measured values respectively. Simulations run without macropore flow
   overestimated bentazone leaching by ca. 20\%. In other words, macropore
   flow reduced leaching in this clay soil, because much of the bentazone
   was `protected' against bypass flow in macropores, being stored in
   micropore water moving at a `reduced' convective transport velocity. (C)

Abstract = {{Water repellent soils are known to inhibit water infiltration ultimately
   forcing water to flow via preferential paths through the vadose zone. To
   study water flow and transport in a water repellent sandy soil, a
   bromide tracer experiment was carried out, which started in the fall,
   after winter wheat had been sown. Field average soil water content and
   bromide profiles were determined seven times during a 474 d period. A
   one-dimensional convection-dispersion model was used to simulate
   observed flow and transport. It was found that water content and bromide
   profiles could be successfully simulated. The main reason was that
   despite water repellency no distinct preferential flow occurred within
   this particular experimental field. Only wavy wetting fronts were
   observed. This was probably due to a uniform vegetation cover and a
   relatively thick A-horizon (30 cm), which contrasts with known water
   repellent sandy soils with thin (10 cm) top layers in which typical
   fingered flow patterns had previously been found. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A bromide tracer was applied on a 2.2 m long and 0.4 m wide plot at the
   location of a hydrophobic soil in the southwest of The Netherlands. At
   the end of the experiment, the plot was excavated to a depth of 0.7 m
   using 100 cm(3) samples, yielding a total of 1680 samples to quantify
   the three-dimensional spatial distribution of water content, pH, bromide
   concentration and degree of water repellency. Measured water content and
   solute distributions indicated that unstable (fingered) how prevails. It
   is considered that contaminant transport under such conditions can
   proceed at rates that are higher than that which would normally occur if
   the flow were stable. This article illustrates an attempt at modeling
   contaminant transport under unstable flow conditions using measurements
   obtained from the experimental plot. A finite element solution of the
   two-dimensional Richards equation forms the basis for the unstable flow
   simulation, while a particle tracking random walk solution of the
   two-dimensional convection-dispersion equation forms the basis of the
   transport simulation. The water flow simulation and the solute transport
   simulation were compared with the measured data, Initial results
   indicate that model predictions compared fairly well with measured water
   content and solute transport data. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{One mechanism for the initiation of unstable flow in porous media is a
   condition of hydrophobicity of the solid phase. Recent continuous and
   nondestructive measurements of water content distribution in a 200 cm
   wide by 70 cm deep trench of a Netherlands' field soil containing a
   hydrophobic layer, reveals a complicated wetting pattern with fingered
   flow being quite prevalent. The soil profile consists of a humic top
   layer, a second layer consisting of hydrophobic sand, and a hydrophilic
   sandy layer at the bottom of the soil profile. In this paper we show our
   attempts to simulate the unstable flow pattern observed in the field
   using a numerical solution developed for modeling gravity-driven
   unstable flow. The unstable how simulation method employs a globally
   mass conservative finite element solution of the Richards equation
   applied to the soil trench. The overall patterns of simulated saturation
   are similar to those of observed saturation. Statistical analysis shows
   that pointwise predicted saturation is reasonably close to the observed.

Abstract = {{Understanding the influence of irrigation methods on solute transport is
   essential to properly manage chemical use in agricultural soils. In this
   study, we compare the transport of a conservative solute (bromide) under
   sprinkler and flood irrigations on a sandy clay loam (mixed Ustollic
   Haplargid) under no-till condition. After spraying 148.8 kg/ha of KBr on
   the surface, approximate to 25 cm of irrigation water was applied in six
   increments over two months as flood irrigation on one plot and as
   sprinkler irrigation on another plot. The net applied water (NAW =
   irrigation + precipitation - evaporation) was similar for both plots,
   which allowed the comparison of the Br profiles for the two types of
   irrigation. Water content and Br concentration were sampled at 5, 19,
   34, and 68 days after chemical application.
   The recovered mass of Br and the location of center of mass were
   comparable for the two types of irrigation. The spread around the center
   of mass, however, was higher for the flood-irrigated plot. On the
   flood-irrigated plot, more mass leached below the depth of 90 cm, with
   the differences being statistically significant. The velocity of the Br
   center of mass was consistently 10\%-20\% larger than the piston
   displacement velocity. Dispersion and velocity coefficients varied
   substantially between sampling time. A recent quasi-steady solution of
   the convection-dispersion equation {[}M.H. Nachabe, L.R. Ahuja,

Title = {{delta D and delta O-18 evidence for inputs to groundwater at a wetland

Abstract = {{The stable isotope compositions (delta(18)O and delta D) of water have
   been used to determine the relative contributions of different water
   sources to the groundwater in a barrier sand-bar that separates a
   coastal freshwater marsh from Lake Erie, Canada. An extensive
   groundwater study was initiated by Environment Canada at Point Pelee
   National Park after elevated nutrient concentrations were measured in
   the park's marsh, located on a spit of land that extends 15 km south
   into Lake Erie. As part of this larger study, which includes groundwater
   and nutrient modelling, the stable isotope compositions (delta(18)O and
   delta D) of water have been used to independently determine the nature
   and extent of groundwater flow within sand deposits that separate the
   marsh from Lake Erie, One of the two study sites chosen for this
   investigation is located near a large septic-system tile-bed that
   receives human waste from a public toilet facility within the park, and
   could potentially release nutrients to the marsh via the groundwater.
   Both transects studied are well suited to isotopic investigation because
   they an located between two potentially recharging surface water bodies
   with temporally variable isotopic compositions, and because the
   transects are subject to recharge by local precipitation, which exhibits
   large seasonal isotopic variations. These differing isotopic
   compositions, when considered spatially and temporally, make it possible
   to establish the source and movement of groundwater within the
   transects. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of surface
   waters from the Point Pelee marsh and Lake Erie lie on an evaporation
   line with a slope of 5.7. The isotopic composition of Lake Erie remained
   relatively stable for over 21 months (delta(18)O = -7.5 parts per
   thousand to -6.7 parts per thousand) whereas the marsh exhibited
   considerable spatial and temporal variability (delta(18)O = -8.4 parts
   per thousand to -0.1 parts per thousand). The delta D and delta(18)O
   values of precipitation samples vary seasonally with local surface
   temperatures, and constitute a local meteoric water line of delta D =
   8.0(delta(18)O) + 9.8. While influx of precipitation is evident and
   similar in the upper two metres of both transects, the relative
   contribution to groundwater from Lake Erie and the Point Pelee marsh
   appears to differ. The average delta(18)O and delta D groundwater values
   measured for the narrower transect were -7.0 parts per thousand and -54
   parts per thousand respectively, and reflect significant groundwater
   recharge from both Lake Erie (similar to 67\%) and the marsh (similar to
   28\%), Precipitation constitutes the primary source of groundwater
   recharge to the wider transect, located near the large septic-system
   tile-bed, with average groundwater values of delta(18)O = -9.1 parts per
   thousand and delta D = -65 parts per thousand. The isotopic profile of
   groundwater in this area is very stable, both with depth and over time,
   and contrasts sharply with the narrower northern transect which is much
   more dynamic.
   These findings suggest that the septic-system tile-bed is well situated
   in the wider portion of the barrier sand-bar, where a larger head
   difference between the lake and the marsh would be required to produce
   groundwater flow equivalent to that observed in the narrower transect.
   The differences in groundwater recharge between the two sites arise
   primarily from the difference in width, and account for the 2 parts per
   thousand and 10 parts per thousand differences in delta(18)O and delta D
   values, respectively, measured in the base-flow groundwater of the two
   transects. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The research described in this article investigates the utility of
   Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for short term forecasting of
   streamflow. The work explores the capabilities of ANNs and compares the
   performance of this tool to conventional approaches used to forecast
   streamflow. Several issues associated with the use of an ANN are
   examined including the type of input data and the number, and the size
   of hidden layer(s) to be included in the network. perceived strengths of
   ANNs are the capability for representing complex, non-linear
   relationships as well as being able to model interaction effects, The
   application of the ANN approach is to a portion of the Winnipeg River
   system in Northwest Ontario, Canada. Forecasting was conducted on a
   catchment area of approximately 20000 km(2) . using quarter monthly rime
   intervals. The results were most promising. A very close fit was
   obtained during the calibration (training) phase and the ANNs developed
   consistently outperformed a conventional model during the verification
   (testing) phase for all of the four forecast lead-times. The average
   improvement in the root mean squared error (RMSE) for the 8 years of
   test data varied from 5 ems in the four time step ahead forecasts to
   12.1 ems in the two rime step ahead forecasts. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Transient groundwater fluxes, as calculated by a groundwater flow model
   (MODFLOW) are used as input into a compartmental mixing-cell (CMC) model
   to simulate the transport of hydrochemical and isotopic species in
   regional groundwater systems. Good agreement between modeled and
   measured concentrations of solutes in groundwater provides greater
   confidence in estimating aquifer parameters for the flow model. The CMC
   model is currently developed fur multi-layered groundwater systems and
   allows for both recharge to the uppermost aquifer and upward or downward
   leakage between individual aquifers. The combination of the CMC approach
   and MODFLOW allows chemical and hydraulic data to be analysed
   simultaneously to allow for improved conceptualization of the
   groundwater system. The use of transient fluxes reflects the temporal
   scale and variability of the chemical tracers as well as the temporal
   variability of hydraulic conditions. The model is applied to a transect
   in the Gambler Embayment of the Otway Basin in South Australia to
   quantify mixing between two main aquifer systems. This groundwater
   system is hydraulically connected to the ocean in the west and as a
   result would have been affected by sea level changes over the last 30000
   yr. Radiocarbon simulations helped to quantify a major zone of downward
   leakage to the confined aquifer, with modeled rates of leakage ranging
   2-9 mm/yr. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Modelling data that correspond to rainfall accumulated over fixed
   periods of rime presents the challenging problem of dealing with a
   random variable that has a point mass at zero which corresponds to dry
   periods that occur with positive probability. One way to overcome this
   difficulty is to assume that the data correspond to a normal variate w,
   that has been truncated and transformed. The dry periods correspond to
   the (unobserved) negative values and the wet periods correspond to some
   power of the positive ones. The serial structure that is present in
   rainfall can be modelled by imposing a serial structure to w. We use a
   dynamic linear model on w using a Fourier representation to allow for
   the seasonality of the data, which in the case of tropical rainfall is
   very marked. The model is fitted using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method
   that uses latent variables to handle both dry periods and missing
   values. We use the model to estimate and predict both the amount of
   rainfall and the probability of a dry period. The method is illustrated
   with data collected in the Venezuelan state of Guarico. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Four time series were taken from three catchments in the North and South
   of England. The sites chosen included two in predominantly agricultural
   catchments, one at the tidal limit and one downstream of a sewage
   treatment works. A time series model was constructed for each of these
   series as a means of decomposing the elements controlling river water
   nitrate concentrations and to assess whether this approach could provide
   a simple management tool for protecting water abstractions.
   Autoregressive (AR) modelling of the detrended and deseasoned time
   series showed a `'memory effect''. This memory effect expressed itself
   as an increase in the winter-summer difference in nitrate levels that
   was dependent upon the nitrate concentration 12 or 6 months previously.
   Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) modelling showed that one of the
   series contained seasonal, non-stationary elements that appeared as an
   increasing trend in the winter-summer difference. The ARMA model was
   used to predict nitrate levels and predictions were tested against data
   held back from the model construction process - predictions gave average
   percentage errors of less than 10\%. Empirical modelling can therefore
   provide a simple, efficient method for constructing management models
   for downstream water abstraction. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The aim of the work was to quantify the role of runoff in nematode
   transport, compared with soil particle transport, during the rainy
   season in the Sudano-Sahelian area. The measurements were made at the
   outlet of a 58 ha watershed located in the Nioro du Rip region, south of
   the Senegalese peanut-growing basin. Every time the rainfall was
   sufficiently strong to cause a runoff, water was collected to estimate
   the volume of runoff, the soil particles and the nematode contents.
   Soils in the different agronomic areas were also collected to determine
   the nematode infestation. Some 6000 m(3) of water run off during the
   rainy season, together with 18.6 t of soil and 279.5 million of
   nematodes, 127 million of which were major phytoparasitic species. The
   transport of the different species was not uniform. The first five
   runoff episodes supplied one-half the volume of runoff water and
   transported approximately half the phytoparasitic nematodes, but nearly
   three-quarters of the solid particles. Fifteen percent of the nematodes
   were transported during the intermediate stage of the rainy season. and
   approximately 30\% during the final period, with equivalent water
   proportions but smaller quantities of soil. Of the 15 genera and species
   observed in the area, Tylenchorhynchus gladiolatus, Scutellonema
   cavenessi, Helicotylenchus dihystera and Gracilacus parvula represented
   87\% of the soil population, 61\% being accounted fur by the first two
   species. The average proportions of T. gladiolatus or G. parvula in the
   runoff water were greater than those in the soil, while the opposite was
   true for S. cavenessi, P. pseudopratensis and T. mashhoodi. H. dihystera
   was equally represented in both the soil and runoff water. The
   consequences of this ``biological erosion'' on the field infestation and
   on the cultural system based on fallowing are discussed. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{During the growing season of 1995, canopy water fluxes were measured
   within a northern hardwood stand in southern Ontario, Canada. Observed
   canopy interception loss, throughfall, and stemflow fluxes from the
   stand were 19.3+/-3.5\%, 76.4+/-2.9\%, and 4.3+/-2.0\% of incident
   precipitation, respectively. Both the original and revised Gash
   analytical rainfall interception loss models simulated these fluxes
   within the standard error of the observed estimates, suggesting that the
   analytical model may be appropriate for further applications within this
   forest type. The revised Gash model is recommended for further
   applications as it is better physically based. Both the original and
   revised models suggest that similar to 60\% of interception loss during
   the study period was evaporation from the canopy once rainfall has
   ceased while evaporation from the saturated canopy during rainfall
   accounted for similar to 27\%-33\% of interception loss. Additional
   components of interception (e.g., evaporation from trunks) were computed
   to be minor contributors to total canopy interception loss. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The performance of vegetative filter strips is governed by complex
   mechanisms. Models can help simulate the field conditions and predict
   the buffer effectiveness. A single event model for simulating the
   hydrology and sediment filtration in buffer strips is developed and
   field tested. Input parameters, sensitivity analysis, calibration and
   field testing of the model are presented, The model was developed by
   linking three submodels to describe the principal mechanisms found in
   natural buffers: a Petrov-Galerkin finite element kinematic wave
   overland flow submodel, a modified Green-Ampt infiltration submodel and
   the University of Kentucky sediment filtration model for grass areas.
   The new formulation effectively handles complex sets of inputs similar
   to those found in natural events. Major outputs of the model are water
   outflow and sediment trapping on the strip. The strength of the model is
   a good description of the hydrology within the filter area, which is
   essential for achieving good sediment outflow predictions or trapping
   efficiency. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the most sensitive
   parameters for the hydrology component are initial soil water content
   and vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity, and sediment
   characteristics (particle size, fall velocity and sediment density) and
   grass spacing for the sediment component. A set of 27 natural runoff
   events (rainfall amounts from 0.003 to 0.03 m) from a North Carolina
   Piedmont site was used to test the hydrology component, and a subset of
   nine events for the sediment component. Good predictions are obtained
   with the model if shallow uniform sheet flow (no channelization) occurs
   within the filter. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Forest drainage is recognized as a means of improving soil conditions
   for tree growth, but it may also have environmental impacts. This
   article presents the 5-y time trend of soil and surface water quality
   observed in a drainage experiment conducted in a black spruce (Picea
   mariana (Mill.) BSP) peatland of eastern Quebec, Canada, using the
   paired watershed approach. Nutrient content of peat soil water was
   enhanced by drainage. The effect was generally proportional to ditch
   closeness for S and Mg, while increases of N, Na, K and Ca were mainly
   observed within 5 m of the ditches, even though high levels of K and Ca
   were occasionally observed at 15-m distance. Drainage increased and
   sustained summer low flows by 25\% through a 80 m(3) d(-1) increase of
   base flow on the 8 ha basin. The concentration of suspended sediments
   significantly increased and exceeded acceptable limits For aquatic
   organisms only during ditching and during the peak Rows of the following
   weeks. No effect on suspended sediments was detected during the spring
   following ditching but an increase was observed during a storm 2 y after
   ditching. Drainage modified the basin outflow temperature fluctuations
   by lowering the average weekly minimum and increasing the maximum, by 2
   degrees C and 7 degrees C, respectively. Water temperature increases to
   25 degrees C or more at the outlet of the drained basin were above the
   preferred range for brook trout. The treatment significantly increased
   specific conductivity of surface water, which was clearly related to
   increases in mineral N (NH4 + NOx), Ca, Mg, Na and S concentrations.
   However, conductivity and the increased nutrient concentrations remained
   within the acceptable criteria for aquatic organisms. Drainage also
   produced a pH increase of one unit, a result attributed to increased
   runoff from the upland part of the treated watershed. No effect related
   to drainage was found for Zn, Fe and Al contents. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A general 2-D finite element multi-component reactive transport code,
   TRANQUI, was developed, using a sequential iteration approach (SIA). It
   is well suited to deal with complex real-world thermo-hydro-geochemical
   problems for single-phase variably water saturated porous media flow
   systems. The model considers a wide range of hydrological and
   thermodynamic as well as chemical processes such as aqueous
   complexation, acid-base, redox, mineral dissolution/precipitation, gas
   dissolution/ex-solution, ion exchange and adsorption via surface
   complexation. Under unsaturated conditions only water flow is
   considered, although gas pressures are allowed to vary in space in a
   depth-dependent manner specified by the user. In addition to the fully
   iterative sequential approach (SIA), a sequential non-iterative approach
   (SNIA), in which transport and chemistry are de-coupled, was implemented
   and tested. The accuracy and numerical performance of SIA and SNIA have
   been compared using several test cases. The accuracy of SNIA depends on
   space and time discretization as well as on the nature of the chemical
   reactions. The capability of the code to model a real case study in the
   field is illustrated by its application to the modeling of the
   hydrochemical evolution of the Llobregat Delta aquitard in northeastern
   Spain over the last 3500 years during when fresh-water flow from a lower
   aquifer displaced the native saline aquitard waters. Manzano and
   Custodio carried out a reactive transport model of this case study by
   using the PHREEQM code and considering: water flow, aqueous
   complexation, cation exchange and calcite dissolution. Their results
   compare favorably well with measured porewater chemical data, except for
   some of the cations. Our code is not only able to reproduce the results
   of previous numerical models, but leads to computed concentrations which
   are closer to measured data mainly because our model takes into
   consideration redox processes in addition to the processes mentioned
   above. A number of sensitivity runs were performed with TRANQUI in order
   to analyze the effect of errors and uncertainties on cation
   selectivities. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   mineralogy, and particle size distribution. Peak concentrations of
   suspended sediment coincided with changes in aqueous chemistry
   indicating arrival of surface water, suggesting that much of the
   discharging sediment had an allochthonous origin. Concentrations of
   suspended sediment peaked 14-16 h after rainfall, and the bulk of the
   sediment (approximately 1 metric ton in response to each storm)
   discharged within 24 h after rainfall. Filtered material included
   brightly colored fibers and organic matter. Suspended sediments
   consisted of dolomite, calcite, quartz, and clay. Proportions of each
   mineral constituent changed as the aquifer response to the storm
   progressed, indicating varying input from different sediment sources.
   The hydraulic response of the aquifer to precipitation was well
   described by changes in parameters obtained from the particle size
   distribution function, and corresponded to changes seen in TSS and
   mineralogy. Differences between storms in the quantity and mineralogy of
   sediment transported suggest that seasonal effects on surface sediment
   supply may be important. The quantity of sediment discharging and its
   potential to sorb and transport contaminants indicates that a mobile
   solid phase should be included in contaminant monitoring and contaminant
   transport models of karst. Temporal changes in sediment quantity and
   characteristics and differences between responses to the two storms,
   however, demonstrate that the process is not easily generalized. (C)

Abstract = {{The objective of this article is to develop and implement a
   comprehensive computer model that is capable of simulating the
   surface-water, ground-water, and stream-aquifer interactions on a
   continuous basis for the Rattlesnake Creek basin in southcentral Kansas,
   The model is to be used as a tool for evaluating long-term
   water-management strategies. The agriculturally-based watershed model
   SWAT and the ground-water model MODFLOW with stream-aquifer interaction
   routines, suitably modified, were linked into a comprehensive basin
   model known as SWATMOD. The hydrologic response unit concept was
   implemented to overcome the quasi-lumped nature of SWAT and represent
   the heterogeneity within each subbasin of the basin model. A graphical
   user-interface and a decision support system were also developed to
   evaluate scenarios involving manipulation of water rights and
   agricultural land uses on stream-aquifer system response. An extensive
   sensitivity analysis on model parameters was conducted, and model
   limitations and parameter uncertainties were emphasized. A combination
   of trial-and-error and inverse modeling techniques were employed to
   calibrate the model against multiple calibration targets of measured
   ground-water levels, streamflows, and reported irrigation amounts, The
   split-sample technique was employed for corroborating the calibrated
   model. The model was run for a 40 y historical simulation period, and a
   40 y prediction period. A number of hypothetical management scenarios
   involving reductions and variations in withdrawal rates and patterns
   were simulated. The SWATMOD model was developed as a hydrologically
   rational low-flow model for analyzing, in a user-friendly manner, the
   conditions in the basin when then is a shortage of water. (C) 1999

Title = {{Biospheric aspects of the hydrological cycle - Preface}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Core Project Biospheric Aspects of the Hydrological Cycle (BAHC) of
   the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP) addresses the
   biospheric aspects of the hydrological cycle through experiments and
   modelling of energy, water, carbon dioxide and sediment fluxes in the
   soil-vegetation-atmosphere system at a variety of spatial and temporal
   scales. Active regulation of water, energy and carbon dioxide fluxes by
   the vegetation make it an important factor in regulating the Earth's
   hydrological cycle and in the formation of the climate. Consequently,
   human induced conversion of vegetation cover is an important driver for
   climate change.
   A number of recent studies, discussed in this paper, emphasise the
   importance of the terrestrial biosphere for the climate system.
   Initially, these studies demonstrate the influence of the land surface
   on tropical weather and climate, revealing the mechanisms, acting at
   various scales, that connect increasing temperatures and decreasing
   rainfall to large-scale deforestation and other forms of land
   degradation. More recently, the significance of the land surface
   processes for water cycle and for weather and climate in temperate and
   boreal zones was demonstrated.
   In addition the terrestrial biosphere plays a significant role in the
   carbon dioxide fluxes and in global carbon balance. Recent work suggests
   that many ecosystems both in the tropics and in temperate zones may act
   as a substantial sink for carbon dioxide, though the temporal
   variability of this sink strength is yet unclear. Further, carbon
   dioxide uptake and evaporation by vegetation are intrinsically coupled
   leading to Links and feedbacks between land surface and climate that are
   hardly explored yet.
   Earth's vegetation cover and its changes owing to human impact have a
   profound influence on a lateral redistribution of water and transported
   constituents, such as nutrients and sediments, and acts therefore as an
   important moderator of Earth's biogeochemical cycles. In the BAHC
   science programme, the importance of studying the influence of climate
   and human activities on mobilisation and river-borne transport of
   constituents is explicitly articulated. The terrestrial water and
   associated material cycles are studied as highly dynamic in space and
   time, and reflect a complex interplay among climatic forcing,
   topography, land cover and vegetation dynamics.
   Despite a large progress in our understanding of how the terrestrial
   biosphere interacts with Earth's and climate system and with the
   terrestrial part of its hydrological cycle, a number of basic issues
   still remain unresolved. Limited to the scope of BAHC, the paper briefly
   assesses the present status and identifies the most important
   outstanding issues, which require further research. Two, arguably most
   important outstanding issues are identified: a limited understanding of
   natural variability, especially with respect to seasonal to inter-annual
   cycles, and of a complex ecosystem behaviour resulting from multiple
   feedbacks and multiple coupled biogeochemical cycles within the overall
   climate system. This leads to two major challenges for the future
   science agenda related to global change research. First, there is a need
   for a strong multidisciplinary integration of research efforts in both
   modelling and experiments, the latter extending to inter-annual
   timescales. Second, the ever increasing complexity in characterisation
   and modelling of the climate system, which is mainly owing to
   incorporation of the biosphere's and human feedbacks, may call for a new
   approach in global change impact studies. Methodologies need to be
   developed to identify risks to, and vulnerability of environmental
   systems, taking into account all important interactions between
   atmospheric, ecological and hydrological processes at relevant scales.
   With respect to the influence of climate and human activities on
   mobilisation and river-borne transport of constituents, the main issues
   for the future are related to declining availability and quality of
   ground data for quantity and quality of water discharge.
   Such assessments presented in this paper, in combination with community
   wide science evaluation, has lead to an update of the science agenda for
   BAHC, a summary of which is provided in the appendix. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Intercepted rainfall may be evaporated during or after the rain event.
   Intercepted rain is generally determined as the difference between
   rainfall measurements outside and inside the forest. Such measurements
   are often used to discriminate between water storage and evaporation
   during rain as well. Two well-accepted methods underestimate water
   storage by a factor two as compared to direct observations. The
   underestimation of storage is compensated by an overestimation of
   evaporation during rain by a factor of three. The direct observations of
   water storage and evaporation appear to agree with previous direct
   observations. Thus, it is concluded that these observations are
   representative Also, our results based on methods using only rainfall
   measurements inside and outside the forest appear to agree with previous
   results, This would result in the conclusion that the common methods
   systematically underestimate water storage and overestimate evaporation
   during rain. Indeed, the systematic errors can be explained by the
   neglect of drainage before saturation. Water storage is better simulated
   assuming an exponential saturation of a larger storage capacity. A
   smaller evaporation can be simulated using an appropriate resistance to
   vapour transport. The observations in dense coniferous forest showed
   water storage to be the dominant process in rainfall interception, but
   this conclusion should not be generalized to other forests and climates.
   Direct observations of water storage and evaporation are recommended to
   build a realistic set of parameters for rainfall interception studies of
   the main vegetation types. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Within the framework of the Northern Hemisphere Climate processes
   Land-surface Experiment (NOPEX) a field experiment was conducted in
   May-June 1994 focusing on carbon dioxide exchange over agricultural land
   within the boreal zone. The carbon dioxide flux was monitored
   continuously above spring barley and spring wheat crops. These
   measurements were supplemented by analysis of carbon dioxide fluxes at
   the leaf level. At the same time, canopy development, the capture of
   photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and atmospheric fluxes of heat
   and water vapour, were also monitored. The carbon dioxide fluxes on both
   leaf and canopy levels are presented in this paper. The relationship
   between the canopy carbon dioxide flux and absorbed photosynthetically
   active radiation (APAR) was found to be approximately linear over the
   full range of APAR, giving a quantum yield of 0.025 and 0.027 mol CO2
   per mol APAR for wheat and barley, respectively. In scaling the fluxes
   from leaf to canopy level two approaches are examined. Both are based on
   the ``big leaf{''} concept, using the light response of photosynthesis
   and the absorbed PAR. By comparing to the measured canopy fluxes it is
   found that the best agreement is obtained by scaling the light response
   of photosynthesis of the leaves to the canopy using absorbed PAR
   directly. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The ecosystem process model, FOREST-BGC, was applied on a stand in the
   NOPEX region in central Sweden. It was compared with measured data of
   net ecosystem carbon flux (F-n) and transpiration (E-Q) on a daily
   basis. Using the parameterized model, yearly budgets of carbon and water
   were constructed. F-n was obtained from eddy correlation measurements on
   a tower at heights of 35 and 100 m. E-Q was obtained from sap how
   measurements using a heat balance method. The model predictions were
   generally good, considering the relatively low requirements for input
   parameters. The explained variability of E-Q was high (95\%),
   particularly relative to the presence of large water deficit conditions
   on the site. The explained variability of F-n, was lower: it was 50\%
   and 66\% when compared to the measurements at 35 and 100 m,
   respectively. These results reflect the large spatial variability of F-n
   and the quantitative differences of measured F-n at the two heights over
   a patchy forest consisting of small stands of different age, density and
   pine/spruce composition (the validation was made prior to a detailed
   footprint analysis). The model performed differently for various periods
   during a year, which demonstrates the value of long-term measurements
   for model validations. The simulated yearly net carbon ecosystem uptake
   for the 50-year-old stand with a high leaf area index was 1.99 t ha(-1),
   with a range of 0.55-2.04 t ha(-1) for leaf area index of 3-6 observed
   at the NOPEX site. The model analysis of controls for mass fluxes showed
   that soil water shortage was the main limiting factor on the NOPEX site
   in the year studied. The comparative model run for the northern BOREAS
   site in central Canada indicated that a high atmospheric drought and
   plant resistance to water how frequently limited fluxes there. A more
   maritime climate of NOPEX site permits a larger gross production;
   however, larger respiration and decomposition rates reduce the
   quantitative differences of net ecosystem carbon uptake relative to the
   BOREAS site with a continental climate. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Land surface schemes are vital components of general circulation models
   (GCMs) which provide the fluxes of heat, water and momentum at the
   land-atmosphere interface. The fluxes simulated by these schemes are
   especially dependent on the way in which the canopy (or `bulk stomatal')
   conductance for plant transpiration is modelled. Considerable research
   has been carried out into the dependences of canopy conductance on the
   local environment, and empirical relationships for such dependences have
   been obtained by fitting the data collected in field and laboratory
   experiments. However, observed leaf level relationships between stomatal
   conductance and net photosynthesis suggest an alternative approach.
   Given an appropriate algorithm for scaling these values up to canopy
   level, such relationships allow canopy conductance values to be derived
   from (comparatively) well validated models of leaf photosynthesis. This
   approach is likely to become especially attractive as land surface
   schemes are extended to simulate CO2 fluxes, since the shared
   environmental dependences of canopy conductance and photosynthesis
   reduce the number of model parameters which require independent
   specification. This paper is concerned with the evaluation of canopy
   level relationships between photosynthesis and conductance using data
   from the first international satellite land surface climatology project
   (ISLSCP) held experiment (FIFE). Simultaneous measurements of CO2 and
   water vapour fluxes, taken over a predominantly C-4 grassland, are used
   to independently test the conductance and photosynthesis models. Based
   on these tests, a simple coupled model of canopy conductance and
   photosynthesis is developed which produces a good match to the
   experimental data. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Using a stand-alone 1-dim soil and atmospheric boundary layer model, the
   feasibility of off-line variational soil moisture analysis by
   assimilation of near-surface atmospheric observations is investigated.
   The experiments are performed using the soil module and boundary layer
   formulation taken from the regional forecast model of the German Weather
   Service. Assimilation experiments indicate that atmospheric information
   allows to initialize soil humidity to realistic values. Sensitivity
   studies using an adjoint code show that proper modeling of the soil
   moisture signal propagation into the atmosphere is crucial for the
   algorithm. An assessment of errors corrupting the fit resulting from
   erroneous cloud-cover specification is performed. The errors are found
   to be small for the case considered thus confirming the usefulness of
   assimilation of soil moisture for short-term weather forecasts even
   under non-perfect conditions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Title = {{Treatment of soil, vegetation and snow in land surface models: A test of
   the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme with the HAPEX-MOBILHY, ABRACOS

Abstract = {{Various components of the land surface, their individual hydrological
   processes and the process-oriented models are reviewed in this paper,
   with the focus on their application in global climate models (GCMs). The
   Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS) is examined regarding its
   performance for three different surfaces (crop, forest and grass), with
   available data from HAPEX-MOBILHY, ABRACOS and Russian data sets. The
   simulations of the key land surface prognostic variables, such as soil
   moisture and snow cover, are examined in detail because such validation
   has been lacking. Using the HAPEX-MOBILHY data, the impact of errors in
   the forcing variables on the uncertainties in the partitioning of total
   run-off and evapotranspiration is investigated, and the influence of the
   periodic forcing on soil moisture simulations is examined. Furthermore,
   an alternative empirically based approach for the soil evaporation
   efficiency is tested. The current framework of BATS soil hydrology,
   vegetation and snow schemes adequately reproduces observed soil moisture
   profiles for the three surfaces considered, and captures the seasonal
   evolution of snow mass. The simulations can be enhanced when
   site-specific information on surface parameters is available. Because of
   the realism of the overall framework of BATS, its inclusion in a GCM
   {[}the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate
   Model (CCM)] leads to reasonably realistic simulations of surface
   hydroclimatological variables. Further improving surface hydrology in
   global climate models is dependent on thorough tests of the available
   models using the available data, on the collection of long-term,
   seasonal, high-quality data, both at point and on larger spatial scales,
   and on the effective representation of the surface types on GCM scales.

Abstract = {{The Project for the Intercomparison of Landsurface Parameterization
   Schemes (PILPS) is briefly described. The partitioning of available
   energy between sensible and latent heat on the annual time scale is then
   described from the first two phases of this international project. In
   Phase 1, where synthetic atmospheric forcing is used to drive the
   landsurface models, equilibrium results show that there was considerable
   scatter in the partitioning of available energy, although this scatter
   was significantly reduced when the experimental design of Phase 1(a) was
   improved in Phase 1(c). Equilibrium results from Phase 2(a), where
   observational data were used for the atmospheric forcing, are then
   presented. These illustrate that about 70\% of those landsurface schemes
   included simulate the latent and sensible heat fluxes to within 5 W
   m(-2) of the observed value on the annual time scale, but since this 5 W
   m(-2) is equivalent to 63 mm year(-1) in total evaporation, this
   represents considerable variation in the partitioning of precipitation
   between evaporation and run-off. It is noted that the magnitude of the
   scatter appears to be related to the amount of annual rainfall. PILPS is
   working on understanding the reasons for this scatter more fully. (C)

Abstract = {{Recent investigations on various aspects of land-atmosphere interactions
   at the microscale and the mesoscale are summarized, for the purpose of
   reflecting on the type of Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT)
   schemes, needed for General Circulation Models (GCMs). It appears that,
   among all land-surface characteristics considered in advanced SVAT
   schemes, only stomatal conductance, soil-surface wetness, leaf area
   index, surface roughness, and albedo play a major role in the
   redistribution of energy at the ground surface. However, the
   relationship between these characteristics and the surface heat and
   momentum fluxes is strongly nonlinear. Furthermore, landscape
   discontinuities resulting from spatial heterogeneity of these
   characteristics, can induce atmospheric mesoscale circulations, which
   have a strong impact on the structure of the planetary boundary layer,
   clouds, and precipitation. These findings imply that appropriate SVAT
   schemes for GCMs need to provide higher statistical moments and
   characteristic length scales of the spatial distribution of the above
   mentioned five land-surface characteristics. The conceptual features and
   equations of a higher-order SVAT scheme are described here. This new
   SVAT scheme will probably not be able to mimic diurnal variations of
   land-surface fluxes at a precise location, but is expected to provide
   appropriate surface forcings, which trigger nonlinear atmospheric
   responses (including clouds and precipitation) at the microscale and the
   mesoscale. Furthermore, this new SVAT scheme is designed to directly use
   remotely-sensed parameters, which are not converted into pseudo plant
   and soil characteristics. Thus, this scheme is particularly convenient
   for data assimilation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The regional surface fluxes of sensible heat and moisture are estimated
   for two days during NOPEX `94 by means of aircraft measurements. A box
   flight pattern is analysed for 13 June (a weak wind case) and 14 June (a
   strong wind case), both with cold air advection. We perform a scale
   analysis in order to identify the main transporting scales of the
   turbulent fluxes and to investigate the mesoscale variability of the
   sensible heat and moisture flux. The example of a mesoscale moisture
   front indicates the importance of subgrid mesoscale variability. The
   turbulent fluxes of sensible heat and moisture are affected
   significantly by this mesoscale variability. This mesoscale variability
   is usually subgrid in numerical models and therefore must be
   parameterized. The source of the mesoscale moisture variability appears
   to be related to a cold front.
   Mesoscale flux divergence is explicitly included into the budget of
   sensible heat and moisture. The average vertical mesoscale flux
   divergence is small compared to the turbulent flux for the two cases
   investigated. However, the vertical mesoscale flux can be large locally.
   The budgets indicate the importance of horizontal advection for the
   NOPEX region. The time evolution of sensible heat and moisture during 14
   June appears to be dominated by large scale horizontal advection. A
   comparison between the area-averaged surface flux from aircraft data and
   surface flux stations for the 13 June is not conclusive because of
   fractional cloud cover. For the strong wind case on 14 June, the surface
   fluxes obtained from aircraft data and from surface flux stations
   disagree, which appears to be related with the pronounced mesoscale
   moisture variability. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The interface between land surfaces and the atmosphere is a key area in
   climate research, where lack of basic knowledge prevents us from
   reducing the considerable uncertainties about predicted changes. Boreal
   forests play an important, but not well known, role in the global
   hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. NOPEX (a NOrthern hemisphere
   climate Processes land surface EXperiment) is devoted to the study of
   land surface-atmosphere interaction in a northern European
   forest-dominated landscape. The main NOPEX region represents the
   southern edge of the boreal zone. It consists of a highly heterogeneous
   landscape, with forests, mires, agricultural land and lakes. A second
   study site, in northern Finland, representing the northern edge of the
   boreal zone, will be introduced into NOPEX in connection with its coming
   winter-time field activities. Field activities, dominating the initial
   phase of NOPEX, are conceived to strike a balance between the need to
   cover multi-annual observations and the resources required to carry out
   measurements covering all relevant spatial scales. The long-term data
   collection activities, the Continuous Climate Monitoring (CCM), form the
   backbone of the field programme. A suite of Concentrated Field Efforts
   (CFEs) covering periods of summer, spring and winter brings together
   scientists from more then 20 countries during month-long campaigns. CFEs
   have been carried out in May-June 1994 and April-July 1995. A third,
   winter-time CFE is planned for 1998-99. The System for Information in
   NOPEX (SINOP) is the database which forms a backbone for modelling and
   analysis work, dominating the second stage of NOPEX. A series of PhD
   courses are run in parallell to the research activities. Analysis and
   modelling are done in four interacting areas, including local-scale
   processes, meso-scale surface-atmosphere coupling and remote sensing
   techniques. The fourth area, regionalization methods, aims at bringing
   the previous three together in order to provide improved
   parameterization schemes for exchange of energy, momentum, water and CO2
   between land and atmosphere in hydrological and meteorological models
   from the meso to the global scale. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. Ail

Abstract = {{In large scale held experiments over the past 10 years, long wavelength
   microwave radiometers were used to map surface soil moisture with
   considerable success. These experiments, which include FIFE (87 \& 89),
   Monsoon `90, Washita 92 and 94, and HAPEX-Sahel, covered a wide range of
   climatic regimes. The results from these experiments show that the
   microwave emission at the 21 cm wavelength is a strong function of
   surface (0-5 cm) soil moisture and thus can be used to map spatial and
   temporal variations of the moisture content of this soil layer. The
   salient results from these experiments will be presented and compared.
   The use of the surface soil moisture data to determine geophysical
   parameters such as evaporative fraction, soil evaporation and soil
   hydraulic properties will be discussed and results presented. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The major bottlenecks of existing algorithms to estimate the spatially
   distributed surface energy balance in composite terrain by means of
   remote sensing data are briefly summarised. The relationship between
   visible and thermal infrared spectral radiances of areas with a
   sufficiently large hydrological contrast (dry and wet land surface
   types, vegetative cover is not essential) constitute the basis for the
   formulation of the new Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land
   (SEBAL). The new algorithm (i) estimates the spatial variation of most
   essential hydro-meteorological parameters empirically, (ii) requires
   only field information on short wave atmospheric transmittance, surface
   temperature and vegetation height, (iii) does not involve numerical
   simulation models, (iv) calculates the fluxes independently from land
   cover and (v) can handle thermal infrared images at resolutions between
   a few meters to a few kilometers. The empirical relationships are
   adjusted to different geographical regions and time of image
   acquisition. Actual satellite data is inserted in the derivation of the
   regression coefficients. Part 2 deals with the validation of SEBAL. (C)

Abstract = {{The surface fluxes obtained with the Surface Energy balance Algorithm
   for Land (SEBAL), using remote sensing information and limited input
   data form the field were validated with data available from the
   large-scale field experiments EFEDA (Spain), HAPEX-Sahel (Niger) and
   HEIFE (China). In 85\% of the cases where held scale surface flux ratios
   were compared with SEBAL-based surface flux ratios, the differences were
   within the range of instrumental inaccuracies. Without any calibration
   procedure, the root mean square error of the evaporative fraction
   \textbackslash{}DeIta (latent heat flux/net available radiation) for
   footprints of a few hundred metres varied from Lambda(RMSE) = 0.10 to
   0.20 Aggregation of several footprints to a length scale of a few
   kilometres reduced the overall error to five percent. Fluxes measured by
   aircraft during EFEDA were used to study the correctness of remote
   sensed watershed fluxes (1,000,000 ha):The overall difference in
   evaporative fraction was negligible. For the Sahelian landscape in
   Niger, observed differences were larger (15\%), which could be
   attributed to the rapid moisture depletion of the coarse textured soils
   between the moment of image acquisition (Is September 1992) and the
   moment of in situ flux analysis (17 September 1992). For HEIFE, the
   average difference in SEBAL estimated and ground verified surface fluxes
   was 23 W m(-2), which, considering that surface fluxes were not used for
   calibration, is encouraging. SEBAl estimates of evaporation from the
   subsealevel Qattara Depression in Egypt (2,000,000 ha) were consistent
   with the numerically predicted discharge from the groundwater system. Tn
   Egypt's Nile Delta, the evaporation from a distributed held scale water
   balance model at a 700,000 ha irrigated agricultural region led to a
   difference of 5\% with daily evaporative fluxes obtained from SEBAL. It
   is concluded that, for all study areas in arid zones, the errors average
   out if a larger number of pixels is considered. Part 1 of this chapter
   deals with the formulation of SEPAL. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   Radiometer satellite observations: comparison with field observations}},

Abstract = {{surface temperature (T-s), air temperature (T-a), atmospheric
   precipitable water (U), and vapor pressure deficit (D) have been derived
   from algorithms that use satellite observations of visible, near
   infrared and thermal infrared radiation in order to obtain higher
   spatial resolution data than is possible from meteorological station
   observations. The inferences of these four variables are compared with
   field instrument observations for sites with contrasted climates and
   vegetation including boreal forest (BOREAS), tropical bush savanna
   (HAPEX-Sahel), tall-grass prairie (FIFE) and a region with mountain,
   prairie and intensive agriculture (Red- and Arkansas-river catchments).
   The results showed that T-s could be retrieved with RMS errors of 3.5
   degrees C for a range of 48 degrees C; T-a with 3.9 degrees C over a
   range of 36 degrees C; U with 0.6 cm over a range of 3.6 cm; and D with
   10.9 mb over a range of 58 mb. Although the results had low absolute
   accuracies, the field data themselves are not without error-not least
   because, although the inferences were for a >1 km(2) area made
   instantaneously, they were compared with point field values generally
   not measured at exactly the same times in the day. Maps of retrieved
   variables had good relative accuracy and possibly better absolute
   accuracy than the comparisons with point measurements suggest. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The PROMET-family of spatial evapotranspiration models permits modelling
   of evapotranspiration at field scale, as well as microscale and
   mesoscale. The model-family consists of a kernel model (a SVAT based on
   Penman-Monteith and a plant-physiological model for the influence of
   environmental parameters on canopy resistance) and a spatial modeller,
   which provides and organises adequate spatial input data on the field,
   micro and mesoscale. Model results on the field scale show good
   agreement with measurements. Spatial data is set up using remote sensing
   and conventional data sources for a 150 x 100 km mesoscale test region
   in Upper Bavaria and a 7 x 13 km microscale test region embedded in the
   mesoscale area. The model is run on both scales. Microscale model
   results are successfully verified using field measurements and
   water-balance data taken from literature. Mesoscale model results
   compare well both with microscale model results and satellite-measured
   patterns of surface temperature. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, a model for hydrological equilibrium of leaf area index
   (LAT) is presented. The central assumption is that adaptation of
   vegetation to the local climate leads to a development of the canopy,
   which ensures a large light absorption but prevents severe soil water
   depletion. Particular attention has been paid to the processes which
   strengthen or weaken the basic LAI/evapotranspiration relationship,
   including soil moisture feedback on transpiration and evaporation,
   deciduousness of the canopy and interception losses. The annual water
   balance has been compared to stream flow data. A general agreement was
   found between simulated and observed run-off averaged over 28 large
   river basins. This shows that a water exchange scheme with explicit
   canopy processes can be used on a global scale. Vegetation aridity
   gradients are well defined by the hydrological equilibrium theory. An
   additional light availability constraint shows that the LAI, for wet
   tropics, some wet temperate and boreal areas, is not primarily water
   limited. An interesting point arises from an underestimation of the LAI
   and evapotranspiration in the rain forest margins and dry forests. This
   suggests that these areas are prone to recurrent droughts, and that
   drought resistance and avoidance strategies are of uppermost importance
   for vegetation function and therefore water cycle modelling. In
   particular, deep rooting may play a crucial role. The objective of
   modelling vegetation response to resources availability-here the water
   and light resources-is to improve our understanding of the biosphere as
   a resource-based system on a global scale, in the perspective of a
   change in atmospheric CO2 and corresponding climate modifications. The
   exact role of below-ground functioning, its links with carbon
   allocation, and especially the cost of deep rooting, emerge from this
   study as critical questions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) schemes in atmospheric
   general circulation models (AGCMs) require land-surface information.
   SVATs need this information to simulate the interactions between the
   atmosphere and the biosphere, in general, and to determine how the
   radiation absorbed by the surface is partitioned into sensible and
   latent heat, in particular. When investigating future climates,
   parameters can either be inferred from the tabulated, average
   characteristics of predicted biomes or computed locally, i.e. cell by
   cell. A null hypothesis is formulated to test if AGCMs can distinguish
   between the two approaches: `'For AGCMs, biome-based parameter inference
   is equivalent to cell by cell estimation''. The hypothesis is tested
   with a terrestrial biosphere model (TBM), the Ecological ModUle (EMU).
   EMU uses a set of primary and composite generic vegetation types to
   calculate local vegetation characteristics and to identify dominant
   assemblages. For the test, EMU is run with two different climate
   scenarios: a present climate and the Climate Change scenario for an
   equivalent doubling of the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide
   generated with the United Kingdom Meteorological Office AGCM. Results
   indicate that the two approaches are not equivalent. Consequently, the
   null hypothesis is rejected. Moreover, the differences in Vegetation
   characteristics are of a magnitude which should have noticeable impacts
   on exchanges of energy, water, and momentum between the atmosphere and
   the surface. This suggests that estimating vegetation locally should
   increase the credibility of AGCM investigations of Global Change. (C)

Abstract = {{Numerous field experiments have revealed that hydrological processes and
   parameters can show considerable spatial variability. When modelling the
   rainfall runoff process, the influence of this variability on the runoff
   should be assessed. For regionalization purposes, it is an important
   question if and how this variability is reflected in the behaviour on a
   larger scale. A quasi-three-dimensional, process-oriented model is used
   to understand the influence of spatial variability on the runoff
   behaviour. The study area, ``Neuenburger Pfad{''}, is a small loess
   catchment in southwestern Germany. Because of low infiltration capacity
   of the loess soil, runoff is produced by infiltration excess overland
   flow. Three examples are presented which elaborate on the effects of
   different types of spatial variability. The first example shows that an
   agricultural road plays a crucial role in the runoff behaviour of the
   investigated catchment. The second example studies the role of the
   spatial distribution of soil parameters. It demonstrates the importance
   of structured variability in heterogeneous fields. Purely random fields
   result in hydrographs similar to the homogeneous case, whereas fields
   with structured variability yield very different runoff. The third
   example is concerned with the effects of different soil moisture
   interpolations, which serve as initial state for the runoff model. The
   examples presented show that spatial variability can have a dominant
   influence on the rainfall runoff behaviour. For sound modelling, a close
   inspection of the particular catchment characteristics is necessary.
   Structured variability should be included in hydrological models because
   of the larger influence compared to stochastic variability. To
   understand the extent and the significance of catchment variability, an
   interdiciplinary teamwork should be fruitful. (C) 1998 Published by

Abstract = {{Global models of water and carbon cycles in continental vegetation and
   soils are usually forced with monthly mean climatic data-sets and thus
   neglect day to day variations of the weather. This treatment may be
   justified for empirical models based on parametrizations validated at a
   monthly timescale. Mechanistic models handling hydrological and
   biological processes at much shorter timescales might, however, be
   largely affected by such an approximation, since the various processes
   described are highly nonlinear. A random generator of daily
   precipitations and temperatures applicable at the global scale has thus
   been developed from worldwide meteorological data covering 6 years of
   observations. The probability of a wet day is correlated to the weather
   encountered the previous day. The amount of precipitation, the daily
   mean temperature and the diurnal. range of temperature are described
   from the statistical point of view by the cumulative distribution
   functions (CDF) of three random variables. The CDF's a relative to
   temperatures are different for rainy and dry days. This stochastically
   generated weather field is used as input to IBM (Improved Bucket Model)
   and CARAIB (CARbon Assimilation In the Biosphere), two global models of
   respectively soil hydrology and vegetation productivity. Large
   differences in both the geographical distribution and the global value
   of soil water, vegetation productivity and carbon stocks are obtained
   between the model runs using monthly uniform weather on one side and
   randomly generated weather on the other. The main contribution to this
   difference at the global scale arises from the precipitation generation
   occurring as a result of high degree of nonlinearity of the interception
   scheme used in IBM. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology is presented by which the variability of daily rainfall in
   space and time is summarized by a set of parameters of a stochastic
   point rainfall model. The spatial variability of the parameters of the
   Rectangular Pulses Poisson Model (RPPM) was investigated across a region
   of South-East Queensland, Australia. Daily data from 102 stations were
   used to calibrate the model parameters at each point. A suitable
   periodic function was fitted to the model parameters, which were assumed
   seasonal with a period of 1 year. A number of significant coefficients
   of the periodic functions representing the broad seasonal behaviour
   across the region were selected for each model parameter. The
   coefficients of the periodic functions were interpolated, to consider
   simultaneously seasonal changes within the year and variability between
   locations. Spatial interpolation of these coefficients was carried out
   by using thin plate smoothing splines as a function of position and also
   by considering the dependence of the interpolated surfaces on elevation.
   By incorporating the dependencies on elevation, the interpolated values
   showed a more complex pattern, which were in good agreement with the
   rainfall characteristics of the location and its interaction with the
   terrain. The reliability of the interpolated surfaces in representing
   the rainfall characteristics across the region was demonstrated with an
   independent set of locations which were not used in the fitting
   procedure. This shows the capability of the method in providing
   realistic stochastically generated rainfall at any point of the region
   without historical. information. It is anticipated that this methodology
   could be applied to the remaining parameters of a stochastic weather
   generator whose parameters could be calibrated from a sparse
   ground-based network with incomplete records. Applications of this
   analysis within the framework of the IGBP core project Biospheric
   Aspects of the Hydrological Cycle (BAHC) are also discussed. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{A variety of different methods have been proposed for downscaling
   large-scale General Circulation Model (GCM) output to the time and space
   scales required for climate impact studies. Using weather types to
   achieve this goal provides greater understanding of the problems that
   are involved compared to the many ``black box{''} techniques that have
   been proposed. Analyses using Lamb weather types, counts of weather
   fronts and air flow indices over the British Isles show strong
   relationships with daily rainfall characteristics such as the
   probability and amount of rainfall. Three versions of a weather type
   method are described for generating daily rainfall series. Two methods
   use an objective scheme to classify daily circulation types over the
   British isles along the lines of Lamb's subjective classification. The
   third method is based on user-defined categories of vorticity. Each
   method categorises rainfall events according to whether the previous day
   was wet or dry. All three methods successfully reproduce the monthly
   means, persistence and interannual variability of two daily rainfall
   time series during a validation period. A significant advantage of using
   vorticity is that it is a continuous variable and is strongly related to
   the probability of rainfall and the magnitude of rainfall events. The
   paper ends with a discussion of the issues relevant to the application
   of this method to the development of climate scenarios from GCMs. (C)

Title = {{A case study of statistical downscaling in Australia using weather
   classification by recursive partitioning}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Pages = {{362-379}},

Abstract = {{Because of their coarse resolution General Circulation Models (GCMs)
   lack the ability to predict reliably surface variables that may be
   needed for climate effects studies on a regional scale. Stochastic
   downscaling methods, based on the relationship between large-scale
   circulation types and regional surface variables, offer one approach to
   bridge this scale mismatch. The method explored in this paper uses
   recursive partitioning (also known as Classification Tree Analysis) to
   identify circulation patterns (weather states) in observed sea level
   pressure (SLP) fields that are most closely related to certain rainfall
   occurrence patterns (dry/wet) at multiple stations. The joint
   distribution functions of rainfall amounts at a set of stations are then
   used to define a statistical model for rainfall conditional on these
   weather states and the previous day's rainfall occurrence/absence. This
   model is applied to SLP fields from control, 2 x CO2 equilibrium and
   transient 100 year GCM integrations performed at the Max-Planck-Institut
   fur Meteorologie, Hamburg to simulate local rainfall corresponding to
   the large-scale GCM climates.
   The weather generator is applied for several case studies in Australia.
   Four regions, one each in the West, the North, the Southeast and East of
   Australia are considered, for the summer and winter seasons,
   respectively. These regions correspond to different climate zones: the
   North has mainly summer monsoon rain, the West has dominant frontal
   winter rainfall, and moderate Southeast has a relatively uniform
   rainfall distribution throughout the year. Thus, the performance of the
   weather generator in different climatic regimes can be evaluated.
   Since rainfall amounts are simulated by sampling from historical data a
   statistical uncertainty is attached to the generated rainfall sequences
   which is due to the procedure used. This is reflected in uncertainties
   of the downscaled mean rainfall of generally less than +/- 10\%, with
   larger numerical intervals for dry stations and seasons. The effects of
   a 2 x CO2 signal in the equilibrium run on local rainfall are not
   dramatic. For the transient experiment there is an indication of more
   rainy days and a decrease in the length of dry periods in West Australia
   in winter. The strongest change is identified in the North in the
   monsoon season which would have decreasing rainfall. No unequivocal
   changes were found for the Southeast. However, consistent with earlier
   studies, the bias of GCM control simulations strongly affects the
   results, as the difference between precipitation statistics based on
   observed and control run pressure fields often exceeds the difference
   between GCM control and altered climate. Considering this deficiency in
   current GCM simulations, the disagreement between different climate
   models and the uncertainty attached to the statistical downscaling
   method, not too much reliance can be put on the relevance of these
   results for regional hydrologic impact modeling. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Low-frequency, high-magnitude daily rainfall amounts recorded at several
   sites in central and southern England were related to the prevailing
   Lamb Weather Types (LWTs), daily weather front and airflow data. Three
   statistically distinct weather-type clusters were indentified and used
   to construct a simplified frontal model of daily precipitation
   occurrence/amount. The model was calibrated against station data for the
   period 1970-1990 and used to reconstruct observed daily precipitation
   between 1875 and 1969 given the historic sequence of LWTs. Although the
   model reproduced the incidence of low-frequency, high-magnitude events,
   it failed to capture variations in mean wet day probabilities and
   wet/dry spell persistence. This inability was attributed to the general
   limitations of the weather classification methodology, which did not
   capture all aspects of the precipitation regime with equal levels of
   proficiency. Therefore, the prospects for downscaling high-resolution
   precipitation series directly from indices of mean sea-lever pressure
   rather than via weather patterns was discussed. Preliminary results
   indicate that relationships can be established between mean daily
   precipitation occurrence and airflow indices such as vorticity and
   strength of air how. However, further research is required to establish
   the value of such indices for modelling low-frequency, high-magnitude
   precipitation events. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{One task in BAHC is to develop a physical understanding of the weather
   generator (WG). The core of the WG concept is scale interaction,
   represented by upscaling and downscaling, between the gridscale
   atmospheric fields and the subgrid-scale hydrological and ecosystem
   patterns. This paper considers scale interaction in terms of the
   convective ( = latent plus sensible heat) and rain fluxes.
   Earth's surface and atmosphere are coupled through these fluxes.
   However, horizontal scale interaction in the free atmosphere is
   physically different from that at the surface. Upscaling atmospheric
   fluxes generates new sub-gridscale fluxes at the lower grid resolution,
   caused by the gridscale fluxes resolved at the higher grid resolution.
   Downscaling has to recover these secondary circulations, usually through
   mesoscale submodels. The same gridscale eddy effect is zero for surface
   fluxes because there is no cross-surface mass flux of air.
   The atmospheric fluxes on the various scales are quantified here with an
   atmospheric diagnostic model (DIAMOD) coupled to a surface flux model
   (SURFMOD). Two convectively active periods over Europe tone disturbed,
   one undisturbed) are considered. Upscaling from 100 to 1000 km
   horizontal resolution generates additional grid-scale eddy fluxes.
   However, these amount, in both cases, to just 10\% of the diagnosed
   fluxes that are sub-gridscale at 100 km; this suggests that the
   additional gridscale eddy effect may be negligible in convective
   situations. We further apply a simple downscaling recipe for disturbed
   periods (scale the rain flux profiles with the observed surface rain)
   and for undisturbed periods (scale the convective flux profiles with the
   observed surface latent plus sensible heat flux).
   At the Earth's surface, we study the upscaling-downscaling mechanism,
   not with diagnosed, but with modeled latent and sensible heat fluxes.
   With a simplified version of SURFMOD, plus the probability density
   function of soil moisture, we reproduce the fatal impact of taking mean
   soil moisture for calculating mean evaporation: evaporation can be
   underestimated by 25\% in dry situations and overestimated by 10\% in
   moist situations. We demonstrate how to completely remove this bias. The
   technique presented here can be generalized to a wide class of
   deterministic and statistical models and offers a rational framework for
   the aggregation problem and the WG problem in general. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A regionalisation methodology has been applied to catchments in England
   and Wales enabling estimation of daily flows for any catchment in the
   region for which physical data and records of rainfall and temperature
   are available. The rainfall-runoff model IHACRES has been calibrated to
   60 catchments to obtain a set of dynamic response characteristics (DRCs)
   describing the hydrological behaviour within the region. physical
   catchment descriptors (PCDs) indexing topography, soil type, climate and
   land cover were collated and linked to the hydrological model by
   overlaying catchment boundaries with a geographical information system.
   Relationships were derived to describe the DRCs in terms of the PCDs so
   that the model may be used to simulate flow for any catchment in the
   region, given the driving variables, i.e. rainfall and temperature. In
   the England and Wales region, rainfall loss parameters have been defined
   in terms of land use, climate and soil type, whilst hydrograph
   separation parameters were characterised using topographical and soil
   variables. The set of DRC-PCD relationships, which were obtained by
   balancing the dual objectives of hydrological integrity and statistical
   significance, has been satisfactorily validated on two additional
   catchments within the region. Analysis of calibration errors was aided
   by sensitivity tests at one of these catchments in which flow response
   to variations in DRCs was assessed. Finally, a simple land use scenario
   demonstrates an application of the methodology in which variation in
   PCDs may be used to assess the impacts of environmental change. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the simulation of the water balance components in
   surface schemes for modeling of the land-air exchange processes, used
   for atmospheric, hydrological and ecological numerical models, where the
   incorrect parameterization of surface water fluxes and prescription of
   the soil parameters can result in wrong partitioning of the surface
   energy into latent and sensible heat fluxes. In that sense, the module
   of the soil hydrology in the land-air parameterization scheme (LAPS) was
   considered. In order to establish the performance of this scheme in
   partitioning the land-surface water into water balance components,
   during long term integration, several tests were performed. The
   corresponding forcing data and observations were inserted from the
   HAPEX-MOBILHY data set. Tests for establishing the sensitivity of
   partitioning of the land-surface water into corresponding components on:
   (i) calculating the ground temperature and the deep soil temperature
   used in the soil heat flux term of the `force-restore' equation; (ii)
   number of soil layers used in the scheme; and (iii) some wet reference
   parameters were also conducted. The analysis presented was supported by
   some simple statistics. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The intertidal zone of estuarine wetlands is characterised by a
   transition from a saline marine environment to a freshwater environment
   with increasing distance from tidal streams. An experimental site has
   been established in an area of mangrove and salt marsh wetland in the
   Hunter River estuary, Australia, to characterise and provide data for a
   model of intertidal zone hydrology. The experimental site is designed to
   monitor water fluxes at a small scale (36 m). A weather station and
   groundwater monitoring wells have been installed and hydraulic head and
   tidal levels are monitored over a 10-week period along a short
   one-dimensional transect covering the transition between the tidal and
   freshwater systems. Soil properties have been determined in the
   laboratory and the field. A two-dimensional finite element model of the
   site was developed using SEEP/W to analyse saturated and unsaturated
   pore water movement. Modification of the water retention function to
   model crab hole macropores was found necessary to reproduce the observed
   aquifer response. Groundwater response to tidal fluctuations was
   observed to be almost uniform beyond the intertidal zone, due to the
   presence of highly permeable subsurface sediments below the less
   permeable surface sediments. Over the 36 m transect, tidal forcing was
   found to generate incoming fluxes in the order of 0.22 m(3)/day per
   metre width of creek bank during dry periods, partially balanced by
   evaporative fluxes of about 0.13 m(3)/day per metre width. During heavy
   rainfall periods, rainfall fluxes were about 0.61 m(3)/day per metre
   width, dominating the water balance. Evapotranspiration rates were
   greater for the salt marsh dominated intertidal zone than the non-tidal
   zone. Hypersalinity and salt encrustation observed show that
   evapotranspiration fluxes are very important during non-rainfall periods
   and are believed to significantly influence salt concentration both in
   the surface soil matrix and the underlying aquifer. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The bluegum (Eucalyptus globulus) has been widely grown in different
   parts of the world for multiple purposes. However, the possible adverse
   effect of converting natural forest watersheds into bluegum plantations
   on surface and sub-surface hydrology has been a major concern for
   researchers and planners. This paper critically evaluates the
   implications of coppiced bluegum plantations on hydrological behaviour
   during the 10 years of the second rotation using the paired watershed
   technique in a montane temperate humid climate. The coppiced bluegum
   growth (1982-91) on 59\% of the catchment area reduced the mean annual
   total runoff by 25.4\% and base flow by 27\% over the natural grassland
   as compared with 16\% and 15\%, respectively, during the first rotation
   of 10 years. Regression relationships between observed and computed
   monthly values indicated a relatively higher reduction in the total as
   well as base flow during the first coppiced growth as compared with the
   first rotation. Reduction in runoff was at a maximum during July to
   October, which uas ascribed to greater availability of rain water and
   hence its utilization during this period. The reduction during the dry
   period (January-April) is crucial for sustaining dry weather flow in the
   hydro-electric reservoirs. The increased utilization of water during the
   second rotation was as a result of the deep root system right from the
   earliest growth which produced 42\% more biomass and 40\% higher
   economic returns (at 1982-83 price level) than the first rotation. For
   the year following the harvest of bluegum trees of the first rotation,
   the hydrological behaviour was similar to the pre-treatment conditions.
   The maximum growth of the coppiced shoots height and diameter at breast
   height (DBH) was noticed during second to fifth year as compared with
   fourth year onward in the first rotation. Moisture extraction from
   deeper soil layers by coppice growth was significant (alpha = 0.01)
   which was not true for the first rotation. Direct contact of tap roots
   with the ground water table was not observed during the second relation
   even through an extensive network of lateral roots was present. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Surface roughness parameters were determined for harvested wheat fields

   Testbed (CART) site in north-central Oklahoma. Measurements of wind

   in the atmospheric surface layer. Surface temperatures were measured
   radiatively over 750 m trajectories. Roughness heights were calculated
   for the region using the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The scalar
   roughness and the local momentum roughness were determined using wind
   speed measurements at 10 m and temperature measurements at 2 m combined
   with eddy correlation measurements for u({*}). The scalar roughness
   z(oh) was determined to be 0.0021 and 0.0038 m for the nadir and the
   off-nadir viewing angle, respectively. It was estimated that the
   displacement height d is negligible. A regional momentum surface
   roughness of z(o) = 0.15 m was determined by means of the radiosonde

Abstract = {{Two Monte Carlo-based approaches for assessing parameter uncertainty in
   complex hydrologic models are considered. The first, known as importance
   sampling, has been implemented in the generalised likelihood uncertainty
   estimation (GLUE) framework of Beven and Binley. The second, known as
   the Metropolis algorithm, differs from importance sampling in that it
   uses a random walk that adapts to the true probability distribution
   describing parameter uncertainty. Three case studies are used to
   investigate and illustrate these Monte Carlo approaches. The first
   considers a simple water balance model for which exact results are
   known. It is shown that importance sampling is inferior to Metropolis
   sampling. Unless a large number of random samples are drawn, importance
   sampling can produce seriously misleading results. The second and third
   case studies consider more complex catchment models to illustrate the
   insights the Metropolis algorithm can offer. They demonstrate assessment
   of parameter uncertainty in the presence of bimodality, evaluation of
   the significance of split-sample tests, use of prior information and the
   assessment of confidence limits on hydrologic responses not used in
   calibration. When compared with the capabilities of traditional
   inference based on first-order approximation, the Metropolis algorithm
   provides a quantum advance in our capability to deal with parameter
   uncertainty in hydrologic models. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{This article addresses the problem of aquifers where recharge can arise
   from runoff from less permeable areas. A distributed model is described
   which is used to estimate the runoff from various strata, this runoff
   can subsequently infiltrate into the aquifer as the water flows onto the
   permeable areas of the aquifer system. The approach is illustrated by a
   Limestone aquifer; in the model, direct percolation, infiltration, soil
   moisture storage, minor aquifer storage etc, are considered for areas of
   1 km(2). Runoff directed down the catchment, infiltration into the
   aquifer system can occur at the margins of the low permeability areas or
   when the streams pass onto the aquifer outcrop. Parameters of the runoff
   model are selected to reflect the physical processes, subsequently they
   are modified to match field measurements of runoff at three gauging
   stations located on the less permeable sub-catchments. The water balance
   and runoff calculations are carried out each day, the averaged values
   over half-monthly periods are used as input to a regional groundwater
   model. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{New semi-analytic solutions are obtained for well response to the
   pumping test and slug test performed on a partially penetrating well.
   The solutions account not only for the wellbore storage, infinitesimal
   skin, and aquifer anisotropy, but also for the mixed-type boundary
   condition at the well face, which is novel. The solutions are obtained
   via the method of dual integral equations (DE). The new solutions are
   computationally robust and efficient, about one to two orders of
   magnitude faster than the corresponding finite difference solutions.
   Existing approximate solutions obtained with flux-flux discontinuous
   boundary conditions are compared to our DE solutions. The accuracy of
   the approximate solutions appears to be adequate for slender well
   screens. Our DE solution is computationally more efficient than the
   approximate solutions. Tn the range where the approximate solutions are
   less accurate the DE solution is about an order of magnitude faster.
   More important, the new solutions provide the correct distribution of
   the point flux (local velocity) along the well screen, unlike all
   existing solutions. This feature is essential in cases where vertical
   variations of hydraulic conductivity are sought (e.g. in flowmeter
   tests), and for tracer tests. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Periods of below average rainfall in the UK have emphasised the need for
   reliable estimates of groundwater recharge. Simple water balance models
   are often used to estimate direct groundwater recharge, but a
   significant effort is required to determine the land surface parameters.
   This paper describes a sensitivity analysis of such a model to determine
   the parameters having the greatest influence on estimates of recharge.
   The results of varying the vegetation canopy parameters for forest, and
   permanent and annual short vegetation, were analysed, in addition to
   varying the parameters of the soil moisture model. There were
   significant differences between the three land cover types but recharge
   estimates were relatively insensitive to the vegetation canopy
   parameters for short vegetation. However, principally due to the
   inclusion of a model of rainfall interception, recharge estimates were
   sensitive to the forest canopy parameters. Sensitivity to the parameters
   of the soil moisture model, particularly the rooting depth, and
   fractional available water content and fractional field drainable water,
   was found to be very high. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Nitrous oxide and other nitrogen species were measured in groundwater
   from the most important limestone aquifers in the UK. Nitrous oxide
   levels were generally very high, with concentrations exceeding the
   concentration of air-equilibrated water by up to 320 limes. The
   correlations between N2O, NO3 and dissolved oxygen, as well as the
   spatial distribution of these chemical parameters, were used to identify
   nitrification as the main N2O production mechanism in the investigated
   aquifers. Most of the N2O in groundwater appears to be produced via
   nitrification in the unsaturated zone, which is probably strongly
   supplemented by nitrogenous compounds from anthropogenic land
   applications. Nitrous oxide production in the saturated zone is less
   substantial and can also be denitrification mediated; denitrification
   under very reducing aquifer conditions can result in nitrous oxide
   consumption. The observed high N2O concentrations in groundwater, which
   are most likely caused by agricultural aquifer pollution, can
   potentially lead to large N2O emissions from aquifers to the atmosphere,
   which will contribute to the climatic forcing induced by higher
   atmospheric N2O concentrations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   good conditions for water transmission and storage, according to a
   laboratory study of 165 core samples from 4 boreholes. The mean values
   obtained for open porosity, specific yield and hydraulic conductivity
   for limestone were 0.015, 0.00006 and 1.94 x 10(-10) m/s, respectively;
   for dolomites they were 0.011, 0.0013 and 2.77 x 10(-10) m/s
   respectively. No clear relationship between hydraulic conductivity and
   depth was identified. Nevertheless, it was established that the matrix
   can retain small quantities of water, with the dolomite matrix
   exhibiting more favourable conditions for storing and transmitting

Abstract = {{A suite of chemical and isotope tracers (dissolved noble gases, stable
   isotopes of water, radiocarbon, and Cl) have been analyzed along a flow
   path in the Dakota aquifer system to determine likely recharge sources,
   ground water residence times, and the extent of mixing between local and
   intermediate flow systems, presumably caused by large well screens.
   Three water types were distinguished with the tracers, each having a
   very different history. Two of the water types were found in
   south-eastern Colorado where the Dakota is poorly confined. The tracer
   data suggest that the first group recharged locally during the last few
   thousand years and the second group was composed of ground water that
   recharged earlier during a cooler climate, presumably during the last
   glacial period (LGP) and mixed aged water. The paleotemperature record
   archived in this groundwater system indicates that south-eastern
   Colorado was about 5 degrees C cooler during the LGP than during the
   late Holocene. Similar temperature changes derived from dissolved noble
   gases in other aquifer systems have been reported earlier for the
   south-western United States. The third water type was located down
   gradient of the first two in the confined Dakota in western and central
   Kansas. Groundwater residence time of this water mass is on the order of
   10(4)-10(5) yrs and its recharge location is near the Colorado and
   Kansas border down gradient of the other water types. The study shows
   the importance of using multiple tracers when investigating ground water
   systems. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. ALI rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A statistical (hypothesis testing) method is described for analysing the
   effects of long-term (1 year) antecedent rainfall upon subsequent runoff
   This method which is regional, rather than stream-specific, was applied
   to the southeastern US coastal plain in Georgia for the study period
   1948-1994. Three sets of forty 12 month periods were used to classify
   antecedent rainfall into three populations: ``high{''} (+15 to +59\%
   normal), ``low{''} (-11 to -42\% normal), and ``normal{''} (-9 to +8\%
   normal). These groups were then interrelated with three,groups of
   `'subsequent'' rainfall, subdivided upon a similar basis. This resulted
   in the creation of nine unique subpopulations consisting of combinations
   of antecedent and subsequent periods. Subsequent periods of 3, 6, 12,
   and 24 months were used. A `'production ratio'' (runoff/rainfall) was
   defined for each subsequent period and then normalized with the
   long-term (47 year study period) average production ratio for those
   months. The nonparametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to
   evaluate differences between mean normalized production ratios for the
   nine subpopulations. The results of a critical hypothesis test revealed
   that production ratios return to normal between 1 and 2 years following
   a drought, given a return to normal rainfall conditions. This might
   represent the time required for contributions to streamflow from local
   ground-water flow systems to return to normal following a drought.
   Production ratios associated with `'high'' antecedent rainfall remain
   considerably greater than normal for a period of at least 2 years
   following a return to normal rainfall. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{The Little River, an ephemeral stream that drains a watershed of
   approximately ss km(2) in northern Florida, disappears into a series of
   sinkholes along the Cody Scarp and flows directly into the carbonate
   Upper Floridan aquifer, the source of water supply in northern Florida.
   The changes in the geochemistry of ground water caused by a major
   recharge pulse from the sinking stream were investigated using chemical
   and isotopic tracers and mass-balance modeling techniques, Nine
   monitoring wells were installed open to the uppermost part of the
   aquifer in areas near the sinks where numerous subterranean karst
   solution features were identified using ground penetrating radar. During
   high-flow conditions in the Little River, the chemistry of water in some
   of the monitoring wells changed, reflecting the mixing of river water
   with ground water. Rapid recharge of river water into some parts of the
   aquifer during high-flow conditions was indicated by enriched values of
   delta O-18 and delta deuterium (-1.67 to -3.17 per mil and -9.2 to -15.6
   per mil, respectively), elevated concentrations of tannic acid, higher
   (more radiogenic) Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios, and lower concentrations of
   Rn-222, silica, and alkalinity compared to low-how conditions. The
   proportion of river water that mixed with ground water ranged from 0.10
   to 0.67 based on binary mixing models using the tracers O-18, deuterium,
   tannic acid, silica, Rn-222, and Sr-87/Sr-86. On the basis of
   mass-balance modeling during steady-state how conditions, the dominant
   processes controlling carbon cycling in ground water are the dissolution
   of calcite and dolomite in aquifer material, and aerobic degradation of
   organic matter. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The study of drip rate and seepage water electrical conductivity
   (hereafter called conductivity) under one stalactite in the Pere Noel
   cave (Belgium), with data produced from an automatic station since 1991,
   demonstrates several previously unobserved features: (1) measurement of
   drop volume shows that, for 94\% of the time series, drop volume is
   constant (= 0.14 ml), but when discharge exceeds 48.2 drips min(-1),
   drop volume decreases, probably because of secondary drop formation; (2)
   the interannual drip rate variation is correlated to the annual water
   excess and its correlant, rainfall (R-2 = 0.98; exponential model); this
   result introduces a new improvement in the understanding of the
   previously investigated relationships between stalagmite annual laminae
   thickness and mean annual rainfall; (3) the drip rate shows a well
   marked seasonality: it increases abruptly in late fall or early winter
   and decreases slowly during spring, summer and fall. Increased discharge
   is accompanied by an increase in conductivity, which suggests that the
   flushed water is more mineralized and was stored in the karst aquifer
   for several months; (4) superimposed on these seasonal variations, there
   are two kinds of flow regimes which are driven by the atmospheric
   pressure: (i) a ``wiggles regime{''}, whose duration is 1-7 days in
   length and which is inversely proportional to the air pressure wiggles;
   it is explained by either a `'shut-off faucet'' process due to the rock
   formation stress, or to a change in the two-phases flow component
   proportions (air/water); (ii) an ``unstable regime{''} characterized by
   abrupt switches (<2 h) or oscillations with variable periodicities, from
   a few minutes to a few hours. These occur when the drip rate reaches a
   threshold (i.e. 240 drops 10 min(-1)); the chaotic behaviour of this
   phenomenon is discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Although there has been much debate over the potential health risks of
   nitrate in drinking water, there is a real issue of the costs associated
   with removing nitrate from drinking water supplies. In the Chalk aquifer
   system of north-east Norfolk, modern contaminants of a mainly
   agricultural origin produce high levels of nitrate (> 15 mg/l NO3-N) in
   the unconfined valley areas, whereas in confined regions the levels of
   nitrate are low and commonly below detection limits (< 0.04 mg/l NO3-N).
   To understand the source and fate of nitrate within this aquifer system,
   a detailed hydrochemical sampling programme has been completed in the
   River Bure catchment. Nitrogen isotope values (delta(15)N) for nitrate
   within the unconfined and semi-confined zones range between +4 parts per
   thousand and +10 parts per thousand, characteristic of nitrified soil
   organic nitrogen. However, many Chalk groundwaters possess high N-2/Ar
   ratios (39-72) indicating a significant contribution to dissolved N-2
   from denitrification. Denitrification is believed to be occurring within
   the overlying glacial deposits, providing a mechanism for naturally
   improving groundwater quality. delta(15)N values of low-nitrate
   groundwaters from the confined zone are isotopically light (-3 parts per
   thousand to +4 parts per thousand), inconsistent with an origin from
   denitrification: it is suggested that these waters have a
   pre-anthropogenic nitrate signature. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The problem of scales and particularly the modelling of macro or
   continental scale catchments in hydrology is addressed. It is concluded
   that the magnitude of the scale problem is related to the specific
   hydrologic problem to be solved and to the scientific approach and
   perspective of the modeller. A distributed modelling approach, based on
   variability parameters, is suggested for modelling of soil moisture
   dynamics and runoff generation. It is shown that the parameters of such
   an approach are relatively stable over a wide range of scales. An
   example of the application of a standard Version of the Swedish HBV
   hydrological model to the continental scale catchment of the Baltic Sea
   is shown and its usefulness is discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The calculation of surface runoff in distributed models may be carried
   out by the kinematic wave equation (complemented with an infiltration
   equation). When analyzing an element the use of this equation requires
   knowledge of the input coming from the neighboring upstream element(s).
   For this reason, an ordered list termed `kinematic cascade' here, which
   meets the condition that for any element in it, its upstream neighbors
   precede that element, should be defined prior to runoff calculations.
   The procedures needed to find the kinematic cascade, as well as the data
   structures defining the watershed model, an described. New algorithms to
   find this cascade for triangular irregular networks (TIN), as well as
   for regular grid networks (RGN), have been developed. Computer codes
   were written and tested for both types of watershed models. The main
   advantage of the proposed new algorithm, as compared to those in use, is
   that the resulting computer code is very simple, short and easy to
   implement in any computer language. Also a new way to treat a RGN model
   as a special case of TIN model is presented. This allows transferring
   the experience obtained in TIN to RGN models. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Lateral heat conduction across a large circular sunken pan located in a
   hot, dry environment is evaluated using a numerical procedure. Heat flow
   across the sunken pan-adjacent soil boundary is calculated using a
   two-dimensional soil plane. Calculations show that a large temperature
   differential across the pan-substrate boundary develops during the
   entire diurnal cycle during January and July, leading to consistently
   positive heat flow from the soil towards the sunken pan. Heat conduction
   across the pan-substrate boundary represents 10 and 34\% of net
   radiation over the sunken pan during July and January, respectively.
   This additional heat source, which is not available for shallow lakes,
   increases annual evaporation from the sunken pan by about 5-8\% in July
   and January, respectively. In hot arid environments, a sunken pan will
   overestimate evaporation from a nearby shallow lake/dam due to a larger
   surface roughness and consistently positive conduction heat flow across
   the pan-substrate boundary. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A novel semi-analytical solution for the interpretation of the
   constant-head permeameter test is introduced, which accounts for the
   correct mixed-type boundary condition at the wellbore, unlike all
   published analytical solutions. Capillarity can also be accounted for.
   The simplifications are that flow from the bottom of the borehole is
   neglected (therefore the solution is applicable to slender boreholes,
   where the pending depth is at least 10 times the radius) and capillarity
   can be modeled with a quasi-linear approach. The Green's function
   approach leads to an integral equation, the solution of which does not
   show significant ill-posedness. Two sub-cases are presented: the first
   neglects capillary effects (the all-saturated approximation) and the
   second (general solution) takes them into account. The all-saturated
   solution is successfully tested against finite element simulations. The
   corresponding values of the borehole shape factor C are slightly larger
   than the ones obtained with approximate analytical solutions from the
   literature. When capillarity is accounted for, C changes of a factor of
   10 when the dimensionless sorptive number A goes from typical values for
   fine soils to typical values for coarse soils (about two orders of
   magnitude of variation for A). This range shifts to lower values of A as
   the dimensionless borehole depth increases. Consequently, the
   all-saturated solution is a good approximation of the soil behavior for
   boreholes with large pending depth, and coarse soils. The proposed
   semi-analytical solution is fast to compute and thus it is possible to
   use it in an automated optimization technique to fit field data and
   estimate the field-saturated hydraulic conductivity and the sorptive
   number; this would not be feasible using a numerical solution. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{A study of the interaction between groundwater and surface water was
   undertaken within a small agricultural watershed in southern Ontario,
   Canada. Groundwater contributions to streamflow were measured along a
   section of stream during baseflow conditions and during rainfall events.
   Four techniques were used to estimate the contribution of groundwater to
   the stream along a 450 m reach (three during baseflow and one during
   stormflow conditions). Under baseflow conditions, streamflow
   measurements using the velocity-area technique indicated that the net
   groundwater flux to the stream during the summer months was similar to
   10 mi s(-1) m(-1). Hydrometric measurements (i.e. hydraulic gradient and
   hydraulic conductivity) taken using mini-piezometers installed in the
   sediments beneath the stream resulted in net groundwater flux estimates
   that were four to five times lower. Seepage meters failed to provide any
   measurements of water flux into or out of the stream, Therefore, based
   on these results, the velocity-area technique gives the best estimate of
   groundwater discharge. Hydrograph separations were conducted using
   O-18/O-16 isotopic ratios and electrical conductivity on two large
   rainfall events with different antecedent moisture conditions in the
   catchment. Both events showed that pre-event water (generally considered
   groundwater) dominated streamflow and the drain flow with 64\%-80\% of
   the total discharge contributed by pre-event water. High water table
   conditions within the catchment resulted in greater stream discharge and
   a greater contribution of event water in the streamflow than that
   observed under low water table conditions for similar intensity storm
   events. The results also showed that differences in riparian zone width,
   vegetation and surface saturation conditions between the upper and lower
   catchment can influence the relative magnitude of streamflow response
   from the two catchment areas. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Real uncertainties in the parameter values of conceptual models used in
   hydrology sometimes remain after calibration. While this is
   unacceptable, uncertainty analysis can provide useful information on the
   structural properties of the model. This information may then be used to
   modify the model or establish the limits of usefulness of the measured
   data. This paper focuses on the estimation and interpretation of the
   parameter uncertainties in such cases. The standard estimation method,
   based on the second-order approximation of the shape of the objective
   function in the vicinity of the optimum parameter set, provides an
   inaccurate description of these uncertainties. Instead a global
   approach, consisting of scanning the hypercube of the possible parameter
   values, is shown to give a good overview of these uncertainties. This
   gives not only a good general view of the shape of the objective
   function, but a good basis for interpretation as well. The efficiency of
   the method is illustrated using a four parameter urban stormwater
   quality model. The main conclusion is that the lack of measured data and
   its relative redundancy cause a significant interaction between the
   parameters, hindering calibration. Another example is given of something
   being reported by a growing number of authors: that data available in
   hydrology are only sufficient to support the development of models with
   limited complexity. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Low-frequency (interannual or longer period) climatic variability is of
   interest, because of its significance for the understanding and
   prediction of protracted climatic anomalies. Since precipitation is one
   of the key variables driving various hydrologic processes, it is useful
   to examine precipitation records to better understand long-term climate
   dynamics. Here, we use the multi-taper method of spectral analysis to
   analyze the monthly precipitation time series (both occurrence and
   amount) at a few stations along a meridional transect from Priest River,
   ID to Tucson, AZ. We also examine spectral coherence between monthly
   precipitation and widely used atmospheric indices, such as the central
   Northern Pacific (CNP) and southern oscillation index (SOI). This
   analysis reveals statistically significant `signals' in the time series
   in the 5-7 and 2-3 year bands. These interannual signals are consistent
   with those related to El-Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) and
   quasi-biennial variability identified by others. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In sparsely cropped farming systems in semi-arid tropics, rainfall
   partitioning can be complex due to various interactions between vertical
   and horizontal water flows, both in the atmosphere and in the soil.
   Despite this, quantifying the seasonal rainfall partitioning is
   essential, in order to identify options for increased yields. Results
   are presented on water flow components, based on field measurements and
   water balance modelling, for three years (1994-96) in a farmer's field
   cultivated with pearl millet {[}Pennisetum glaucum (L.) Br.] in the
   Sahel (Niger). Water balance modelling was carried out for three common
   infiltration categories: runoff producing surfaces, surfaces receiving
   inflow of runon water from upstream zones, and a reference surface with
   zero runoff and runon. Runoff was calculated to 25\%-30\% of annual
   rainfall (which ranged from 488 to 596 mm), from crust observations,
   rainfall, soil wetness data, and infiltration estimates. Inflow of runon
   was estimated from field observations to 8\%-18\% of annual rainfall.
   The parameters in the functions for soil surface and canopy resistances
   were calibrated with field measurements of soil evaporation, stomatal
   conductance and leaf area. The model estimates of soil water contents,
   which were validated against neutron probe measurements, showed a
   reasonable agreement with observed data, with a root mean square error
   (RMSE) of approximately 0.02 m(3) m(-3) for 0-160 cm soil depth.
   Estimated productive water flow as plant transpiration was low,
   amounting to 4\%-9\% of the available water for the non-fertilised crop
   and 79\%-24\% for the fertilised crop. Soil evaporation accounted for
   31\%-50\% of the available water, and showed a low variation for the
   observed range of leaf area (LAI <1 m(2) m(-2)). Deep percolation was
   high, amounting to 200-330 mm for the non-crusted surfaces, which
   exceeded soil evaporation losses, for 1994-95 with relatively high
   annual rainfall (517-596 mm). Even a year with lower rainfall (488 mm)
   and a distinct dry spell during flowering (1996), resulted in an
   estimated deep percolation of 160 mm for the non-fertilised crop. The
   crop did not benefit from the additional inflow of runon water, which
   was partitioned between soil water storage and deep percolation. The
   only exception to this was the fertilised crop in 1996, where runon
   somewhat compensated for the limited rainfall and the higher water
   demand as a result of a larger leaf area than the non-fertilised crop.
   The effects of rainfall erraticness, resulting in episodic droughts,
   explain why a crop that uses such a small proportion of the available
   water, in an environment with substantial deep percolation, still
   suffers from water scarcity. Application of small levels of phosphorus
   and nitrogen roughly doubled yields, from 380 to 620 kg ha(-1), and
   plant transpiration, from 33 to 78 mm. Evapotranspirational water use
   efficiency (WUEET) was low, 6500-8300 m(3) ton(-1) grain for
   non-fertilised crop, which is an effect of the low on-farm yields and
   high non-productive water losses. The estimated seasonal rainfall
   partitioning indicates the possibility of quantifying vertical water
   hows in on-farm environments in the Sahel, despite the presence of
   surface overland flow. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of the resistances to water vapor movement is a
   major difficulty in evaluating evaporation from soil. By including the
   temperature of a dry soil surface (the temperature of the surface of a
   dry soil column buried in the field), a method for estimating
   evaporation from soil is proposed. The necessary input variables for the
   suggested method are temperature, net radiation, and soil heat flux.
   There are three advantages of the proposed method over the conventional
   methods, First, soil surface resistance and aerodynamic resistance are
   not required. Second, the variables included are fewer. Third,
   measurement and analysis of the parameters involved are relatively easy.
   Sensitivity analysis shows that the suggested method is sensitive to
   temperatures, Test experiments were conducted in a sandy field, where a
   weighing lysimeter was installed. Evaporation from soil, together with
   the variables specified above, were measured. For temperatures measured
   by thermocouples, experimental results showed that the mean absolute
   error (MAE) for the daily evaporation over 22 days was 0.17 mm day(-1).
   The regression between calculated and measured evaporation was highly
   significant (r(2) = 0.89). Moreover, the intercept and slope of the
   regression equation were not significantly different from zero and
   unity, respectively, at the 0.05 probability level. Furthermore, by
   using the temperatures measured by infrared thermometers, the MAE
   between measured evaporation and estimated evaporation was 0.15 mm
   day(-1). The regression between them was highly significant (r(2) =
   0.94). In addition, the intercept and slope of the regression equation
   were not significantly different from zero and unity, respectively, at
   the 0.05 probability level. These results show that evaporation
   calculated using the proposed method is in good agreement with lysimeter
   measured values. By comparing with the temperature difference method, it
   was shown that the suggested method estimated soil evaporation more
   accurately than the temperature difference method. Therefore, it is
   concluded that the proposed method is not only a simple way for
   application, but also an accurate way to estimate soil evaporation. (C)

Abstract = {{The much contrasted orographic and climatic characters of southeastern
   France serve to establish a hydrological balance of the porous aquifers
   in the region. Comparing a regional average gradient of O-18 content
   versus elevation, which was calculated on low-water period karst waters
   content, with a -10.5 parts per thousand average delta of Alpine rivers,
   an estimate of the percentages brought to these aquifers is proposed
   under the form of an abacus. It appears that the main groundwaters of
   the Var, the Durance and the Rhone are fed by an average of 20-30\% of
   Provencal underground contribution, and 70-80\% shallow contribution
   from the Alpine rivers. These figures reveal that local supplies range
   between 25 and 10\% of the average yearly discharge flowing in the
   porous and shallow aquifers. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Most vegetated land surfaces contain macropores that may have a
   significant effect on the rate of infiltration of water under ponded
   conditions on the ground surface. Owing to the small-scale variations of
   the land topography (microtopography), only portions of the land area
   may get ponded during the process of overland flow. As the macropores
   transmit water at much higher rates than the primary soil matrix, higher
   macropore activation in ponded areas produces larger effective
   infiltration rates into the soil. Therefore, overland flow and
   infiltration into the macroporous vadose zone are interrelated.
   Representing the microtopographic variation of the land surface by a
   simple sine wave function, a method was developed to relate the pending
   area to the average pending depth which was determined by overland flow.
   A numerical model coupling overland flow and infiltration into the
   macroporous vadose zone was developed. Overland flow was simulated using
   the St. Venant equations with the inertia terms neglected. A single
   macropore model was used to simulate the infiltration into the
   macroporous vadose zone. The interaction between overland flow and the
   infiltration into the macroporous vadose zone was analyzed for a
   hypothetical watershed. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the
   interaction of macropore flow and overland flow is significant. For the
   conditions tested. the macropore Row and the overland flow were found to
   be more sensitive to the macroporosity and less sensitive to the
   microtopographic surface variation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Studies have illustrated the performance of at-site and regional flood
   quantile estimators. For realistic generalized extreme value (GEV)
   distributions and short records, a simple index-flood quantile estimator
   performs better than two-parameter (2P) GEV quantile estimators with
   probability weighted moment (PWM) estimation using a regional shape
   parameter and at-site mean and L-coefficient of variation (L-CV), and
   full three-parameter at-site GEV/PWM quantile estimators. However, as
   regional heterogeneity or record lengths increase, the 2P-estimator
   quickly dominates. This paper generalizes the index flood procedure by
   employing regression with physiographic information to refine a
   normalized T-year flood estimator. A linear empirical Bayes estimator
   uses the normalized quantile regression estimator to define a prior
   distribution which is employed with the normalized 2P-quantile
   estimator. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that this empirical Bayes
   estimator does essentially as well as or better than the simpler
   normalized quantile regression estimator at sites with short records,
   and performs as well as or better than the 2P-estimator at sites with
   longer records or smaller L-CV. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   landuse, which is characterized by a Mediterranean, semi-arid climate.
   The study includes an analysis of the relationships between rainfall,
   soil water content and discharge, as well as the establishment of the
   annual water budget. The results demonstrate a complex hydrological
   response. The relationships between the factors involved and the
   operating processes are difficult to explain because of the decisive
   role played by the valley bottoms. These areas typically possess a
   sediment fill, and contrast with the shallow soils developed on the
   hillslopes. Genesis and quantity of runoff (Hortonian or saturation)
   measured at the outlet depend on the antecedent moisture conditions of
   the valley bottoms because of their water-retention capacity. Annual
   runoff coefficients are similar to those reported from other semi-arid
   areas. The analysis of the annual water budget shows that rainfall is
   positively related with both actual evapotranspiration and discharge.

Abstract = {{A combination of micro-meteorological, soil physical and groundwater
   chemical methods enabled the water balance of a tropical eucalypt
   savanna ecosystem in Northern Australia to be estimated. Heat pulse and
   eddy correlation were used to determine overstory and total
   evapotranspiration, respectively. Measurements of soil water content,
   matric suction and water table variations were used to determine changes
   in soil moisture storage throughout the year. Groundwater dating with
   chlorofluorocarbons was used to estimate net groundwater recharge rates,
   and stream gauging was used to determine surface runoff. The wet season
   rainfall of 1585 mm is distributed as: evapotranspiration 810 mm,
   surface runoff (and shallow subsurface flow) into the river 410 mm,
   groundwater recharge 200 mm and increase in soil store 165 mm. Of the
   groundwater recharge, 160 mm enters the stream as baseflow in the wet
   season, 20 mm enters as baseflow in the dry season, and the balance (20
   mm) is distributed to and used by minor vegetation types within the
   catchment or discharges to the sea. In the dry season, an
   evapotranspiration of 300 mm comprises 135 mm rainfall and 165 mm from
   the soil store. Because of the inherent errors of the different
   techniques, the water balance surplus (estimated at 20 mm) cannot be
   clearly distinguished from zero. It may also be as much as 140 mm. To
   our knowledge, this is the first time that such diverse methods have
   been combined to estimate all components of a catchment's water balance.

Abstract = {{The familiar chain-dependent-process stochastic model of daily
   precipitation, consisting of a two-state, first-order Markov chain for
   occurrences and a mixed exponential distribution for nonzero amounts, is
   extended to simultaneous simulation at multiple locations by driving a
   collection of individual models with serially independent but spatially
   correlated random numbers. The procedure is illustrated for a network of
   25 locations in New York state, with interstation separations ranging
   approximately from 10 to 500 km. The resulting process reasonably
   reproduces various aspects of the joint distribution of daily
   precipitation observations at the modeled locations. The mixed
   exponential distributions, in addition to providing substantially better
   fits than the more conventional gamma distributions, are convenient for
   representing the tendency for smaller amounts at locations near the
   edges of wet areas. Means, variances, and interstation correlations of
   monthly precipitation totals an also well reproduced. In addition, the
   use of mixed exponential rather than gamma distributions yields
   interannual variability in the synthetic series that is much closer to
   the observed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   rather than simple least-squares estimators for the problem of finding
   unsaturated hydraulic parameters. Inversion of outflow data given
   independent retention data can be treated by an extension to a Bayesian
   estimator. As an example, we apply the methodology to retention and
   transient unsaturated outflow observations, both obtained on the same
   medium sand sample. We found the van Genuchten expression to be adequate
   for the retention data, as the best fit was within measurement error.
   The Cramer-Rao confidence hound described the true parameter uncertainty
   approximately. The Mualem-van Genuchten expression was, however,
   inadequate for our outflow observations, suggesting that the parameters
   (alpha, n) may not always be equivalent in describing both retention and
   unsaturated conductivity. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for establishing an optimal network design
   for the estimation of areal averages of rainfall events. The problem
   consists of minimising an objective function which includes both the
   accuracy of the areal mean estimation (as expressed by the kriging
   variance of estimation) and the economic cost of the data collection.
   The well known geostatistical variance-reduction method is used in
   combination with simulated annealing as an algorithm of minimisation.
   This methodology has several advantages which will be demonstrated in
   this paper. Several synthetic examples are shown in order to illustrate
   the performance of the methodology in two different optimisation
   problems: the optimal selection of a subset from a set of stations that
   already exist and the optimal augmentation of a previously existing

Abstract = {{Automated generation of drainage networks has become increasingly
   popular with powerful analytical functions in geographic information
   systems (GIS) and with the increased availability of digital elevation
   models (DEMs). This paper compares drainage networks derived from DEMs
   at two scales, 1:250000 (250K) and 1:24000 (24K), using various drainage
   parameters common in hydrology and geomorphology. The comparison of
   parameters derived from the 250K DEMs with those from the 24K DEMs in 20
   basins ranging from 150 to 1000 km(2) in West Virginia shows that the
   goodness-of-fit between parameter estimates based on the DEMs varies.
   Results clearly show that superior estimations are produced from the 24K
   DEMs. Better estimates can be obtained from the 250K DEMs for stream
   length and frequency parameters than for gradient parameters. However,
   the estimation of the mean gradient parameters based on the 250K DEMs
   seems to improve with increasing terrain complexity. Finally, basin size
   does not strongly affect the accuracy of parameter estimates based on
   the 250K DEMs. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The IRMB (Integrated Runoff Model-F. Bultot) daily step conceptual model
   has been applied to eight Belgian catchments with areas ranging from 100
   to 1200 km(2). These catchments are characterized by various
   infiltration rates and ground water storage capacities. The outputs of
   six GCMs (General Circulation Model) distributed by the IPCC
   (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and an earlier scenario have
   been used to perturb time series of hydrometeorological input data
   relevant to simulate the water cycle. This paper focuses on the impacts
   on streamflow and its surface and underground components, as well as on
   the occurrence of flood days and low flow days. impacts are shown to be
   catchment and scenario dependent. Due to the scenario diversity,
   streamflow impacts are found to be either positive or negative. The
   trends are common to scenarios with the same patterns or to catchments
   with similar characteristics. For all but two scenarios, all the
   catchments present an increase of flood frequency. Nevertheless, for all
   the scenarios, catchments with prevailing surface flow are undergoing an
   increase in flood frequency during winter months. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Surface soil moisture content exhibits a high degree of spatial and
   temporal variability. The purpose of this study was (a) to characterize
   variations in moisture content in the 0-5 cm surface soil layer along a
   hillslope transect by means of intensive sampling in both space and
   time; and (b) to make inferences regarding the environmental factors
   that influence this variability. Over a period of seven months, soil
   moisture content was measured (gravimetric method) on a near-daily basis
   at 10 m intervals along a 200 m downslope transect at the Rattlesnake
   Hill field site in Austin, Texas. Results indicate that significant
   variability in soil moisture content exists along the length of the
   transect; that variability decreases with decreasing transect-mean
   moisture content as the hillslope dries down following rain events; and
   that the dominant influences on moisture content variability are
   dependent upon the moisture conditions on the hillslope. While
   topographic and soil attributes operate jointly to redistribute soil
   water following storm events, under wet conditions, variability in
   surface moisture content is most strongly influenced by porosity and
   hydraulic conductivity, and under dry conditions, correlations are
   strongest to relative elevation, aspect and clay content. Consequently,
   the dominant influence on soil moisture variability gradually changes
   from soil heterogeneity to joint control by topographic and soil
   properties as the transect dries following significant rain events. (C)

Abstract = {{A reactive transport code (FEREACT) has been developed to examine the
   coupled effects of two-dimensional steady-state,groundwater flow,
   equilibrium aqueous speciation reactions, and kinetically-controlled
   interphase reactions. The model uses an iterative two-step (SIA-1)
   solution algorithm to incorporate the effects of the geochemical and
   microbial reaction processes in the governing equation for solute
   transport in the subsurface. This SIA-1 method improves upon the
   convergence behavior of the traditional sequential iterative approach
   (SIA) through the inclusion of an additional first-order term from the
   Taylor Series expansion of the kinetic reaction rate expressions. The
   ability of FEREACT to simulate coupled reactive processes was
   demonstrated by modeling the transport of a radionuclide (cobalt,
   Co-60(2+)) and an organic ligand (ethylenediaminetetraacetate, EDTA(4-))
   through a column packed with an iron oxide-coated sand. The reaction
   processes considered in this analysis included equilibrium aqueous
   speciation reactions and three types of kinetic reactions: adsorption,
   surface dissolution, and biodegradation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper presents the conceptual and mathematical development of the
   numerical model titled BIOKEMOD, and verification simulations performed
   using the model. BIOKEMOD is a general computer model for simulation of
   geochemical and microbiological reactions in batch aqueous solutions.
   BIOKEMOD may be coupled with hydrologic transport codes for simulation
   of chemically and biologically reactive transport. The chemical systems
   simulated may include any mixture of kinetic and equilibrium reactions.
   The pH, pe, and ionic strength may be specified or simulated. Chemical
   processes included are aqueous complexation, adsorption, ion-exchange
   and precipitation/dissolution. Microbiological reactions address growth
   of biomass and degradation of chemicals by microbial metabolism of
   substrates, nutrients, and electron accepters. Inhibition or
   facilitation of growth due to the presence of specific chemicals and a
   lag period for microbial acclimation to new substrates may be simulated
   if significant in the system of interest. Chemical reactions controlled
   by equilibrium are solved using the law of mass action relating the
   thermodynamic equilibrium constant to the activities of the products and
   reactants. Kinetic chemical reactions are solved using reaction rate
   equations based on collision theory. Microbiologically mediated
   reactions for substrate removal and biomass growth are assumed to follow
   Monod kinetics modified for the potentially limiting effects of
   substrate, nutrient, and electron acceptor availability. BIOKEMOD solves
   the ordinary differential and algebraic equations of mixed geochemical
   and biogeochemical reactions using the Newton-Raphson method with full
   matrix pivoting. Simulations may be either steady state or transient.
   Input to the program includes the stoichiometry and parameters
   describing the relevant chemical and microbiological reactions, initial
   conditions, and sources/sinks for each chemical species. Output includes
   the chemical and biomass concentrations at desired times. BIOKEMOD has
   been coupled with a hydrologic transport code, HYDROGEOCHEM, to allow
   the simulation of coupled advective-dispersive transport and
   biogeochemical transformation of pollutants in groundwater. Three
   verification exercises are compared with analytical solutions to
   demonstrate the correctness of the code. Two validation simulations of
   batch laboratory systems are compared with the laboratory data to
   demonstrate the code's ability to replicate behavior observed in real
   systems, and two validation exercises simulating reactive transport are
   presented to demonstrate the code's performance in simulating mixed
   equilibrium and kinetic biogeochemical reactions coupled with hydrologic
   transport. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the treatment of subsurface environments as
   reactive biogeochemical transport systems. We begin with an overview of
   the effects of microbial activity on the chemical dynamics in these
   environments. Then, after a review of earlier modeling efforts, we
   introduce a one-dimensional, multi-component reactive transport model
   that accounts for the reaction couplings among the major redox and
   acid-base elements, O, C, H, N, S, Mn, Fe and Ca. The model incorporates
   kinetic descriptions for the microbial degradation pathways of organic
   matter, as well as for the secondary redox reactions and mineral
   precipitation-dissolution reactions. Local equilibrium only applies to
   fast homogeneous speciation reactions and sorption processes.
   The model is used to simulate the distributions of chemical species and
   reaction rates along flow paths in two subsurface environments. In the
   first case, waters containing moderate levels of natural soil-derived
   organics supply a regional groundwater system. In the second case, a
   pristine aquifer is contaminated by an organic-rich leachate from a
   landfill. In both environments, the microbial oxidation of organic
   matter causes the disappearance of dissolved and solid oxidants and the
   appearance of reduced species, albeit over very different spatial
   scales. In the second case, a pronounced reaction front develops at the
   downstream edge of the contaminant plume. The reactivity, or
   biodegradability, of the organic matter is shown to be a major factor
   governing the biogeochemical dynamics in the plume. The simulations
   predict different distributions of the biodegradation pathways,
   depending on whether the organics of the leachate have uniform or
   variable reactivity.
   The secondary reactions also have a significant impact on the
   concentration profiles of inorganic species and the spatial
   distributions of the biodegradation pathways. Within the downstream
   reaction front, large fractions of O-2, Mn(IV), Fe(III) and SO42- are
   reduced by secondary reactions, rather than being utilized in the
   oxidative degradation of leachate organics, overall, the model
   simulations emphasize the strong coupling between subsurface
   heterotrophic activity and an extensive network of secondary reactions.

Abstract = {{Extension of reactive transport modeling to predict the coupled thermal,
   hydrological, and chemical evolution of complex geological systems is
   predicated on successful application of the approach to simulate
   well-constrained physical experiments. In this study, steady-state
   effluent concentrations and dissolution/precipitation features
   associated with crushed quartz and tuff dissolution at 240 degrees C
   have been determined experimentally using a plug-flow reactor (PFR) and
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques, then modeled with the
   reactive transport simulator GIMRT (Steefel and Yabusaki, 1996) using a
   linear rate law from transition State theory (TST). For quartz
   dissolution, interdependence of the specific surface area (A(m)) and
   reaction rate constant (k(m)) predicted from the modeling agrees closely
   with that obtained from an analytical solution to the reaction-transport
   equation without diffusion/dispersion, verifying the advection-dominant
   nature of the PFR experiments. Independently-determined A(qtz) and
   k(qtz) from the literature are shown to be internally consistent with
   respect to the model and analytical interdependence, implying
   appropriateness of the linear TST rate law and adequacy of
   BET-determined A, for use in modeling PFR experiments. Applications of
   this integrated approach for monomineralic dissolution include
   assessment of internal consistency among independent A(m) and k(m) data,
   estimation of k(m) from BET-determined A(m), and rapid evaluation of
   alternative rate laws. For such dissolution, accurate simulation of the
   experimental steady-state effluent concentrations (to within 3\% for Na,
   Al and K; to within 15\% for Si and Ca) and dearth of alteration phases
   (<1 vol.\% in the model) defines minimum supersaturation thresholds for
   nucleation of primary minerals (to suppress their secondary
   precipitation) and the (non-unique) relative k(m) of hydrous
   aluminosilicates. For such multicomponent, multiphase experiments,
   reactive transport simulators provide the only practical means of
   estimating and constraining these kinetic parameters. Despite the
   approximations and uncertainties inherent in present-day models, close
   agreement between the experimental and simulation results reported
   herein provides an important measure of confidence for extending the
   modeling approach to address increasingly complex systems for which
   development of experimental analogs is impractical or impossible.

Abstract = {{The effect of flow and particle-scale heterogeneity on the applicability
   of batch-derived reaction networks for Co(II/III)EDTA interaction with
   synthetic and natural Fe oxide-containing subsurface sediments was
   evaluated using batch and column systems. At pH 4.5 and 6.5, Co(II)EDTA
   reactions with sediments involved adsorption (within 0.2 to 2 h),
   followed by iron dissolution, forming Co2+ and Fe(III)EDTA (within 10 to
   300 h) and oxidation, forming Co(III)EDTA (within 5 to 50 h). Reaction
   parameters that were based upon numerous batch experiments, in some
   cases, poorly described reactive transport in columns. For five
   sediment/pH combinations, column breakthrough could be well described
   with systematic change in some reaction parameters which included:
   slower metal-EDTA adsorption rates; a greater number of adsorption
   sites; slower iron dissolution; and faster oxidation. Additional
   simulations were used to determine the significance and uncertainty in
   determining these reaction parameters in the 15-reaction system with 22
   species. Simulations that incorporated particle-scale heterogeneity with
   spatial distributions of adsorption site density, affinity, and rate
   could reproduce the column/batch trends that were observed, indicating
   that spatial averaging across reactive and nonreactive surface sites
   results in different single-valued reaction parameters needed to
   describe the column system as an equivalent porous media. The impact of
   solute advection and additional mass transfer in columns on accurately
   predicting column behavior with batch-derived parameters was not
   responsible for the batch to column disparity. This study demonstrates
   that while the nature of the reaction network (i.e. reaction identity
   and stoichiometry) is identical in batch and column systems, development
   of transport-relevant reaction parameters is needed for nonlinear
   reactions as particle-scale heterogeneities can significantly influence
   the apparent manifestation of the reaction network during advective
   flow. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mineral replacement in rocks consists of growth of guest mineral and
   dissolution of host. The two reactions are coupled by the grain-grain
   stress generated by growth of the guest grain in a rigid or very viscous
   rock in which it has initially no available room. This stress
   self-adjusts to make the volumetric rates of guest growth and host
   dissolution equal to each other, which accounts for the volume
   conservation typical of replacement. Volume preservation during
   replacement is required by conservation of mass and momentum as well.
   The two reactions are also simultaneous and proceed by a sequence of
   many tiny alternating increments; where these increments are small
   enough, internal textural details of the host grain or grain aggregate
   are morphologically preserved (as ghost textures) by the replacement.
   The strong variation of mineral reaction rates with stress required by
   replacement is evidenced also experimentally. Reported widespread
   replacement in many rocks (laterites, diagenesis of siliciclastics and
   carbonates, metasomatic ores, metamorphic rocks, and hydrothermal
   alteration) warrants creating water-rock reactive transport models that
   predict when and where in a system replacement should take place.
   Current geochemicaI models implicitly view replacement as sequential,
   uncoupled dissolution of host and growth of guest; this sequence of
   reactions may also occur in rocks, but crucially differs from
   replacement. Implications of replacement for water-rock reaction
   modeling include:
   1. balancing of replacement reactions on volume;
   2. use of Helmholtz (rather than Gibbs) free energies of minerals
   involved in replacement;
   3. taking account of the strong stress-dependence of mineral growth and
   dissolution rates in rocks; and
   4. taking account of possible accommodation of growth by local
   deformation (as well as pressure solution) of the host rock, and of the
   effect of strain rate ( = growth rate) on local rock viscosity. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The transport of reactive solutes is often influenced by multiple
   factors and processes. Complex mathematical models accounting for these
   multiple factors and processes are required to simulate accurately the
   transport of reactive solutes. There are numerous concerns and
   constraints associated with the application of mathematical models to
   the transport of reactive solutes, especially for field-scale problems.
   The specific issue of using calibration (fitting a model to measured
   data) for model evaluation and data analysis was examined in this paper.
   Selected laboratory data, as well as the results of the well-known
   Borden natural-gradient field experiment were used as case studies to
   illustrate the potential pitfalls of using model calibration for the
   analysis of reactive solute transport. It is shown that erroneous
   parameter values can be obtained from calibration if all significant
   transport factors are not properly represented. Perhaps of greater
   significance, the (mis)use of calibration can lead to a mistaken belief
   that the model accurately represents the physical system and, hence,
   result in a misinterpretation of the factors controlling solute
   transport. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The generation of acid mine drainage from overburden spoil piles at
   open-pit lignite mines is impacting the quality of groundwater and
   surface water bodies in large parts of the Lusatian mining area in
   Germany. Values of pH as low as 1 have been observed in the groundwater.
   After decommissioning, mine pits are generally converted to lakes which
   may also be acidic owing to the acidic groundwater discharge. The acidic
   effluent is generated by sulphide oxidation in the unsaturated zone of
   the spoil pile which generally extends to large depths as a result of
   dewatering. The long-term evolution of the acidification is still
   largely unknown.
   Our research focuses on the effects of physical and chemical
   heterogeneity caused by mixing of soil materials that may have already
   been oxidized to different degrees during the deposition of the spoil
   pile. Processes considered include variably saturated groundwater flow,
   oxygen diffusion in the soil gas, kinetic pyrite oxidation and acidic
   effluent generation, advective-dispersive transport of the aqueous
   components, equilibrium geochemical reactions between the chemical
   components and the soil minerals, and possible buffering and acid
   neutralization. Several existing numerical codes were coupled to
   represent the complete set of processes.
   Simulations were carried out in one and two dimensions using
   representative characteristics of mine spoil piles, with the
   two-dimensional representation being based on spatially heterogeneous
   random fields of hydraulic conductivity and sulphide mineral fractions.
   Results show the long-term evolution of the oxidation front, the mass
   flux of oxidation products and the effects of system heterogeneity.
   Under conditions of constant flow, the system is found to return to
   neutral conditions over a time period on the order of several decades.
   Further work, including sensitivity analyses with respect to the
   controlling parameters and model calibration using site-specific field
   data, will be necessary to obtain a full understanding of the complex
   interacting mechanisms. The simulation approach shows promise as a
   potentially useful tool for predicting the effects of sulphide oxidation
   on the water quality of pit lakes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B,V. All

Abstract = {{A multicomponent reactive transport model with mixed equilibrium and
   kinetic reactions is used to analyze alteration front geometry in
   discrete fracture-matrix systems. An analytical solution is used to
   verify the numerical model and to obtain an expression for mineral
   reaction front geometry under quasi-stationary state conditions. Both
   the analytical solution and numerical results suggest that the geometry
   of reaction fronts in a discrete fracture system can be characterized by
   the sum of two dimensionless parameters: phi D'/delta nu (phi =
   porosity, D' = effective diffusion coefficient in rock matrix, delta =
   fracture aperture half-width, and nu = fluid velocity in the fracture)
   and lambda(m)/lambda(f)(0) (lambda(m) = equilibration length scale in
   rock matrix and lambda(f)(0) = equilibration length scale in the
   fracture in the absence of matrix diffusion). In the case where the
   system is surface reaction-controlled, the first dimensionless
   parameter, which is independent of the reaction rate constants,
   dominates. From an analysis of a system described by linear reaction
   rates, this parameter can be used to predict quasi-stationary state
   concentration profiles and the distribution of minerals along the length
   of a fracture based on the one-dimensional diffusion-reaction profile in
   the rock matrix bordering the fracture. Numerical simulations of a
   multi-component problem involving dedolomitization resulting from the
   infiltration of hyperalkaline groundwater demonstrate that the
   dimensionless parameter phi D'/delta nu applies in more complicated
   multicomponent systems as well. This result suggests that field
   observations of matrix alteration perpendicular to the fracture may be
   used to predict mineralization along the fracture itself. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{A numerical multicomponent reactive transport model described fully in

   Multicomponent reactive transport in discrete fractures, I. Controls on
   reaction front geometry. J. Hydrol. (in press)] is used to simulate the
   infiltration of hyperalkaline groundwater along discrete fractures at
   Maqarin, Jordan, a site considered as a natural analogue to
   cement-bearing nuclear waste repositories. In the Eastern Springs area
   at Maqarin, two prominent sets of sub-parallel fractures trending NW-SE
   are approximately perpendicular to the local water table contours, with
   the slope of the water table indicating north-westward flow. Extensive
   mineralogic investigations {[}Alexander W.R. (Ed.), 1992. A natural
   analogue study of cement-buffered, hyperalkaline groundwaters and their
   interaction with a sedimentary host rock. NAGRA Technical Report (NTB
   91-10), Wettingen, Swizerland; Milodowski, A.E., Hyslop, E.K., Pearce,

   Phase III. SKB Technical Report TR 98-04, Stockholm, Sweden] indicate
   that the width of intense rock alteration zone bordering the fractures
   changes from about 4 mm at one locality (the M1 sampling site) to
   approximately 1 mm 100 m to the north-west in the flow direction (the M2
   site), suggesting a lessening of alteration intensity in that direction.
   Using this information, the dimensionless parameter delta nu/ phi D'
   (phi = porosity, D' = effective diffusion coefficient in rock matrix,
   delta = fracture aperture, and nu = fluid velocity in the fracture) and
   measurements of the local hydraulic head gradient and effective
   diffusion coefficient in the rock matrix, a mean fracture aperture of
   0.194 mm is calculated assuming the cubic law applies. This information,
   in combination with measured groundwater compositions at the Maqarin
   site, is used as input for numerical simulations of the hyperalkaline
   groundwater infiltration along fractures. The width of the alteration
   zones in the rock matrix bordering fractures is also used to constrain
   mineral dissolution rates in the field. The simulations predict that
   ettringite {[}Ca6Al2(SO4)(3)(OH)(12). 26H(2)O] with lesser amounts of
   hillebrandite and tobermorite (hydrated calcium silicates or CSH phases)
   will be the dominant alteration products forming at the expense of the
   primary silicates in the rock matrix and fracture, in agreement with
   observations at the Maqarin site.
   The simulations also come close to matching the pH of water samples
   collected along fractures at the M1 and M2 sites, with a fracture
   aperture of 0.22 mm giving the closest match with the pH data (within
   13\% of the value indicated by the rock matrix alteration widths). The
   simulations suggest two possible scenarios for the time evolution of the
   fracture-rock matrix system. Where rate constants for secondary mineral
   precipitation reactions are the same in both the rock matrix and
   fracture, the rock matrix tends to become completely cemented before the
   fracture. This results in a downstream migration of the hyperalkaline
   plume. In contrast, if rates are as little as one order of magnitude
   higher in the fracture than in the rock matrix, it is possible to seal
   the fracture first, thus causing the mineral zones to collapse upstream
   as a result of the reduction in fracture permeability. Sealing of
   fractures is observed at Maqarin and the simulations predict a mineral
   paragenesis in the fracture resulting from this scenario which is
   broadly compatible with field observations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Large-scale mining activities have generated a plume of acidic ground
   water more than 15 km long in the regional aquifer of the Final Creek
   Basin. A one-dimensional reactive-transport model was developed using
   PHREEQC to aid in the analysis of transport and chemical processes in
   the plume and to determine the uses and limitations of this type of
   modeling approach. In 1984, the acidic part of the plume had a pH as low
   as 3.4 and contained milligram-per-liter concentrations of iron, copper,
   aluminum and other metals. From 1984 to 1994, concentrations of
   contaminants in the alluvial aquifer in Final Creek Basin, Arizona,
   decreased as a result of mixing, recharge, remedial pumping and chemical
   reactions. For reactions involving gypsum and rhodochrosite, the
   equilibrium modeling assumption of a local geochemical equilibrium was
   generally valid. From 1984 to 1990, water along the simulated flow path
   was at equilibrium or slightly supersaturated with gypsum, and gypsum
   equilibria controlled dissolved concentrations of calcium and sulfate.
   Beginning in 1991, water in the acidic part of the plume became
   increasingly undersaturated with respect to gypsum, indicating that the
   gypsum available for dissolution in the aquifer may have been completely
   consumed by about 1991. Rhodochrosite precipitation was thought
   responsible for the measured attenuation in dissolved manganese in the
   neutralized zone.
   For reactions involving calcite, the assumption of a local geochemical
   equilibrium was generally not valid. Dissolution of calcite in the
   transition zone was not sufficient to establish equilibrium although,
   following neutralization, the calcite saturation index decreased to -1.2
   in 1986. Calcite undersaturation decreased along the flow path in the
   neutralized zone, and equilibrium was attained about 7 km downgradient
   of the transition zone. The assumption of a local geochemical
   equilibrium was not valid for oxidation-reduction reactions that
   involved iron oxides and manganese oxides. Kinetically controlled
   oxidation-reduction reactions continued in the acidic part of the flow
   path for years following the passage of the transition zone. Although
   the equilibrium approach helped to provide an increased understanding of
   contaminant transport at Final Creek, future work will require a kinetic
   modeling approach to more accurately simulate selected reactions between
   the plume and aquifer materials. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Characterization and performance assessment studies for the potential
   high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain have identified
   Np-237 as a radionuclide of concern for the proposed repository. To
   predict the migration of neptunium after a repository breach, an
   understanding of the relevant hydrologic and geochemical processes is
   required. The hydrologic flow in the unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain
   is dependent on the infiltration rate, the stratigraphy of the vadose
   zone, and the heat generated by the decaying radioactive waste. The
   geochemical processes that strongly affect Np-237 migration include:
   solubility-limited release of Np-237 from the near-field environment,
   aqueous speciation of neptunium into non-sorbing carbonate/hydroxy
   complexes and the sorbing NpO2+ cation, sorption of neptunium onto the
   zeolitic tuffs via an ion exchange mechanism, and radioactive decay. The
   finite element heat and mass transfer (FEHM) code was used to
   investigate the coupled effects of chemical interactions and heat on
   neptunium transport from the potential repository to the water table.
   The selective coupling method is introduced to solve these reactive
   transport problems. The simulations indicate that in the absence of
   irreversible changes in the hydrologic and transport properties, the
   heat pulse does not significantly affect the migration of neptunium, as
   the time scale of heat pulse propagation is shorter than the time scales
   associated with neptunium release and migration. Water chemistry,
   particularly pH, calcium, and sodium concentration significantly affect
   the retardation of neptunium by the zeolitic rocks between the
   repository and the water table. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Water quality changes were modelled along a flowpath in a plume of
   artificially recharged, pretreated Rhine water in the dunes of the
   Amsterdam Water Supply, after 24 years of infiltration. The
   hydrogeochemical transport model PHREEQC was extended with
   dispersion/diffusion and kinetics for selected chemical reactions. In
   the model the following reactions were included: cation-exchange,
   calcite dissolution and precipitation, and kinetic oxygen consumption
   and denitrification by oxidation of organic matter. Monthly-averaged
   values were used for the infiltration water quality. Traveltimes from
   infiltration area to sampling points were determined with chloride and
   tritium, and used to place the 3D field-observations in the 1D
   column-model. Values for CEC were variable for seven layers in the
   model.
   Infiltration of pretreated Rhine water in the dune aquifer can be
   considered an intrusion of more saline water. It caused desorption of
   Ca2+, in exchange for Na+, K+ and Mg2+ from Rhine water. Because of
   variations in total solute concentrations in infiltration water, local
   small scale freshening fronts (Ca2+ sorption, Na+ desorption) were
   created by seasonally decreasing salt concentrations. The
   undersaturation with respect to calcite in the infiltration water, and
   the CO2 produced during consumption of oxygen, resulted in dissolution
   of calcite. Precipitation of calcite occurred in response to desorption
   of calcium from the exchanger in the downstream parts, overall, a net
   dissolution of calcite was simulated. Good results were generally
   achieved for all components: sulfate, nitrate, chloride, alkalinity,
   calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, H-3 and O-2. The contributions of
   the different geochemical reactions to the water quality are illustrated
   with computer simulations for the individual processes. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Final Creek, Arizona receives an inflow of ground water with high
   dissolved inorganic carbon (57-75 mg/l) and low pH (5.8-6.3). There is
   an observed increase of in-stream pH from approximately 6.0-7.8 over the
   3 km downstream of the point of groundwater inflow. We hypothesized that
   CO2 gas-exchange was the most important factor causing the pH increase
   in this stream-aquifer system. An existing transport model, for coupled
   ground water-surface water systems (OTIS), was modified to include
   carbonate equilibria and CO2 degassing, used to simulate alkalinity,
   total dissolved inorganic carbon (C-T), and pH in Pinal Creek. Because
   of the non-linear relation between pH and Cn the modified transport
   model used the numerical iteration method to solve the non-linearity.
   The transport model parameters were determined by the injection of two
   tracers, bromide and propane. The resulting simulations of alkalinity,
   C-T and pH reproduced, without fitting, the overall trends in downstream
   concentrations. A multi-parametric sensitivity analysis (MPSA) was used
   to identify the relative sensitivities of the predictions to six of the
   physical and chemical parameters used in the transport model. MPSA
   results implied that C-T and pH in stream water were controlled by the
   mixing of ground water with stream water and CO2 degassing. The relative
   importance of these two processes varied spatially depending on the
   hydrologic conditions, such as stream flow velocity and whether a reach
   gained or lost stream water caused by the interaction with the ground
   water. The coupled transport model with CO2 degassing and generalized
   sensitivity analysis presented in this study can be applied to evaluate
   carbon transport and pH in other coupled stream-ground water systems.

Abstract = {{The formation of bauxite from a granitic protolith, at 25 degrees C, has
   been simulated using a modified version of the 1DREACT software far
   one-dimensional reactive transport, which uses a kinetic approach to
   describe the mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions. The rate
   laws describing these reactions incorporate the important effects of
   mineral surface area, pH, and solution saturation state, and are based
   on experimentally determined rates published in the literature. The
   original program has been modified to allow for a different treatment of
   the mineral surface areas and reaction rate laws.
   The results of long term simulations (>1 Ma) show the development of
   gibbsite-rich weathering profiles (bauxites), which are underlaid by
   muscovite-rich zones. These muscovite-rich zones are not observed in the
   field (the typical `bauxitic' profile consists of an upper gibbsite-rich
   and a lower kaolinite-rich zone). A strong nucleation barrier for
   muscovite could explain the absence of muscovite from the weathering
   profiles. The results also show that the infiltrating solutions get
   closer to saturation with respect to microcline than with respect to
   albite, in agreement with numerous field observations.
   The simulations also predict the formation of a 5-10 m thick
   gibbsite-kaolinite transition zone, which is in agreement with field
   observations, and argues for the applicability of the experimentally
   determined rates, or at least their ratios, to field conditions.
   Regarding the chemistry of the solutions leaving the weathering
   profiles, the Si/(Na + K) ratio of the waters increases to values higher
   than 3 with time (intense weathering), in agreement with some of the
   river chemistry data from the Guayana Shield reported by Edmond et al.

Abstract = {{SiO2 fluxes associated with contemporary solute transport in three
   deeply weathered granitoid profiles are compared to bulk SiO2 losses
   that have occurred during regolith development. Climates at the three
   profiles range from Mediterranean to humid to tropical. Due to shallow
   impeding alluvial layers at two of the profiles, and seasonally uniform
   rainfall at the third, temporal variations in hydraulic and chemical
   state variables are largely attenuated below depths of 1-2 m. This
   allows current SiO2 fluxes below the zone of seasonal variations to be
   estimated from pore-water concentrations and average hydraulic flux
   densities. Mean-annual SiO2 concentrations were 0.1-1.5 mM. Hydraulic
   conductivities for the investigated range of soil-moisture saturations
   ranged from <10(-9) to >10(-6) m s(-1). Estimated hydraulic flux
   densities for quasi-steady portions of the profiles varied from 6 x
   10(-9) to 14 x 10(-9) m s(-1) based on Darcy's law and field
   measurements of moisture saturations and pressure heads. Corresponding
   fluid-residence times in the profiles ranged from 10 to 44 years. Total
   SiO2 losses, based on chemical and volumetric changes in the respective
   profiles, ranged from 19 to 110 kmoles SiO2 m(-2) of land surface as a
   result of 0.2-0.4 Ma of chemical weathering. Extrapolation of
   contemporary solute fluxes to comparable time periods reproduced these
   SiO2 losses to about an order of magnitude. Despite the large range and
   non-linearity of measured hydraulic conductivities, solute transport
   rates in weathering regoliths can be estimated from characterization of
   hydrologic conditions at sufficiently large depths. The agreement
   suggests that current weathering rates are representative of long-term
   average weathering rates in the regoliths. Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Dedolomites are rocks formed by the replacement of dolomite with calcite
   which is driven by the infiltration of Ca-rich water. This process has
   been described in the literature as either increasing, preserving or
   decreasing porosity of the initial dolostone. According to textures
   observed in Prades, NE Spain, dedolomitization took place due to two
   simultaneous processes: non-pseudomorphic replacement of dolomite with
   calcite at the wall-rock of fractures; and pseudomorphic replacement in
   the bulk rock.
   A multicomponent reactive transport model is used to analyze the two
   dedolomitization processes observed. Diffusion of ions from the
   fractures was the driving force for non-pseudomorphic replacement. In
   the wall-rock, the dissolution of dolomite and precipitation of calcite
   took place in accord with a 1:2 stoichiometry. As a consequence of the
   mineral molar volume, the porosity was sealed and replacement limited to
   a rim on both sides of the fractures, According to calculations, the
   development of a rim took less than 500 years. Advection of ions from
   the top of the dolomite bed was the driving force for pseudomorphic
   replacement in the bulk rock. Due to the absence of empty volume for
   expansion, replacement was governed by the condition of equal volumetric
   rate for dolomite dissolution and calcite precipitation. According to
   calculations, pseudomorphic replacement of 1 m of dolostone was
   completed after about 10(5) years for reasonable values of flow
   parameters.
   As the infiltrating water was also undersaturated with respect to
   calcite, one stage of calcite dissolution postdated dedolomitization.
   This process was responsible for the widening of open fractures, where
   the dissolution front followed the dedolomitization front into the
   dolomite matrix. Intensive calcite dissolution was also developed,
   following the advective flux from the top of the bed downwards. Drusy
   calcite is observed to precipitate in the pore spaces which consist of
   intergrains, fractures, and dissolution cavities. This process is not
   predicted in detail by reactive transport calculations, although it may
   be due to calcite supersaturation of the solution resulting from
   pseudomorphic dedolomitization. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Key reservoir properties within the same depositional facies such as
   permeability, can be strongly altered in time and space by water-rock
   interaction during diagenesis. A reaction-transport and flow code,
   DIAPHORE, was developed to address these effects at the reservoir scale,
   by coupling multi-dimensional mass transport and water-rock reactions.
   DIAPHORE is a three-dimensional (3D), two-phase, finite-volume,
   reaction-transport simulator, which couples kinetirally-controlled
   dissolution and precipitation of minerals with equilibrium reactions of
   chemical species in the water phase. Mass transport of chemical species
   is coupled to geochemical reactions using an explicit method. DIAPHORE
   includes the feedback of chemical reaction upon texture (reactive
   surface area of minerals and porosity) and flow (permeability)
   properties. DIAPHORE is used to model the petrophysical effects of
   illitization on reservoir properties of sandstone in the Dunbar oil
   field (North Sea). This new approach to diagenetic modeling correctly
   predicts the amount of quartz and illite precipitated, along with the
   marked permeability damage observed in the Dunbar field. A simple
   one-dimensional (1D) case was used to highlight the fundamental
   diagenetic reactions taking place. The simulations correctly predict the
   sequence of illitization fronts (early thermodynamic instability of
   kaolinite and K-feldspar, followed by kinetically-controlled dissolution
   of albite and kaolinite) and the observed illite volume fraction.
   Hydrodynamic flow only influences the late illitization fronts resulting
   from albite and kaolinite dissolution. The 3D field-scale simulations
   fit the field data (permeability and illite volume fraction
   distributions). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A lake evaporation study was conducted on a small water-supply reservoir
   (8.8 km(2)) in Minas Gerais State, Brazil, during 30 months. Air
   temperature and humidity, wind speed and direction, sunshine duration
   and solar radiation were measured continuously, together with monthly
   water temperature profiles. This allowed the calculation of evaporation
   by the energy-budget Bowen ratio (EBBR) method, as well as evaporation
   estimates using a climatological model, the Complementary Relationship
   Lake Evaporation (CRLE), which is widely used by electricity companies
   in Brazil. The CRLE is probably the most complete model available for
   lake evaporation that requires only monthly means of air temperature,
   air humidity and sunshine duration (or solar radiation), and provides
   estimates not only of monthly evaporation but of the rate of change of
   stored enthalpy in the lake's waters and equilibrium temperature, a
   surrogate of the actual water surface temperature. Since all of the
   model's variables are amenable to physical interpretation, it is
   possible to relate them to the actually measured values. We have found
   that the Priestley-Taylor equation, which is the basis of CRLE's
   evaporation estimates, performs Very well under conditions of positive
   (upward) sensible heat flux. The model's equilibrium temperature
   underestimates the actual water surface temperature but follows the same
   seasonal pattern. The model's estimates of the rate of change of stored
   enthalpy are generally poor, making the CRLE generate evaporation values
   that are delayed and damped in comparison with the EBBR method. The CRLE
   tends to overestimate evaporation slightly (8\%) over the 30-month
   period. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An expression for the distribution function of peak runoff is derived,
   combining results of frequency analysis of rainfall volumes with the
   traditional concepts of runoff coefficients and the unit hydrograph.
   Rainfall volume, scaled with respect to its duration, is assumed to
   follow a gamma distribution, whereas for the runoff coefficient a beta
   distribution is applied. Hydrograph characteristics are considered to be
   deterministic variables. A closed form analytical expression is achieved
   when some minor simplifications are made. The approach is tested and
   validated against data from 17 small Swiss drainage basins, for which
   unit hydrographs have been determined. The runoff response of these
   basins is very different in relation to both the distribution of the
   runoff coefficient and hydrograph characteristics, which is also
   reflected in the behaviour of the distribution of peak flow. Four main
   response classes of basins are identified that can be related to the
   physiography of the basins. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The spatial variability of rainfall on Norfolk Island, which measures 8
   km by 5 km, is examined for the years 1991-93 at time scales from one
   hour to one year using a raingauge network of density 0.44 km(-2)
   sampling over 15 s intervals. Sites showed max:min ratios of up to 1.2:1
   and 2.5:1 for annual and monthly accumulations, respectively, and a peak
   difference in daily accumulations of 80 mm. Events lasting one hour or
   less which generated no rain at one site provided an average maximum of
   8 mm among the remaining sites (peak 28 mm). In the summers, integration
   over 16 days was needed before rain fell everywhere. Variability was
   assessed from distributions of numbers of sites with no rain when the
   island mean rainfall was non-zero. Data at individual sites greatly
   underestimated the frequency of island rainfall and varied in their
   ability to represent island-mean accumulations and correlate with
   island-mean time series. The distribution of rainfall showed some
   dependence on wind direction. Windward (leeward) sites tended to show
   deficits (excesses) of rain. The 15 s peak intensity was 511 mm h(-1)
   and many coherent, localised high-intensity events of extremely short
   duration were identified. Low accumulations at sites often correlated
   with a shorter duration of rainfall, and intensities during rain were
   similar to those at sites with high accumulations. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A dense network of high resolution rain gauges has provided data on
   spatial scales of about 1.5 km and time scales of 15 sec on Norfolk
   Island, where the topography is dominated by a 300 m hill that is found
   to modify the spatial distribution of rainfall depending on wind
   direction. A correlation method is used to track coherent storm motion
   so as to identify the dominant wind direction and speed. Transects are
   selected across the island in the wind direction and the rainfall
   interpolated along each transect. It is found that there is often a
   decrease in rainfall upwind of the hill, followed by an increase
   downwind of the peak. The ratio of downwind to upwind catches increases
   linearly with wind speed. These observations do not accord with the
   often accepted explanation using a seeder-feeder mechanism. A simple
   wind drift model is proposed, in which raindrops follow trajectories
   modified by the perturbed wind flow over the hill. The transects are
   approximated by bell-shaped hill profiles. Analytic solutions for
   potential flow over a cylinder are then used to find a streamline with a
   bell shape similar to a topography transect through the hill and aligned
   with the wind direction. This streamline is used as the solid surface
   boundary, thereby giving a direct analytic flow field for the
   bell-shaped hill. A streamfunction is found for drop motion, allowing
   rainfall variations to be predicted. A parameterisation is developed
   that explains the shape and magnitude of the observed rainfall
   variations along a transect. Agreement between the rudimentary model and
   observations is found possible to within a few percent This indicates
   that the wind drift process is viable as the dominating mechanism for
   determining rainfall distribution in the presence of low hills when low
   level moisture is absent. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The objective of this research is to incorporate mesoscale structure and
   microscale hydrodynamics into a solute transport model and to evaluate
   the worth of structural information in predicting solute movement within
   structured porous media. The structure of porous media is embedded into
   a two-region solute transport model in which the inter-region mass flux
   is characterized by mesoscale mass-transfer coefficients. The model was
   used to predict solute breakthrough in an undisturbed, fractured
   saprolite soil column. Diffusive mass transfer at the aggregate scale
   was explicitly accounted for by incorporating inter-region mass flux
   across the interface of fractures and matrix blocks. The other model
   parameters, including pore-region porosity, hydrodynamic dispersion
   coefficients, and flow velocities, were estimated independently using
   laboratory tracer injections, As a result, predictions were 50\% more
   accurate than those obtained using a simple single-fracture conceptual
   model that represents a least-information scenario. Intra-region
   dispersion coefficients were also calculated theoretically by using a
   Taylor dispersion equation and available data on fracture apertures.
   Using the theoretically calculated dispersion coefficients resulted in
   an additional 50\% gain of prediction accuracy, The theoretically
   calculated dispersion coefficients were orders of magnitude smaller than
   the experimentally estimated values that were obtained by fitting a
   discrete-fracture model to the experimental data. This result suggests
   that mesoscale spreading of tracer in structured porous media may be
   largely attributed to inter-region mass transfer. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A mathematical model is developed to interpret the early-time recovering
   water level following the termination of pumping in wells subject to
   turbulent head losses. The model assumes that turbulent head losses
   dissipate immediately when pumping ends. In wells subject to both
   borehole storage and turbulent head losses, the early-time recovery
   exhibits a slope equal to 1/2 on log-log plots of the recovery versus
   time. This half-slope response should not be confused with the
   half-slope response associated with a Linear flow regime during aquifer
   tests. The presence of a borehole skin due to formation damage or
   stimulation around the pumped well alters the early-time recovery in
   wells subject to turbulent head losses and gives the appearance of
   borehole storage, where the recovery exhibits a unit slope on log-log
   plots of recovery versus time. Type curves can be used to estimate the
   formation storativity from the early-time recovery data. In wells that
   are suspected of having formation damage or stimulation, the type curves
   can be used to estimate the `effective' radius of the pumped well, if an
   estimate of the formation storativity is available from observation
   wells or other information. Type curves for a homogeneous and isotropic
   dual-porosity aquifer are developed and applied to estimate formation
   properties and the effect of formation stimulation from a single-well
   test conducted in the Madison limestone near Rapid City, South Dakota.

Abstract = {{Formation damage induced by a chemical effect resulting from
   non-compatibility between the injected fluid and the reservoir has been
   studied extensively and is well documented. However, formation damage
   induced by a hydrodynamic effect of flow, and the combined effects when
   the salinity and flow rate are varied simultaneously, have been studied
   less. This paper describes results from a set of core flood experiments
   carried out with a variety of filtered NaCl solutions subjected to
   increased flow rates to investigate the mechanisms of formation damage
   induced by the release and capture of in situ particles. Regarding the
   release mechanisms, the results confirm the existence of a critical flow
   rate above which the permeability decreases as a consequence of the
   hydrodynamic release of particles. This critical flow rate is found to
   be higher than those observed in the literature, and is observed to
   increase with the fluid salinity as predicted by the electric
   double-layer theory. The higher the salinity of the fluid, the higher is
   the critical flow rate and the less is the permeability decrease.
   Regarding the capture mechanisms, filtering or size exclusion appears to
   be the principal cause of permeability decrease at high injection flow
   rates. The hydrodynamic effect can reduce the permeability by more than
   50\%, but is less severe than the chemical effect. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The changes in dielectric constant K-a during an infiltration test on a
   fractured basalt surface in south-eastern Idaho were monitored using
   time domain reflectometry (TDR). Because changes in K-a were caused
   largely by changing amounts of water in the formation and to a small
   extent by diurnal and seasonal temperature fluctuations, TDR served as a
   useful indicator of the moisture status in the formation. Our results
   indicate that wetting and drying were spatially variable within and
   immediately beyond a 7 x 8 m(2) pond. Various locations close to the
   surface responded to fast flow, whereas others showed evidence of poor
   hydraulic communication with the surface. Data collected during a
   rainfall event, which occurred a few days after pending ceased,
   indicated that this boundary condition evoked a similar hydrologic
   response to pending. This effort suggests that TDR is a useful tool for
   detecting moisture changes in fractured media. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{In the Campina de Faro, in the south of Portugal, agricultural practices
   have a large impact on groundwater composition. These practices involve
   pumping of water for irrigation from combinations of large diameter,
   shallow wells (noras) and small diameter, deep boreholes (furos). Excess
   irrigation water returns to the aquifer and mixes with water from the
   regional groundwater flow system. This irrigation return flow is
   concentrated by strong evapotranspiration and by hushing of fertilisers.
   The concentration increase induces cation exchange, whereby Ca on the
   soil exchanger is replaced by Na. The mixing in the aquifer allows
   application of a mixing cell model which may then be used to calculate
   transmissivities from the Cl mass balance. The calculations are
   complicated by the time-variant behaviour of Cl and the method is
   adjusted to calculate the change of chloride in time. Results from the
   calculations appear to be in good agreement with hydrochemical
   observations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of the colored noise effect in parameter estimation for
   a linear model is to make the estimators tend to the true values as
   closely as possible. The differential hydrological grey model with dual
   series is adopted in this study. The least squares estimation of model
   parameters with the colored noise effect is applied. to improve the
   parameter identification. By using the shuffled complex evolution (SCE)
   algorithm, the parameter derived from the least squares estimation with
   the colored noise effect is optimized. Then, the degree of the colored
   noise effect affecting the parameter estimation of a linear model is
   investigated. The applicability of the proposed procedure to two
   watersheds in Taiwan is verified and the simulated results with and
   without the colored noise effect are compared. From the theoretical
   investigation and discussion, the superiority of the parameter
   estimation with the colored noise effect is proved. That colored noise
   effect plays an important role not only in parameter estimation, but
   also in simulation of the rainfall-runoff process, is also verified. (C)

Abstract = {{The groundwater concentrations of dinitrogen (N-2) and argon (Ar) were
   measured in a transect of a Danish riparian wetland in order to estimate
   N-2 production from denitrification, the concentration of Ar being used
   as an internal tracer for degassing, Dissolved N-2 increased by 135 mu M
   N-2-N. Simple calculations incorporating the decrease in groundwater
   dissolved Ar and the partial pressure of N-2 revealed that 376 mu M
   N-2-N was degassed along the transect. Total denitrification thus
   amounted to 511 mu M N-2-N, correlating well with the measured NO3-
   reduction of 503 mu M NO3-N. The total partial pressures of dissolved
   gases (N-2, O-2, Ar, and CO2) exceeded the hydrostatic pressure, thus
   confirming that degassing was a plausible mechanism for loss of
   dissolved gases in this riparian wetland, This study provides strong
   evidence that losses of dissolved Ar along a transect parallel to
   groundwater flow can be used to assess the amount of dissolved N-2
   degassed and thereby permit estimates of N-2 production under conditions
   without conservation of gases within the groundwater system. (C) 1998

   decomposition of expectation of rainfall into conditional expectation sf

   result, in addition to the accuracy of radar rainfall data in estimating
   rainfall given that rainfall is successfully detected, that in
   discerning rainfall from no rainfall can also be taken into account. To
   evaluate the estimation procedures, cross validation was performed using

Abstract = {{We simulate the accumulation of a chemical transported from soil to
   pending water. We consider one-dimensional convective-diffusive solute
   transport in water and soil, The results are compared with those of
   models which simulate an instantaneous mixing in the surface water layer
   and the surface solute flux dependent on the difference in solute
   concentrations between soil and water. Numerical inversion of Laplace
   transforms is used to obtain the simulation results for all models.
   Results of this work show that the relative effect of diffusion on the
   accumulation of a solute in pending water may be significant at
   infiltration rates that are not uncommon in agriculture practice. The
   results also imply that locations with low infiltration rates within
   fields may have a large effect on the overland accumulation of
   chemicals. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Multifractal analysis of the daily river how data from 19 river basins
   of watershed areas ranging from 5 to 1.8 x 10(6) km(2) from the
   continental USA was performed, This showed that the daily river flow
   series were multifractal over a range of scales spanning at least 2(3)
   to 2(16) days. Although no outer limit to the scaling was found (and for
   one series this was as long as 74 years duration) for most of the
   rivers, there is a break in the scaling regime at a period of about one
   week which is comparable to the atmosphere's synoptic maximum, the
   typical lifetime of planetary-scale atmospheric structures. For scales
   longer than 8 days, the universal multifractal parameters characterizing
   the infinite hierarchy of scaling exponents were estimated. The
   parameter values were found to be close to those of (small basin) French
   rivers studied by Tessier et al. (1996). The multifractal parameters
   showed no systematic basin-to-basin variability; our results are
   compatible with random variations. The three basic universal
   multifractal parameters are not only robust over wide ranges of time
   scales, but also over wide ranges in basin size, presumably reflecting
   the space-time multiscaling of both the rainfall and runoff processes.
   Multifractal processes are generically characterized by first-order
   multifractal phase transitions: qualitatively different behavior is
   shown for the extreme events in which the probability distributions
   display algebraic fall-offs associated with (nonclassical)
   self-organized critical (SOC) behavior. Using the observed flow series,
   the corresponding critical exponents were estimated. These were used to
   determine maximum flow volume exponents and hence to theoretically
   predict maximum flow volumes over aggregation periods ranging from 2(3)
   to 2(16) days. These theoretical predictions are based on four empirical
   parameters which are valid over the entire range of aggregation periods
   and compare favourably with the standard (GEV) method for predicting the
   extremes, even though the latter implicitly involve many more
   parameters: three different exponents for each aggregation period. While
   the standard approach is essentially ad hoc and assumes independent
   random events and exponential probability tails (which, we show,
   systematically underestimate the extremes), the multifractal approach is
   based on the clear physical principle of scale invariance which
   (implicitly) involves long-range dependencies, and which (typically)
   involves nonclassical algebraic probabilities. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{In aquifers containing large voids, such as karst aquifers with caves or
   basaltic aquifers with lava tubes, hydrographs at wells or springs are
   used to analyze the structure and response of the hydrogeological
   system. Numerical modeling of hydrograph response is commonly based on
   either inverse techniques or postulated flow geometries. However, the
   range of mechanisms for generating hydrograph responses have not been
   fully investigated,
   Physical modeling of these complex non-Darcian systems permits better
   understanding of the storm responses that conduit systems may generate.
   Using a numerical model of conduit flow systems which incorporates
   turbulent flow, some of the mechanisms that can alter storm pulses were
   investigated by treating them as combinations of pipes that connect
   reservoirs.
   The results indicate that the response of a conduit-flow aquifer can
   range from what has been called `diffuse' or `steady' to `conduit' or
   `flashy', without employing a diffusive component. A full range of
   behavior can be the result of changes from phreatic to epiphreatic
   conditions in a conduit, changes in conduit geometry, or multiple
   springs draining the same system. The results provide a quantitative
   tool to assess spring and well hydrographs, and illustrate mechanisms
   that can generate observed responses, which have previously been
   qualitatively interpreted. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The chemical composition of 185 groundwater samples collected from two
   catchments in the extreme NE Norway and NW Russia over the period April
   1994 to November 1995 is reported in terms of Ag, Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Bi,

   Pb, PO4, Rb, S, Sb, Se, Si, SO4, Sr, Th, Ti, Tl, U, V and Zn
   concentrations (as determined by ICP-MS, ICP-AES and IC), pH and
   electrical conductance. One catchment (C2) is located in Russia 5 km
   downwind of the nickel-copper ore smelting industry in Monchegorsk,
   which is a major SO2 and trace metal emission source, the other (C5) is
   located in Norway 30 km off-wind from the nickel-copper ore smelter in
   Nikel and 52 km off-wind from the nickel-copper ore roasting plant of
   Zapoljarniy, which are also significant emitters of inorganic
   atmospheric pollutants.
   Groundwater chemistry mostly reflects the mineralogical composition of
   the gabbro aquifer in C2 and the Quaternary deposits in C5, although
   groundwater in C2 also shows signs of incipient contamination from
   surface waters (heavy metals, sulphate, chloride). Groundwater in C2
   appears to have been acidified by S-compounds emitted from Monchegorsk,
   but the groundwater's capacity to neutralise incoming acidity has not
   been exhausted. In C5, groundwater has not been acidified to any extent
   and has a high acid neutralising capacity. This study demonstrates that
   the geological substrate of a catchment is a fundamental control on how
   groundwater responds to atmospheric pollution, even if the latter is
   severe. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on water flow of a 9-ha experimental irrigation site
   in a shallow water table area in the Tragowel Plains, Australia, with
   the aim of quantifying the processes affecting surface drainage
   and,groundwater levels. The irrigation site was intensively monitored to
   provide the required input and calibration data for modelling the
   physical processes. Simulation of flow processes, including
   infiltration, capillary rise, evapotranspiration, overland flow,
   groundwater exfiltration and groundwater flow into the drain, was
   performed using the physically-based, distributed model MIKE-SHE. The
   model was calibrated against the observed piezometric levels, drain how
   and soil moisture data collected over a 19-month period, that
   represented different field conditions under seasonal changes. Model
   simulations were generally consistent with the observed data. However,
   the results highlighted inadequacies of the model, particularly in
   representing variations in rapid flow through macropores that occur due
   to the cracking and swelling properties of the soil. Despite this
   deficiency, the modelling study allowed quantification of the effective
   flow processes and provided an insight into their implications in
   determining the quality (i.e. salinity) and quantity of drain flow and
   groundwater levels. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Evaporation functions compared on US watersheds: Possible implications
   for global-scale water balance and terrestrial ecosystem modeling}},

Volume = {{207}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of potential evaporation E-p are commonly employed in
   terrestrial water balance and net primary productivity models. This
   study compared a set of 11 E-p methods in a global-scale water balance
   model (WBM) applied to 3265 0.5 degrees (lat. x long.) grid cells
   representing the conterminous US. The E-p methods ranged from simple
   temperature-driven equations to physically-based combination approaches
   and include reference surface E-pr and surface cover-dependent E-ps
   algorithms. Cover-dependent parameters were assigned a priori based on
   grid cell vegetation. The WBM applies mean monthly climatic drivers and
   other biophysical inputs to compute water budgets on individual grid
   cells using a quasi-daily time step. For each E-p method water budgets
   were computed and compared against mean monthly; and annual streamflow
   from 679 gauged watersheds, assumed to be representative of the grid
   cells in which they reside. Procedures were developed for excluding
   watersheds for which this assumption was questionable, and 330 of the
   original 1009 watersheds were removed from further analysis. Among E-pr
   methods, the range of mean bias relative to observed runoff, and thus
   simulated actual evapotranspiration E-s, varied from approximately -100
   to +100 mm yr(-1); E-ps methods had a substantially smaller range, from
   about -50 to +50 mm yr(-1). These results agree well with previous E-p
   intercomparison studies at the point scale. Some individual methods from
   both the E-pr and E-ps groups yielded relatively small overall bias when
   compared with observed discharge data, suggesting the utility of simple
   as well as physically-based evaporation functions in continental- and
   global-scale applications. For any individual method, the spatial
   distribution of E-s across the US was significantly altered relative to
   that of E-p due to moisture-induced limits on soil drying. These
   limitations were most pronounced in hot, dry areas, where differences
   among E-p methods in excess of 700 mm yr(-1) were reduced to differences
   of less than 200 mm yr(-1) in E-s and runoff. There was a
   correspondingly higher sensitivity of E-s to the choice of E-p in more
   humid regions. These findings suggest that predictions made by
   macro-scale hydrology models like the WBM can be sensitive to the
   specific E-p method applied and that this sensitivity results in bias
   relative to measured components of the terrestrial water cycle. The
   adoption of particular E-p functions within such models should be
   conditioned upon the comparison of water budget calculations to suitable
   records of observed discharge. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Solute transport in soils can be described in terms of solute travel
   time probability density functions (pdfs). In the past, parameterized
   functional forms for the travel time pdf have been derived based on
   models of physical transport processes and the properties of the soil,
   or have been obtained from observed transport behavior. Alternatively, a
   nonparametric pdf for a particular soil can be measured experimentally.
   In general, this measurement requires deconvoluting the pdf, which is
   mathematically an ill-posed problem. In this paper we perform the
   deconvolution using a constrained regularization approach. The
   regularization method uses a basis function representation of the travel
   time pdf which eliminates numerical problems associated with the
   standard regularization approach. The method is tested using synthetic
   and experimental data. Regularized solutions are evaluated using
   Provencher's (Provencher, 1982a) F test statistic along with a visual
   inspection of their fit to the data. We analyze data from previously
   published field experiments and the results suggest multimodal travel
   time pdfs may be appropriate for modeling transport in soils. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{In a statistical approach to the study of watershed-lake water quality
   interaction, information about geology, land cover and soils was
   digitized in the drainage area of 87 chemically monitored lakes. With
   standard 1:50000 scale maps as the source of information, 33 classes of
   landscape elements were identified. Using geographical information
   systems (GIS) facilitated the determination of morphological element
   characteristics such as basic area and dispersal measures. The variables
   thus derived are used to test whether or not the dispersal
   characteristics affect lake water quality. It is concluded that they
   significantly enhance the performance of regression models in explaining
   inter-lake variances of the characterizing chemical constituents,
   namely, hardness, colour, total phosphorus, pH, alkalinity, conductivity
   and Secchi depth. General conclusions regarding annual chemical
   variability and probability density functions of morphology variables
   are also made. As a result, landscape elements can be ranked according
   to their general influence on lake water quality. With variable ranges
   being quite broad, the results should be valid in many glacial/boreal
   lakes throughout the world. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An event-based regional model for the frequency and magnitude of runoff
   events in the arid Negev of Israel has been developed. The model
   considers the number of events in a year, their arrival times, maximum
   observed discharges and volumes, the distribution of peak discharges and
   event volumes, and regional relationships between catchment area and
   magnitudes associated with 10- to 100-year recurrence intervals. The
   occurrence of events follows a negative binomial distribution with
   parameters estimated from the mean and the variance of the number of
   events in a year, which, in turn, are positively correlated with the
   mean annual depth of precipitation over the catchment. Arrival times of
   events follow the Pearson type-3 distribution. The enveloping curve of
   the maximum observed volumes is related to the catchment area by a power
   function. For catchments smaller than 250 to 300 km(2) in area, the
   discharges and volumes associated with 10- to 100-year recurrence
   intervals are found to be proportional to the catchment area. For large
   catchments, the discharge-area relationship may yield an inverse trend,
   and the volume may cease to increase as the area increases. Locations of
   the turning points for the relationships vary between watersheds. (C)

Abstract = {{A new and inexpensive technique to obtain vertical hydrochemical
   profiles in aquifers is presented. The Dual Pumping Technique (DPT) is
   designed for use in fully-screened groundwater wells and represents an
   alternative to packer installations or similar sampling devices. Two
   pumps are placed at either end of the well screen. The ratio of their
   pumping rates is varied from 1 to 0. Depending on this ratio, the two
   pumps abstract variable portions of the influx distribution. A water
   divide develops in the well, separating the flow upward from the Bow
   downward. A set of samples from the upper and lower pump are taken for
   different pumping rate ratios. Measured solute concentrations in these
   samples, together with the influx distribution determined by flow
   logging, are used to reconstruct vertical concentration profiles. The
   measured data are evaluated with a simple, robust algorithm, which is
   derived in the text and exemplified in the Appendix, The DPT was used to
   determine vertical concentration distributions of chlorinated
   hydrocarbon solvents (CHS) and tritium in a contaminated aquifer near
   Heidelberg, Germany. Comparison of the concentration profile obtained
   with the DPT with CHS and tritium data from a 50-m distant multilevel
   well showed the principal applicability of the new technique. The
   pattern of the vertical concentration distributions was successfully
   identified with the DPT, but the absolute CHS concentration values were
   one order of magnitude higher in the multilevel well, due to the fact
   that the multilevel well is probably closer to the centre of the plume
   than the well used for the DPT. The H-3 values could be compared
   directly and showed an excellent agreement. Further evaluation of the
   DPT in a situation where a multilevel reference well is in closer
   vicinity to the test well is planned. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Lake Tele has a nearly perfect ellipsoidal shape and is surrounded by
   swamps and barely penetrable flooded forests in the heart of the
   Congo-Zaire watershed basin, and has intrigued the international
   scientific community for decades. In June 1992, a first Franco-Congolese
   multidisciplinary scientific expedition was finally able to reach the
   lake which is vast (23 km(2)) and shallow (3 m). Its volume is estimated
   at 71 x 10(6) m(3) and is 40\% filled with an organic silt layer a metre
   thick, Its hydrological exchanges are almost exclusively vertical with
   very little lateral contribution from the surrounding swamp. This leads
   to the observation that the waters are very slightly mineralized (< 3 mg
   l(-1)), but are very rich in organic carbon (44\% of suspended matter
   and of total dissolved matter) and are very acidic (pH < 4), In
   addition, a magnetic anomaly of some hundred nanoTesla from a magnetic
   body at shallow depth has been detected in the lake's northern half,
   although its origin remains unknown. Botanical and palynological
   observations suggest the persistence of a strongly hydromorphic forest
   environment for at least the last 6600 years. Identified pollen taxa,
   whether ancient or recent, come mainly from pioneer and colonizing taxa
   such as Macaranga, which tends to indicate that the forest is continuing
   to gradually fill in the lake. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The self-calibrated approach is applied to the stochastic analysis of
   groundwater flow and advective mass transport in the WIPP site. Multiple
   equally likely realizations of logtransmissivity fields are generated,
   followed by the solution of variable density groundwater flow and
   particle tracking. Five different cases have been analyzed. The first
   one regards the modeling of variable-density groundwater flow and the
   remaining four regard the generation of the logtransmissivity fields.
   Results show that (i) it is important to model variable-density flow as
   accurately as possible, (ii) conditioning to piezometric head data helps
   in reducing the uncertainty in flow and transport predictions, (iii)
   accounting for uncertainty in boundary conditions helps improving the
   match to measured heads, and (iv) the interpreted value at location P-18
   is not consistent with the model of spatial variability inferred from
   the data. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation of 54 years of hourly precipitation at Valentia, on the
   south-west coast of Ireland, shows a change point in the annual amounts
   in the years around 1975 (identified by the Pettitt-Mann-Whitney
   statistic). This results in a 10\% increase in the mean annual
   precipitation from a pre-1975 value of 1375 mm to a post-1975 value of
   1507 mm. Most of that increase is absorbed in the months of March and
   October. The frequency of hourly precipitation in March in the post-1975
   period is 57\% greater than that of March in the pre-1975 period.
   However, the magnitude of the hourly intensity of precipitation in March
   for both periods was similar. Significant changes in wet hour frequency
   also occurred in October with no corresponding change in hourly
   intensity. These results compliment findings by others, that regions in
   Northern European latitudes have experienced an increase in
   precipitation since the mid-1970s. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Groundwater residence time distributions are important when studying the
   impacts of non-point source poolution in shallow groundwatersheds
   (aquifer-stream systems) on stream water quality. The theoretical
   residence time distribution F(T) for unstratified groundwatersheds that
   are homogeneous with respect to porosity, recharge and aquifer thickness
   is a simple exponential function. This function F(T) is insensitive to
   watershed size, stream network and spatial distribution of hydraulic
   conductivity. It has been found that certain of the conditions
   previously presented as necessary for the validity of F(T) can be
   somewhat relaxed. In this paper, we explore the behavior of residence
   time distributions when these assumptions used in the development of
   F(T) are no longer met, and test the robustness of the theoretical
   distribution F(T) in such cases. Numerical experiments suggest that F(T)
   provides a suitable approximation to many groundwatersheds' residence
   time distributions, except when aquifer heterogeneities are few and
   distinct. Additionally, a new residence time distribution (F) over
   cap(T) is derived for a class of semi-confined stratified aquifers. (C)

   Mediterranean semi-arid region, Israel: delta O-18 and delta D

Abstract = {{Annual rainfall variations and processes in the upper vadose zone exert
   a profound influence on the chemical and isotopic compositions of waters
   of carbonate aquifers in semi-arid climatic zones. In order to define
   these processes we have studied the surface temperatures during rainfall
   events, the isotopic composition of rain, infiltrating and groundwaters.
   This study was carried out within a karstic terrain (Soreq Cave),
   Israel, located in Cenomanian dolomitic rocks, approximately 40 km
   inland of the Mediterranean Sea, and 400 m above sea level. The climate
   is typical of the Eastern Mediterranean semi-arid conditions, with a
   rainy winter and dry summer and the average annual rainfall in the area
   is similar to 500 mm.
   Close monitoring indicates that the delta D and delta(18)O values of
   individual rainstorm events decrease with increasing rainfall. Annual
   average isotopic values of years with rainfall of 500-600 mm do not vary
   systematically. Years with extreme rainfall values define a negative
   covariation between the delta(18)O and rainfall. The delta D-delta(18)O
   relationship of all rain events of more than 20 mm fall on the
   Mediterranean Meteoric Water Line (MMWL) with a slope of similar to 8
   and d-excesses of 20-30\%. These rain events occur when mid-winter
   surface temperatures are 5 to 10 degrees C. Rainfall events of less than
   20 mm, mainly occurring at above 10 degrees C, have slopes of less than
   8 and smaller d-excess as a consequence of evaporation processes beneath
   the clouds.
   Two main water-types infiltrating into the cave are recognized: slow-
   and fast-drip. Slow-drip occurs from the tips of stalactites and takes
   place throughout the year; these waters represent seepage water that
   remains in the upper vadose zone for up to several decades. Fast-drip
   emanates from fissures in the cave roof during the winter seasons; these
   waters represent vadose how with a short residence time of less than 1
   year. The infiltration of the fast-drip water into the cave depends on
   the fracture system of the rock cover and on the intensity of the
   rainstorms. In the inner parts of the cave, where the rock cover is
   thick, fast-drip starts only after several massive (>20 mm) rainstorms,
   whereas below a thin roof the response time of fast-drip is a few hours
   to a few days after intensive rainstorms. Both fast- and slow-drip water
   fall on the MMWL, indicating that they are derived mainly from the
   relatively intensive rainstorms that compose about 2/3 of the annual
   rainfall. Although fast-drip water represents massive rainstorms, their
   delta(18)O and delta D values are nonetheless higher by similar to 1\%
   and 10\% respectively, relative to the average rainwater composition.
   This indicates that the fast-drip water consists predominantly of water
   derived from intensive rainstorms admired with a minor component of
   isotopically O-18- and D-enriched water, which is represented by the
   slow-drip waters. The fast-drip waters are derived mainly from massive
   rain events at surface temperatures of 5 to 10 degrees C, which
   thermally equilibrate with the host rock and upon reaching the cave they
   have already acquired the mean temperature (similar to 20 degrees C) of
   the cave. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrology and water quality of lakes and wetlands are controlled by
   the exchange of water and solutes with adjacent uplands. We studied a
   small catchment in Saskatchewan, Canada, to evaluate the mechanisms of
   water and solute transfer between the wetland and the surrounding
   upland. Detailed measurements of hydrologic processes (precipitation,
   runoff, evapotranspiration, and subsurface flow) and chloride
   distribution are combined to improve the estimate of the transfer flux.
   This paper describes hydrologic processes and Part 2 describes the
   solute transport processes. Large snowmelt runoff occurs in the
   catchment, which transfers 30-60\% of winter precipitation on the upland
   into the wetland to form a pond in the center. Snowmelt water and summer
   precipitation infiltrate under the central pond. Infiltration accounts
   for 75\% of water leaving the central pond and evapotranspiration
   accounts for 25\%, Most of the infiltrated water flows laterally in the
   shallow subsurface to the wet margin of the pond and further to the
   upland, where it is consumed by evapotranspiration without recharging
   deep groundwater. The net recharge rate of the aquifer underlying the
   catchment is only 1-3 mm year(-1). Snowmelt runoff transfers water from
   the upland to the wetland, and shallow subsurface flow transfers water
   in the opposite direction. When the two processes are combined, they
   provide the paths for cyclic transport of solutes. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The quality of water in lakes and wetlands depends on the exchange of
   solutes with adjacent uplands. In many prairie wetlands, the input of
   water is dominated by snowmelt runoff and the output is dominated by
   groundwater flow. We use chloride as a tracer to quantify the mass
   transfer processes associated with surface runoff and groundwater flow
   between a wetland in Saskatchewan, Canada and the surrounding upland.
   Snowmelt runoff transports 4-5 kg yr(-1) of chloride from the upland to
   the wetland. Most of this chloride infiltrates under the wetland and
   moves laterally to the upland with shallow groundwater. Under the
   upland, chloride moves upward in the vadose zone with soil water, and
   accumulates near the surface as water is consumed by evapotranspiration.
   part of this chloride mixes with snowmelt runoff and moves back to the
   wetland. Therefore, chloride is cycled between the wetland and the
   upland at an approximate rate of 5 kg yr(-1). The chloride cycle occurs
   within 5-6 m of the ground surface. A small amount of chloride escapes
   from the cycle with the downward flow of groundwater into the deep
   aquifer. The estimated flux of chloride leaving the cycle is 0.1-0.6 kg
   yr(-1), which is of the same order of magnitude as the rate at which the
   catchment receives atmospheric deposition of chloride. Because the
   atmospheric input is reasonably well known over the prairie region, the
   concentration of chloride in groundwater under recharge wetlands can be
   used to estimate the recharge rate of deep aquifers. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Areal estimates of soil moisture over large areas are required for the
   ground truthing of remotely sensed measurements and for establishing
   catchment-wide antecedent conditions for runoff simulations. There is a
   mismatch in scale between field (point) measurements and the areal
   estimates from both remote sensing and simulation modelling, so
   attention must be focused on developing sampling strategies that are
   able to determine accurate areal estimates of soil moisture using
   present (essentially point) techniques. In this paper, we use the
   concepts of time stability, applied to catchments with significant
   relief, to investigate the existence of certain parts of the landscape
   which consistently exhibit mean behaviour irrespective of the overall
   wetness. We denote these as catchment average soil moisture monitoring
   (CASMM) sites. Four data sets from three catchments (Tarrawarra,
   R5-Chickasha and Lockyersleigh) are examined. The catchments range in
   size from 10.5 ha to 27 km(2). Soil moisture measurements are made using
   time domain reflectrometry (TDR) or neutron moisture meters (NMMs), over
   depths from 30 to 120 cm. Time-stable locations representing mean areal
   moisture content are found in each catchment, i.e. CASMM sites exist.
   Although this analysis is preliminary, it points towards the possibility
   of a methodology for determining a sampling regime that could provide
   reliable estimates of areal mean soil moisture in complex terrain from a
   limited number of sample locations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The Simplex and the Shuffled Complex Evolution-University of Arizona
   (SCE-UA) optimization algorithms and the simple least-squares (SLS) and
   the heteroscedastic maximum likelihood estimator (HMLE) were applied to
   identify erosion parameters for a process-based model of catchment
   runoff and sediment yield. Four parameter identification problems were
   posed with the objective of studying the behaviour of the model under
   four optimization procedures. Error-free data as well as data with
   correlated error provided the means for determining the effectiveness of
   the optimization procedures studied. Results showed that the Simplex
   algorithm and the SLS objective function provided the best parameter
   estimates at lower levels of error, while the Simplex algorithm and HMLE
   objective function provided the best parameter estimates at higher
   levels of error. This was contrary to the expected theoretical outcome
   since the SCE-UA algorithm was more successful than the simplex
   algorithm in locating the global minimum on the response surface. (C)

Abstract = {{The qualitative and quantitative effects of macropore flow and transport
   in an agricultural subsurface-drained glacial till soil in eastern
   Denmark have been investigated. Three controlled tracer experiments on
   individual field plots (each approximately 1000 m(2)) were carried out
   by surface application of the conservative chloride ion under different
   application conditions. The subsequent continuous long-term monitoring
   of the rate and chloride concentration of the drainage discharge
   represented an integrated and large-scale approach to the problem. In
   addition, point-scale determination of macropore structure and hydraulic
   efficiency, using image analysis and tension infiltration, and of soil
   water content, level of groundwater table, and chloride content of soil
   water within the soil profile yielded insights into small-scale
   processes and their associated variability. Macropore how was evidenced
   directly by the rapid (within 10 mm of water input) and abrupt chloride
   breakthrough in the drainage water at 1.2 m depth in two of the tracer
   experiments. In the third experiment, the effect of macropore transport
   was obvious from the rapid and relatively deep penetration of the tracer
   into the soil profile. Dye infiltration experiments in the field as well
   as in the laboratory supported the recognition of the dominant
   contribution of macropores to the infiltration and transport process.
   The soil matrix significantly influenced the tracer distribution by
   acting as a source or sink for continuous solute exchange with the
   macropores. An average field-determined active macroporosity constituted
   0.2\% of the total porosity, or approximately 10\% of the total
   macroporosity. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The experimental results from a field-scale tracer experiment in a
   subsurface-drained glacial till soil were analyzed by the application of
   a single/dual porosity model (MACRO), optionally accounting for
   concurrent and interacting flow and transport in the bulk soil porosity
   as well as in the macropores. The model analysis showed that macropore
   flow is essential in describing the observed transport phenomenon on a
   short as well as a longer time scale. The diffusive exchange of solute
   between the matrix and the macropores was very sensitive and critical
   for the model prediction of the drainage concentration. The exchange was
   overpredicted and too rapid when the soil aggregate size (distance
   between macropores) obtained from an image analysis of soil cores was
   used in the model. On this basis, the model assumption of instant
   equilibration of the solute across the matrix porosity, disregarding
   small-scale concentration gradients, is questioned. Decreasing the
   domain exchange resulted in an improved model correspondence with the
   drainage chemograph. The drainage flow pattern was altered between
   drainage seasons owing to the changes in hydraulic efficiency of
   surface-vented macropores influenced by the physical disturbance and
   compaction of the soil surface. Hypothetically introducing fully
   surface-connected macropores into the calibrated model resulted in a
   22\% increase in the loss of solute to the drain, indicating the
   significance of the hydraulic conditions at the soil surface and the
   model specification thereof. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Snow storage on a coniferous forest canopy was measured using gamma-ray
   attenuation and tree weighing systems, along with measurements of
   throughfall, using two plastic sheet net rainfall gauges. Meteorological
   parameters were measured with an automatic weather station. Estimates of
   evaporation of intercepted snow show an average rate of 0.24 mm h(-1)
   and a maximum cumulative total of 3.9 mm in 7 h. Comparison with
   evaporation determined by a combination method with two different
   estimates of aerodynamic resistance (the ``standard{''} rain aerodynamic
   resistance nu(aL) and a snow aerodynamic resistance nu(aS)-an order of
   magnitude larger than nu(aL)) showed that nu(aL) overestimated the
   evaporation by a factor of 2.6, whereas nu(aS) gave fair agreement with
   the measured evaporation. A multilayer model may be needed to take into
   account the variations of latent heat source area. Using the long-term
   measurements of the weight of snow on a single tree the total
   interception evaporation was estimated to be of the order 200 mm
   year(-1). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Military institutions involved in the production and demolition of
   explosives, propellants, and pyrotechnics have the potential to degrade
   groundwater aquifers through the addition of numerous contaminants
   including nitrate. A nitrate plume has been identified in a karst
   aquifer beneath the Ammunition Burning Ground (ABG) at the Crane Naval
   Surface Warfare Center, Indiana, USA. Wells located in the vicinity of
   surface impoundments and burn pans used for treatment of explosive
   materials show the highest concentrations of nitrate ranging from 11.2
   to 19.6 mg l(-1) as NO3-. Little is known about the isotopic composition
   of nitrates originating from these processes. Eight wells within the ABG
   were sampled and analyzed for nitrogen isotopic composition of nitrate.
   An enrichment in the delta(15)N (delta(15)N = +8.9, +12.0, +13.1. and
   +13.5 parts per thousand) occurred at four wells located near the
   primary areas of disposal activities within the ABG. Four wells located
   near the outer limits of the ABG had delta(15)N values significantly
   lower than those observed in the central area of the ABG (delta(15)N =
   +4.0, +4.1, +4.6, and +2.0 parts per thousand). Soil samples and
   burn-pan ash samples were collected and analyzed for the nitrogen
   isotopic composition of nitrate. Three soil nitrate samples had low
   delta(15)N values of -1.7, -1.8. and +2.2 parts per thousand. The
   burn-pan ash sample produced nitrate with a delta(15)N value of +2.9
   parts per thousand. The observed enrichment in delta(15)N from samples
   taken from wells located near the ABG has been postulated to be a result
   of photodegradation or biochemical modification of RDX and TNT
   contaminated sludges and volatilization of NH3 in storage lagoons within
   the ABG. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the relative accuracy of four methods of producing maps of
   long-term runoff for part of the northeast United States: MAN, a manual
   procedure that incorporates expert opinion in contour placement; RPRIS,
   an automated procedure based on water balance considerations: PnET-II, a
   physiologically based model of carbon/water balance in forests: and
   MAPSS (Mapped Atmosphere-Plant Soil System), a rule/process-based
   vegetation distribution/water balance model. Our goal was to confirm the
   accuracy of the modeling and mapping procedures, and to see if any
   improvements to the models and methods might be suggested.
   In our analyses, we compared contour maps derived from the four methods
   both qualitatively (visual inspection) and quantitatively (raster
   overlay and uncertainty analysis). The manual and automated (RPRIS)
   methods gave the best results, our analyses suggest that methods
   directly integrating gaged runoff data (i.e. MAN and RPRIS) provide the
   best results under current climatic conditions. For predicting runoff
   under altered conditions. e.g. climate change, the existing models
   studied here (i.e, PnET-II and MAPSS) hold significant promise. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Groundwater was sampled from a number of wells along recharge pathways
   between fractured shale and karstic formations to evaluate the chemical
   and hydrologic mechanisms controlling the nature and abundance of
   groundwater colloids. The colloids recovered using low flow rate purging
   and sampling exhibited a composition and abundance consistent with
   lithology, flow paths, and effects of hydrology and aqueous chemistry on
   colloid mobilization and stability. In general, the larger-size colloids
   and Ca-containing colloids were more abundant in the karstic
   lithologies, while Na-containing colloids were more important in the
   shales. The composition of the colloids reflected recharge pathways from
   the fractured shale and dolomite formations on the ridges into the
   limestone in the valley floor. The Mg-colloids in the limestone reflect
   the possible contributions from the dolomite, while the Na, K, and Si
   reflect possible contributions from the shale, However, it was not
   possible to use the colloid composition as a signature to demonstrate
   colloid transport from one lithology to another. Mixing of recharge
   water from the shale with groundwater within the limestone formation and
   precipitation/dissolution reactions could account for the colloids
   present in the limestone without invoking transport of specific
   shale-derived colloids into the limestone formation. The abundance of
   colloids in groundwater appears to be controlled by both chemical
   factors affecting colloid stability, as well as physical factors related
   to hydrology (storm-driven recharge and water velocities). In general,
   colloids were more abundant in wells with low ionic strength, such as
   shallow wells in water table aquifers near sources of recharge at the
   top of the ridges, Increases in cation concentrations due to dissolution
   reactions along Bow paths were associated with decreases in colloid
   abundance. However, in spite of elevated ionic strength, colloid
   concentrations tended to be unexpectedly high in karstic wells that were
   completed in cavities or water-bearing fractures. The higher levels of
   colloids appear to be related to storm-driven changes in chemistry or
   flow rates that causes resuspension of colloids settled within cavities
   and fractures. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Intercepted saline groundwaters and drainage effluent from irrigation
   are commonly stored in both natural and artificial saline disposal
   basins throughout the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia. Their continued
   use as wastewater evaporation sites requires an understanding of
   existing groundwater dynamics. The useful lifetimes of individual
   basins, their sustainability and possible environmental impacts remain
   largely unknown. In this work, the movement of salt to the underlying
   groundwater system from Lake Tutchewop, a saline disposal complex in
   north-central Victoria, was modelled in cross-section. Due to the
   salinity contrast between the hypersaline basin waters and the regional
   groundwater, it was necessary to simulate density dependent flow
   behaviour. Under certain conditions, these density-stratified systems
   may become unstable leading to the onset of convective behaviour, which
   greatly increases the movement of salt from the basin to the groundwater
   system. Modelled concentration profiles in the aquifer system and
   calculated seepage rates from the basin show that Lake Tutchewop is
   stable under its present operating regime. The downward movement of salt
   is mainly controlled by diffusion and dispersion. The calibrated model
   was used to assess the impact of several management scenarios using
   time-dependent boundary conditions for lake salinity and water levels.
   The influence of heterogeneous basin linings on ensuing salt flux rates
   is examined, and results show that increased solute transport will occur
   under such conditions. A sensitivity analysis performed on governing
   variables showed that salt fluxes were most sensitive to lake salinity
   levels. A solute Rayleigh number defined in terms of basin salinity and
   hydrogeologic parameters is seen to be an effective tool for predicting
   the long term behaviour of such saline disposal basins. The models and
   concepts developed in this work may find application in the design and
   management of saline disposal complexes. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{A new analytical solution of the non-linear transient groundwater flow
   equation subject to time variable river boundaries was used to simulate
   stream/aquifer interactions in an alluvial valley aquifer. The
   differential equations were solved using the method of decomposition.
   The mathematical model required relatively few parameters to simulate
   groundwater elevations: hydraulic conductivity, specific yield, and
   recharge.The model was physically based and could simulate the process
   of a flood wave propagation into an unconfined aquifer. The model was
   tested using observed water table elevations at three locations across a
   2 km wide alluvial valley aquifer. The average daily deviation between
   observed and simulated water table elevations was approximately 0.09 m.
   The transient redistribution of water in the aquifer was simulated well
   with the model. The nonlinear form of the Boussinesq equation was shown
   to better simulate cases when the transmissivity of the aquifer could
   not be assumed to be a constant. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   (roughness, tillage direction and agricultural patterns, e,g, dead
   furrow or dirt tracks), we constructed a discriminant function based on
   field observations, This function enables us to decide whether flow
   direction for slopes of up to 15\% was imposed by slope direction or
   tillage direction. It can be applied to any location, provided there are
   known roughness, known slope intensity, known aspect and known tillage
   azimuth.
   In order to examine the effects of these agricultural activities at the
   catchment scale, we compared two models by analysing the same
   hydrological variables: the area contributing to runoff and the flow
   network. The first model (Topo) was built according to the runoff
   direction derived from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The second model
   (Tillage) was constructed by combining information from the DEM, and
   information from rules based on field observations or resulting from
   statistical analysis.
   For 23 basic catchments, the result of the comparison between the two
   models (Topo and Tillage) showed that a major part of the catchments and
   the drainage network was affected by modifications related to the
   introduction of man-made agricultural factors. For example, for 20 of 23
   catchments, the runoff flows over more than 50\% of the surface of such
   areas were produced along the direction imposed by tillage, The
   introduction of tillage effect brings about modifications of both the
   shape and size of catchments, (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Capture zones of wells play an important role in the protection of
   groundwater against pollution by persistent chemical compounds.
   Groundwater flow models can be used to delineate capture zones. As,
   however, the accuracy and uniqueness of such models may be poor, the
   outcome of a deterministic modelling exercise is likely to be
   unreliable. In such a case, stochastic modelling presents an alternative
   for the delineation of capture zones. In this paper, two methods are
   compared: the unconditional and conditional Monte-Carlo simulation. In
   each method. realizations of the aquifer characterized by a combination
   of recharge rates and transmissivity values are produced. For each
   realization, the capture zone of the well is determined by particle
   tracking. By superposition of all capture zones produced, a probability
   distribution is obtained that describes the probability of a point on
   the ground surface to belong to the capture zone. This probability is
   given by the fraction of catchments among all realizations which contain
   the point. Conditioning the calculation with measured heads usually
   implies a zoning or spatial resolution of the transmissivity
   distribution. The need for identification of lame scale features for a
   meaningful zonation is stressed. For a given zoned aquifer, the
   influence of successively adding measured heads used to condition the
   stochastics is studied. With an increasing number of conditioning heads,
   the probability distribution of the capture zone is shown to narrow.
   This method allows the quantification of the value of measured head
   data. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Modelling soil water dynamics and evapotranspiration for heterogeneous

Abstract = {{The main aim of the present work is to develop a mesoscale
   dynamical-stochastical model describing the processes of heat and water
   exchange at heterogeneous surfaces during the warm period of a year;and
   combining both determinism of physical processes and stochastic spatial
   structure of the main influencing factors. The analysis of mechanism of
   formation of soil water storage and evapotranspiration has shown that to
   attain the aim it is necessary to take into account the spatial
   variability of precipitation, soil moisture and leaf area index. A first
   version of a dynamical-stochastical model which takes into account the
   spatial variability of the aforementioned factors on a regional scale is
   presented. The model allows one to calculate temporal variation of
   statistical parameters of spatial distribution of soil water storage
   (namely, area-averaged value, standard deviation and even function of
   distribution) using the two first statistical moments of initial soil
   water storage, current precipitation and current leaf area index. A
   comparison of simulated and observed values of area averaged water
   storage in the top 1 m soil layer and their spatial variability for the
   Kiev and Kursk regions situated in the forest-steppe zone of the Former
   Soviet Union has demonstrated satisfactory agreement. Analysis of the
   results obtained shows that taking into account the spatial variability
   allows one to :(1) reduce the value of root-mean-square deviation
   between observed and calculated area-average soil water storage from 20
   to 14 mm; (2) obtain the temporal variation of spatial variability of
   soil water storage; (3) draw a conclusion that area-averaged
   evapotranspiration can be overestimated by approximately 7\% without
   accounting for spatial heterogeneity. In addition, it was found that
   current spatial variability of soil water storage is mainly affected by
   current variability of precipitation and leaf area index rather than the
   variability of initial soil water storage. The main contribution (up to
   70-75\%) is made by precipitation in the regions under study. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Soil moisture measurements were performed weekly at about 60 locations
   in a small catchment (6.3 km(2)) in southwest Germany over a period of 6
   years. The measurements were carried out by using time domain
   reflectometry at four different depths. The data was analyzed and a time
   independent semivariogram was derived. For interpolation, five different
   methods, ordinary kriging, external drift kriging, indicator kriging,
   external drift indicator kriging and Bayes-Markov updating were used.
   Additional information such as topographical parameters derived from a
   digital elevation model, were used to improve the estimation in the
   external drift methods. In the Bayesian case, even qualitative
   information such as land use could be used. Depending on the
   assumptions, the interpolated maps differed significantly. The
   performance of the different methods was compared using a
   cross-validation approach. The results indicate improvement in the
   interpolation quality by using the topographic index or land use as
   additional information. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper derives and solves approximate unconditional moment equations
   for a concentration plume in a two-dimensional spatially random
   transmissivity field subject to spatially random recharge and
   non-uniform (linear trending) velocity. Closed-form expressions are
   derived for the unconditional, non-stationary auto-covariances for head
   and velocity, and the cross-covariances between velocity, head,
   recharge, and log transmissivity based on a system of coupled
   first-order partial differential moment equations and assumed hole-type
   input covariance functions for log transmissivity and recharge. The
   unconditional flow related moment equations are incorporated into a
   system of solute transport moment equations, which is solved using a
   Galerkin finite element algorithm. A constant positive mean recharge
   yields a mean velocity gradient, which enhances the ensemble mean plume
   spreading in the longitudinal direction similar to results found by

   variability in recharge further enhances the spreading of the ensemble

   spatial distribution of recharge also increases the extent of the
   ensemble standard deviation plume, particularly in the lateral

   concentration. The uncertainty in the prediction of solute transport
   increases with increasing recharge variance and spatial correlation

Abstract = {{A hydrologic monitoring program was implemented in a nest of watersheds
   within the Kuparuk River basin in northern Alaska as part of an
   interdisciplinary effort to quantify the flux of mass and energy from a
   large arctic area. Described here are characteristics of annual
   hydrographs and individual storm hydrographs of four basins draining
   areas of 0.026 km(2), 2.2 km(2), 142 km(2), and 8140 km(2); an
   assessment of the influence that permafrost has on those
   characteristics; and comparisons to rivers in regions without
   permafrost. Snowmelt runoff dominated the annual runoff in each basin. A
   typical storm hydrograph in the Kuparuk River basin had a fast initial
   response time, long time lags between the hyetograph and hydrograph
   centroids, an extended recession, and a high runoff/precipitation ratio
   due to the diminished storage caused by permafrost. The seemingly
   contradictory results of fast response times and extended recessions can
   be explained by the presence of a large saturated area occupied by
   hillslope water tracks. This saturated area provides a partial-source
   area for fast runoff generation that bypasses the storage capacity of
   organic soils and tundra vegetation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Title = {{A geostatistical framework for incorporating seismic tomography

Abstract = {{A geostatistical approach is presented for the inclusion of seismic
   tomography data and sonic log data into the estimation of hydraulic
   conductivity. The procedure accounts for the errors in seismic
   tomography inversion and for the correlation of such errors, The
   proposed methodology consists of two steps: (1) the cross-variogram
   inference is carried out using only the data at the wellbore (both
   hydraulic and seismic); (2) a co-kriging procedure takes the cross-well
   data into account to interpolate between boreholes. No postulated
   a-priori relationship is needed. In order to illustrate the methodology
   a synthetic data set is generated on the basis of evidence from
   published case studies and simplified physical considerations. The
   numerical experiments show that the choice of the excitation frequency
   is critical. A trade-off exists between the need for a high-resolution
   survey (asking for higher freqencies) and the need for a good
   correlation between hydraulic conductivity and seismic properties
   (asking for frequencies below the squirt frequency of the medium). In
   the simulation using seismic data with the best excitation frequency (1
   kHz in this case), the mean squared error of the hydraulic conductivity
   estimate is two-thirds lower than using hydraulic data alone. It is
   important to note also that only a part of the interwell region is
   adequately sampled by the tomographic experiment, Such a region can be
   readily identified by calculating the energy of the quasi-null space,
   through singular value decomposition of the tomographic matrix, In
   planning this type of experiments, it is necessary to carefully verify
   case by case whether the adopted range of high frequencies does not
   prevent the seismic energy from propagating effectively from sources to
   receivers. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal behaviour of a class A evaporation pan has been studied by
   doing an outdoor experiment and by modelling the energy budget of the
   pan in detail. The observations showed that the temperature of the water
   remains more or less homogeneous throughout the daily cycle. This means
   that the water inside the pan is well mixed. This characteristic thermal
   behaviour was observed even under low wind (u(0.5 m) < 2.0 m s(-1))
   conditions. The one-dimensional model simulations agreed well with the
   experimental evidence. However, in the model simulations corrections had
   to be carried out for the turbulence generated by the pan itself and in
   particular by the rim of the pan. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of hydrogen and oxygen stable-isotope values in
   groundwater can be used to distinguish different sources of recharge and
   to trace groundwater flow directions from recharge boundaries. This
   method can be particularly useful in fractured-rock settings where
   multiple lines of evidence are required to delineate preferential flow
   paths that result from heterogeneity within fracture zones. Flow paths
   delineated with stable isotopes can be combined with hydraulic data to
   form a more complete picture of the groundwater flow system.
   In this study values of delta D and delta(18)O were used to delineate
   paths of river-water infiltration into the Lockport Group, a fractured
   dolomite aquifer, and to compute the percentage of river water in
   groundwater samples from shallow bedrock wells. Flow paths were
   correlated with areas of high hydraulic diffusivity in the shallow
   bedrock that were delineated from water-level fluctuations induced by
   diurnal stage fluctuations in man-made hydraulic structures.
   Flow paths delineated with the stable-isotope and hydraulic data suggest
   that river infiltration reaches an unlined storm sewer in the bedrock
   through a drainage system that surrounds aqueducts carrying river water
   to hydroelectric power plants. This finding is significant because the
   storm sewer is the discharge point for contaminated groundwater from
   several chemical waste-disposal sites and the cost of treating the storm
   sewer's discharge could be reduced if the volume of infiltration from
   the river were decreased. Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{There are only a few basic statistical measures of discrepancy between a
   model and the modelled quantity. All the other quality measures which
   can be called `derivative criteria' are mostly dimensionless functions
   which use a selected basic measure (most often it is the mean squared
   error of a model, MSE) calculated for the model assessed and another
   measure calculated for a reference model. For this reason these criteria
   are interrelated, which is not always sufficiently realized. It is shown
   that MSE depends on the correlation coefficient between observed and
   computed values R, another popular measure of model performance. Other
   often employed criteria: the integral squared error ISE, the special
   correlation coefficient R-s, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency E are also
   interdependent as they are all based on MSE. Thus, when employing two or
   more criteria at once, special care should be taken in order not to draw
   contradictory conclusions, examples of which are given in the paper. (C)

Abstract = {{The water use strategy of Eucalyptus largiflorens (F. Muell.) was
   investigated in response to flooding on the Chowilla Anabranch, a
   semi-arid floodplain of the Murray River, South Australia. Water use was
   measured using the heat pulse technique at six sites that varied in
   flood duration from 0 to 78 days. Soil chloride, plant water potential
   and surface root mass were also measured. Suppression of tree water use
   did not occur during flooding regardless of flood length and site
   health, suggesting that sufficient oxygen had been available to the
   trees. Increases in tree water use occurred at some sites after the
   flood because of increases in water availability due to leaching of salt
   from the soil profile. The soils with a higher clay content incurred
   little leaching of salts and therefore little change in tree water
   availability. In contrast, the sites with more sandy soils encountered
   greater leaching and greater increases in tree water availability.
   Despite differing soil type responses, all tree communities investigated
   showed a reduction in tree water stress in the period after flooding.
   These findings suggest that flooding in this environment improves the
   health of Eucalyptus largiflorens in the short-term. The implications of
   these findings are discussed with regard to the management of the
   Chowilla Anabranch. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. An rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A general formula for the rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (idf)
   relationship, consistent with the theoretical probabilistic foundation
   of the analysis of rainfall maxima is proposed. Specific forms of this
   formula are explicitly derived from the underlying probability
   distribution function of maximum intensities. Several appropriate
   distribution functions are studied for that purpose. Simple analytical
   approximations of the most common distribution functions are presented,
   which are incorporated in, and allow mathematically convenient
   expressions of idf relationships. Also, two methods for a reliable
   parameter estimation of idf relationships are proposed. The proposed
   formulation of idf relationships constitutes an efficient
   parameterisation, facilitating the description of the geographical
   variability and regionalisation of idf curves. Moreover, it allows
   incorporating data from non-recording stations, thus remedying the
   problem of establishing idf curves in places with a sparse network of
   rain-recording stations, using data of the denser network of
   non-recording stations. Case studies, based on data of a significant
   part of Greece, briefly presented in the paper, clarify the methodology
   for the construction and regionalisation of the idf relationship. (C)

Abstract = {{Prediction of unsaturated how phenomena at field-scale requires a set of
   hydraulic functions that capture local-scale variability which is
   present in all natural soils. Several sets of hydraulic functions
   measured on different core sizes collected across the field were used to
   predict drainage from a saturated soil profile. Simulations were carried
   out with a one-dimensional numerical model, based on the Richards
   equation. Four methods were considered: (1) Monte-Carlo simulation using
   500 unimodal retention and conductivity functions representing
   theta(psi) and K-S data measured on 0.05 m diameter 0.051 m long core
   samples; (2) multiple simulations with a set of 60 multimodal retention
   and conductivity functions which better represented the measured
   theta(psi) data of method 1; (3) one single simulation with a set of
   hydraulic functions obtained from a gravity-drainage experiment on 15 l
   m long 0.3 m diameter soil columns collected from the same field; (4)
   one single simulation with a set of hydraulic functions obtained by
   scaling the retention and conductivity data from method 3. A perfect
   match of the final mean outflow was obtained when scaled retention data
   was used in combination with scaled K-S values (method 4). All other
   cases underestimated the total outflow to a varying degree: 30\% for
   method 1, 29\% for method 2, and 21\% for method 3. The results further
   revealed that none of the four methods was able to completely describe
   the mean observed drainage from the start until the equilibrium
   condition. This was further demonstrated by the disparities between the
   mean observed soil water content profile and the simulated values using
   hydraulic functions from method 4. Especially after the first day,
   differences were large, presumably because macropore flow could not be
   described using the Richards flow equation.
   Despite the introduction of multimodal retention and conductivity
   functions which better described the retention behaviour of small soil
   cores (method 2) in comparison with unimodal retention functions (method
   1), mean predicted outflow for both methods was nearly identical. (C)

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to identify and assess long-term impacts
   of land use change on catchment runoff in semi-arid Zimbabwe, based on
   analyses of long hydrological time series (25-50 years) from six
   medium-sized (200-1000 km(2)) non-experimental rural catchments. A
   methodology combining common statistical methods with hydrological
   modelling was adopted in order to distinguish between the effects of
   climate variability and the effects of land use change. The hydrological
   model (NAM) was in general able to simulate the observed hydrographs
   very well during the reference period, thus providing a means to account
   for the effects of climate variability and hence strengthening the power
   of the subsequent statistical tests. In the test period the validated
   model was used to provide the runoff record which would have occurred in
   the absence of land use change. The analyses indicated a decrease in the
   annual runoff for most of the six catchments, with the largest changes
   occurring for catchments located within communal land, where large
   increases in population and agricultural intensity have taken place.
   However, the decrease was only statistically significant at the 5\%
   level for one of the catchments. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   evaporation, net radiation and soil moisture are in good agreement with
   field observations, catchment water balance data, and atmospheric water
   budget analysis; explained variances being greater than 75\%.

Abstract = {{A process-based biophysical model of evaporation described previously
   was run using spatially representative data to calculate global fields
   of monthly total transpiration, soil evaporation and interception for a
   period of 24 months (January 1987 to December 1988). Solution of the
   energy balance equation provided net radiation and sensible heat flux,
   complementing the evaporative flux. The zonally averaged (area weighted
   5 degrees latitude bands) values of annual total evaporation and
   evaporative fraction (ratio of evaporation and net radiation) are in
   broad agreement with previous estimates. Transpiration was found to be
   the dominant component of annual total evaporation in 20 out of the 28
   latitude bands. partitioning of annual total evaporation over the global
   land area is calculated to be, 52\% transpiration, 28\% soil evaporation
   and 20\% interception. Seasonal variations of total evaporation and its
   components are presented for some specific types of vegetation (e.g.,
   tundra, taiga, rainforest, crop land) and compared with field
   observations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The planning and design of a water resources project demands accurate
   hydrological information. Accurate and reliable regional hydrological
   information not only reduces the chances of project failure but also
   minimizes the economic risk. Therefore, it is imperative that a
   hydrological network be planned and designed scientifically. The
   criterion for hydrological network design should be the optimum number
   of stations and their respective locations by which hydrological
   information can be maximized. In this paper, a hydrological network
   design method, based on Shannon's Information Measure, was applied to
   the existing hydrological network in hydrological Area III, located in
   the south-western region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to examine
   their suitability towards providing maximum hydrological information.
   The study shows that the existing seventy rainfall stations can be
   reduced to approximately 45 including stations at new sites. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that correlation and spectral
   analyses can contribute to the regional study of a large karst aquifer.
   An example is presented for the La Rochefoucauld karst aquifer
   (Charente, France). Different types of spatially distributed time series
   provide valuable spatio-temporal information for the karat aquifer. The
   available time series consist of the spring flow rates, the flow rates
   at different locations in sinking streams, the piezometric levels, the
   electrical conductivity and temperature of the water, the atmospheric
   pressure and the precipitation The analysis of the flow rates at the
   springs shows that the aquifer empties very slowly and has a large
   storage capacity. Hydrodynamic links were established between three of
   the four rivers flowing on the aquifer and the springs. The results also
   demonstrate the important spatial heterogeneity of the aquifer and
   indicate that the most rapid flow occurs in the northern part of the
   aquifer. Hourly piezometric and electrical conductivity time series
   indicate that the transmissivity of the aquifer varies when some
   conductive channels become desaturated during the low water period. The
   delays between the distributed recharge and the piezometric level,
   between the localized river input and the how rates at the springs and
   between the electrical conductivities in rivers and the main spring
   provide information on the travel times in the aquifer, The observation
   of earth tides and barometric effects indicate that this apparently
   unconfined aquifer has a confined behaviour. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Modelling solute transport in the unsaturated zone is a complex problem
   given the inherent soil heterogeneity. Using time domain reflectometry
   (TDR) as described in this paper can improve data quality to be used in
   predictive models. The TDR technique requires appropriate calibration if
   it is to be used for solute concentration measurements under constant
   and varying water content. Two ways of determining the parameters in the
   relationship between bulk soil electrical conductivity, sigma(a), soil
   solution electrical conductivity, sigma(w), and volumetric water
   content, theta, were used. Among the two calibration methods tested
   here, the one which involved eluting the soil with several pore volumes
   of water of known electrical conductivity under transient flow
   conditions in an undisturbed soil column gave a linear
   sigma(w)-sigma(a)-theta relationship with depth dependent parameters.
   The other calibration method involved the use of disturbed soil under
   static conditions and resulted in a curvilinear sigma(w)-sigma(a)-theta
   relationship. The former calibration was subsequently used to determine
   solute concentrations in breakthrough experiments. Two solute transport
   experiments were carried out in the same undisturbed soil column; one
   for steady-state and one for transient flow condition. Parameters of the
   convective log normal transfer function (CLT) model were determined
   using time-integral-normalized resident concentrations. It was shown
   that the stochastic-convective approach described the experimental data
   well. Horizontal heterogeneity was mon important during the transient
   experiment, where the topsoil was periodically ponded during a short
   period, than in the steady-state experiment, where unsaturated
   conditions were maintained throughout the experiment. This increased
   heterogeneity during transient flow was also reflected by the fact that
   preferential solute flow was only observed in the column's outlet under
   transient conditions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Natural variations in concentrations of O-18, D, and H4SiO4 in two
   tributary catchments of Woods Lake in the west-central Adirondack
   Mountains of New York were measured during 1989-91 to examine runoff
   processes and their implications for the neutralization of acidic
   precipitation by calcium carbonate treatment. The two catchments are
   similar except that one contained a 1.3 ha beaver pond. Evaporation from
   the beaver pond caused a seasonal decrease in the slope of the meteoric
   water line in stream water from the catchment with a beaver pond (WO2).
   No corresponding change in slope of the meteoric water line was evident
   in stream water from the other catchment (WO4), nor in ground water nor
   soil water from either catchment, indicating that evaporative
   fractionation was not significant. Application of a best-fit sine curve
   to delta(18)O data indicated that base how in both catchments had a
   residence time of about 100 days, Ground water from a well finished in
   thick till had the longest residence time (160 days); soil water from
   the O-horizon and B-horizon had residence times of 63 and 80 days,
   respectively. Water previously stored within each catchment (pre-event
   water) was the predominant component of streamflow during spring
   snowmelt and during spring and autumn rainfall events, but the
   proportion of streamflow that consisted of pre-event water differed
   significantly in the two catchments. The proportion of event water (rain
   and snowmelt) in WO2 was smaller than at WO4 early in the spring
   snowmelt of March 13-17, 1990, but the proportions of source water
   components for the two catchments were almost indistinguishable by the
   peak flow on the third day of the melt. The event water was further
   separated into surface-water and subsurface-water components by
   utilizing measured changes in H4SiO4 concentrations in stream water
   during the snowmelt. Results indicated that subsurface flow was the
   dominant pathway by which event water reached the stream except during
   the peak flow of a rain-on-snow event on the last day of the melt.
   Streamflow from a spring rain storm with dry antecedent conditions two
   months later (May 16-18, 1990), was less than 5\% event water at peak
   flow in WO2 and 26\% in WO4. This change from the runoff pattern in
   March is attributed to retention of event water in the beaver pond
   favored by relatively low pre-event storage and isothermal
   (nonstratified) conditions in the pond that allowed mixing. Streamflow
   during several autumn storms was about 15-25\% event water at peak flow
   in WO4; the highest values for event water were associated with wet
   antecedent moisture conditions. These results indicate that a beaver
   pond can significantly affect the downstream delivery of event water
   through evaporation and mixing, but provides minimal retention during
   large runoff events such as snowmelt. Beaver ponds are expected to
   provide greater opportunity for neutralization of acidic waters during
   most of the year in catchments treated with calcium carbonate, but
   little neutralization effect during snowmelt. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Seasonal concentrations and delta(13)C of dissolved inorganic carbon
   (DIC) in a river-tributary system in Kalamazoo, southwest Michigan, USA,
   have been measured using a modified gas evolution technique. The
   technique makes use of evacuated glass septum tubes pre-loaded with
   phosphoric acid and a magnetic stir bar. Water samples are injected into
   these septum tubes in the field, which eliminates problems associated
   with CO2 loss/gain during sample storage and transfer to the vacuum line
   during DIC extraction. Using this technique, a precision of 1\% and 0.1
   parts per thousand can be achieved for DIC concentrations and
   delta(13)C(DIC) measurements, respectively. As this technique provides
   reliable measurements of DIC concentrations and carbon isotope ratios,
   it was used to evaluate the processes that control DIC in the
   river-tributary system.
   Results of DIC concentration and delta(13)C(DIC) measurements of water
   samples from the river-tributary system show that the DIC pool is mostly
   dominated by groundwater. The DIC concentrations and delta(13)C(DIC) are
   within the ranges measured for the most isotopically evolved groundwater
   in this region. Seasonal variations superimposed on the baseline values
   are attributed to secondary processes such as CO2 invasion from the
   atmosphere, enhanced recharge from lakes and biological activities of
   photosynthesis, respiration, and decay. With the onset of spring, there
   is a concurrent increase in the DIC concentration and delta(13)C(DIC) Of
   these streams. A simultaneous increase in concentration and C-13
   enrichment of the riverine DIC pool is consistent with CO2 invasion and
   recharge from lakes. During the summer, biological activity is the
   predominant control on shifts in the DIC pool. Although photosynthesis,
   respiration and decay occur during this time, decreases in the DIC
   concentration and increases in the delta(13)C(DIC) indicates CO2 removal
   from the pool by photosynthesis. In the late summer-early fall,
   photosynthesis declines and respiration and decay cause an increase in
   the DIC concentration and a decreases in the delta(13)C(DIC). When
   biological activity decreases significantly during the late fall and
   winter months, the river and most of its tributaries approach a baseline
   DIC concentration and delta(13)C(DIC) Similar to that of isotopically
   fully evolved groundwater in the Kalamazoo area. Although this holds
   true for tributaries and the main river, the timing and magnitude of
   shifts from background DIC is different for individual streams. The
   magnitude of shifts in the DIC concentration and delta(13)C(DIC) is most
   pronounced in tributary streams because of the short residence time of
   water in these streams. This study shows that DIC concentration and
   delta(13)C(DIC) measurements can be successfully used to evaluate the
   timing and dominance of the major processes that influence DIC in a
   riverine system. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Total forest evaporation, E, understorey evaporation, E-u, and
   environmental variables were measured for 18 consecutive mid-summer days
   during July 1996 in a 215-year-old stand of Pious sylvestris L. trees
   located 40 km southwest of the village of Zotino in central siberia,
   Russia (61 degrees N, 89 degrees E, 160 m asl). Tree and lichen
   (Cladonia and Cladina spp.) understorey one sided leaf and surface-area
   indices were 1.5 and 6.0, respectively. Daily E, measured by eddy
   covariance, was 0.8-2.3 mm day(-1) which accounted for 15-67\% of the
   available energy, R-a. Following 12 mm rainfall, daily E reached a
   maximum on the second day (the first clear day) but declined rapidly
   thereafter to reach minimum rates within one week. The sandy soil had a
   range of water content equivalent to only 4 mm water per 100 mm depth of
   soil. It was estimated that 38\% of soil water was utilised before water
   deficit began to limit E. E-u, also measured by eddy covariance and by
   lysimeters, was 0.5 to 1.6 mm day(-1) or 33-92\% of E. E-u was
   proportional to R-a, but in response to soil drying, the slope of this
   linear relation declined by a factor of three to a minimum value only
   three days after the rainfall. Based on the measurements and
   climatological data, including average annual precipitation of 600 mm
   year(-1) with half as rain during the nominal growing season (1 May to
   30 September), water balance calculations suggested E was 265 mm per
   growing season. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Empirical relationships between daily hydrometeorological variables for
   a catchment in Nagano prefecture, Japan and three indices of regional
   atmospheric circulation are examined with a view to assessing their use
   in General Circulation Model (GCM) downscaling. The indices (vorticity,
   flow strength and angular direction of airflow) were calculated by using
   daily grid-point sea-level pressure data derived from: (a) the National
   Centers for Environmental Prediction, NCEP Re-analysis data set
   (1979-1995); and (b) the UK Meteorological Office, Hadley Centre coupled
   ocean-atmosphere model (HadCM2SUL) for two periods indicative of present
   (1980-1999) and future greenhouse gas plus sulfate aerosol forcing
   (2080-2099). Statistical models of the surface variables were then
   ``forced{''} by using the three airflow indices obtained from HadCM2SUL.
   The differences between the NCEP and HadCM2SUL ``present{''} downscaled
   variables were generally greater than those arising between the
   downscaling of the two GCM airflow scenarios. The lack of change in
   downscaled surface variables between the 1980-1999 and 2080-2099 data
   was attributed to the low sensitivity of atmospheric circulation
   patterns in HadCM2SUL to greenhouse gas forcing. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Spatial soil moisture patterns have been measured in the 10.5 ha
   Tarrawarra catchment in temperate south-eastern Australia on 13
   occasions using time domain reflectometry (TDR). Measurements are made
   on regular grids of between 500 and 2000 points for each occasion. The
   spatial correlation structure of these soil moisture patterns is
   analysed. Sample variograms are found to have a clear sill and a nugget.
   Exponential variogram models, including a nugget, fit the sample
   variograms closely. The geostatistical structure is found to evolve
   seasonally. High sills (5-25 (\% v/v)(2)) and low col relation lengths
   (35-50 m) are observed during the wet winter period. During the dry
   summer period sills an smaller (5-15 (\%v/v)(2)) and correlation lengths
   are longer (50-60 m). This seasonal evolution is explained on the basis
   of the importance of lateral redistribution of moisture during different
   seasons. Both a nugget effect due to measurement error and variability
   at small scales contribute to the variability at the 10 m scale, which
   is the smallest scale in most of the data sets, For one occasion four
   soil moisture patterns containing 514 samples were collected on 10 x 20
   m grids. These patterns are offset by 2 m in an easterly and/or a
   northerly direction. Variograms for these four patterns are similar
   which indicates that variograms used for the structural analysis are
   highly reliable. An analysis based on transects subsampled from typical
   summer and winter soil moisture patterns indicates that a substantial
   number of data points (more than about 300) are needed to obtain
   meaningful sample variograms. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews various approximation methods for evaluating one form
   of the exponential integral known as the Theis well function W(u) and
   presents an algorithm that can be easily implemented to one's desired
   accuracy for 0 < u < infinity. The algorithm is based on a combination
   of a fast-converging series representation for small u and an
   easy-implementing Gauss-Laguerre quadrature formula when 21 becomes
   large. The partition point for Ir varies with the desired program
   accuracy and efficiency. The error analyses suggested that a partition
   point in the interval of 1 less than or equal to u less than or equal to
   4 can yield sufficiently accurate results for practical applications of
   groundwater problems with minimum computational effort. A comparison of
   the results revealed that the popular Stehfest inverse Laplace transform
   technique generally yielded a relative error several orders of magnitude
   greater than that obtained by the proposed algorithm. For large u, the
   approximation accuracy increased rapidly using the quadrature formula
   while the results of the Laplace inversion technique showed numerical
   oscillation between some positive and negative values. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The specification of environmental water requirements in rivers requires
   the ability to relate discharge to local hydraulic conditions. Rating
   curves at locations of interest are a basic requirement. but are
   difficult and time-consuming to compile using conventional methods.
   River stage can be monitored relatively easily and can be related to
   discharge monitored at a different location on the same river by flood
   routing techniques. Simultaneous short-term records of local stage and
   remote discharge can be used through a nonlinear Muskingum model to
   optimize the parameters of a rating function at the local site. The
   approach is verified by resynthesizing a rating function used in
   rigorous routing in a hypothetical channel, and applied to a monitored
   site on the Sable River in South Africa, with account taken of dynamic
   bank storage. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Inflows to South Island, New Zealand lakes deriving from snowmelt are
   quantified using a water balance approach and are shown to be between
   8\% and 24\% of annual inflow. A snow accumulation index calculated from
   climatological data using a snowpack simulation model confirms the
   general pattern of the year-to-year variability of these estimates.
   Previous work has shown that summer inflows tend to be relatively low in
   years when the EI Nino Southern Oscillation phenomenon is in a positive
   phase (i.e. La Nina). We show that this pattern is also evident in
   records of precipitation around the catchments, particularly where
   precipitation exceeds 1000 mm/yr. Variance of inflows and precipitation
   appears to be dependent on the magnitude of the SOI.
   Snowmelt increases somewhat in La Nina years, and this may relate to a
   general trend for wanner temperatures in these years.
   A relative absence of La Nina conditions for 1976-1994 may be partially
   responsible for a significant increase in mean lake inflows over the
   period 1978-1994. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Assessments of average annual precipitation (AAP) are necessary for
   hydrological studies of a watershed for various water resources
   activities. Although AAP isohyetal maps provide global information, the
   behavior of precipitation occurrence al and around any individual
   station cannot be assessed from such maps. For this purpose, the point
   cumulative semivariogram (PCSV) concept is presented and applied to
   precipitation records from Yucca Mountain, NV, USA. These PCSVs provide
   qualitative interpretations that are subsequently convertible to simple
   quantitative relationships for predictions. Further, PCSV provides
   information about the nugget effect, radius of influence, structural
   changes etc. within the regional variations in the precipitation event
   around each station. The application revealed that Yucca Mountain annual
   precipitation amounts are not regionally homogeneous but have three
   distinctive types of homogeneity subregions. In the first category there
   is no nugget effect in the regional precipitation around the site
   concerned whereas there is significant regional dependence at small
   distances from the site. The second category includes a rather perfect
   regional relationship around the station concerned up to a certain
   distance and then onwards there is an abrupt region of independence.
   Finally, the last category implies that the precipitation amount at a
   station accumulates due to local convective rainfall events. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Groundwater recharge must be well understood in order that water
   resources can be effectively used and contamination of groundwater by
   surface water can be prevented. Evaluating recharge from groundwater
   levels alone does not show downward flow when outflow exceeds recharge.
   This article showed the variation of Rn-222 concentrations in soil water
   according to degree of saturation in the aquifer. The theory used for
   analysis is based on gas solubility theory between two phases, liquid
   and gas.
   Field investigation confirmed that Rn-222 concentration in the
   groundwater at the surface of a saturated zone decreases with downward
   flow in the unsaturated zone above. After that, we investigated the
   recharge by paddy fields with the method using Rn-222 concentration in
   the groundwater at the surface of a saturated zone. The results showed
   that the state of recharge could be analyzed as expected, i.e., the
   occurrence of downward flow of soil water pushed out by irrigation
   water, unsaturated percolation during the irrigation period, and the
   redistribution of soil water after the release of pending water. The
   degree of saturation of downward flow in the unsaturated zone was
   calculated to be about 50\% from the ratio of Rn-222 concentration in
   the irrigation period to that in the non-irrigation period. This shows
   that the downward flow in the underlying layer was very unsaturated.
   When the groundwater table is deep, and less pervious soil overlies more
   pervious soil, it is known that percolation from paddy fields is
   unsaturated in the underlying layer. Since the saturated hydraulic
   conductivity of the underlying layer was on the order of 10(-1) cm/s and
   that of surface soil is 10(-5) to 10(-6) cm/s, it is likely that
   unsaturated downward flow occurred. The Rn-222 concentration in the
   groundwater at the surface of a saturated zone is a useful indicator for
   detecting the existence of downward flow to the saturated zone through
   an unsaturated aquifer. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The propagation of stage rises of the river Danube in an adjoining
   alluvial aquifer (Kisalfold, NW Hungary) has been studied by preparing a
   map which shows the lag times corresponding to maximum correlation
   values between the hydrographs of groundwater observation wells and the
   river stages. As expected, the lag times for the unconfined aquifer
   generally exceed those for the semi-confined part. The complex pattern
   suggests that other rivers in the area also play a role and that
   transmissivities and resistances of a cover layer are not sufficiently
   well known, despite the presence of a relatively dense network of bore
   holes. A systematic increase of the lag times with the distance from the
   river was noted at two sections. Nine flood events have been selected to
   study how well observed head rises could be predicted using equations
   for the calculation of the propagation of the head for phreatic and for
   confined conditions. The results suggest that the water levels in the
   complex flood plain and the river bed conductance of silted up branches
   during the rise of the flood play an important role. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Alpha-recoil is an important way for the mobilization of cu-decay
   daughters in ground water. The processes of decay and recoil from U-238
   to Rn-222 and from Th-232 to Rn-220 ate successive. The release rates of
   successive recoils in this study are quantitatively estimated under two
   extreme conditions: complete adsorption: and no adsorption of recoil
   elements by the porous medium. The recoil probability, recoil embedding
   and effective surface area are considered during the analysis. The
   result of this study shows that the recoil supply rates in the porous
   medium decrease down the decay chains. For the isotopes within the same
   decay chains. recoil emanation ratios of daughters to parents are
   usually greater than I under both end member conditions. This is
   consistent with the higher daughter to parent ratios observed in the
   field measurements. It is also found that the emanation ratios of Th. Ra
   and Rn show little change with the change of porosity in general. Radon
   emanation is most efficient at 15-20\% porosity under the condition of
   complete adsorption. The calculated radioactivity ratios of daughters to
   parents from this study can provide a partial explanation for the
   disequilibrium of radioactivity of daughters relative to parents
   observed in natural water. Because of the low solubility of thorium,
   radium and radon, the emanation rates calculated under the condition of
   complete adsorption are closer to the natural conditions. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{In karst aquifers, water moves from the recharge area (sinkhole plains
   and swallets) to the discharge area (springs), traveling kilometers
   through the groundwater system in a period of hems to days. Transit
   rimes through karst aquifers are a function of the conduit geometry and
   connectedness, intensity and duration of the recharge event, and
   antecedent soil moisture. Often many of these factors are unknown or
   difficult to quantify. Therefore, predicting the response of a karst
   basin to recharge is difficult. Numerous researchers have attempted to
   understand the response of a karst basin, but a good understanding of
   whether the response is dependent on local features or regional effects
   is currently lacking.
   From April 1994 to May 1995, flood pulse hydrographs from a karst
   aquifer with well-developed and well-documented conduits (Devil's Icebox
   cave system) were obtained from a gaging station near the spring of the
   karst basin. Data were also collected from within the conduit system in
   an attempt to determine whether flow was locally controlled by
   constrictions in the conduits. Based on an application of Bernoulli's
   equation, analyses of the changes in kinetic head and potential head
   over time indicated local control during storm events. The observed
   sediment patterns and water level variations also support localized flow
   control during storm events.
   A numerical model of the constrictions was rested and reproduced the
   responses observed at the spring during initial periods of storm events.
   The model illustrated that the constricted flow was very sensitive to
   recharge. It also illustrated the transition from local control due to
   constriction to regional controls due to the aquifer matrix. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to study the variation of evaporation in
   time and space. A two-layer model for solving energy and water balance
   is presented. The vertical soil column between the soil surface and the
   water table is divided into the root zone and the transmission zone. The
   variable infiltration capacity (VIC) concept is used to introduce a
   spatially varied distribution of soil moisture in the root zone layer,
   The soil moisture is distributed uniformly in space in the transmission
   zone layer. The model is used to simulate the fluxes for the King's
   Creek catchment in Manhattan, Kansas for a period between June through
   October 1987 (for the four intensive field campaigns), during which the
   first ISLSCP (International Satelite Land Surface Climatology Project)
   field experiment (FIFE) was conducted, The model is calibrated using the
   observed data during the first intensive field campaign (IFC) and
   validated over the next three IFCS, The energy and water balance
   equations are solved to vield the time series of fluxes which are
   compared to their observed counterparts. The model predicted diurnal
   variation of the evaporative fluxes and the variation of the fluxes
   after rainfall events is compared with the observations. The model
   computed fluxes match fairly well with the observed fluxes. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{A model which couples the kinematic wave approximation for Hortonian
   overland flow and the conceptual approach developed by; Corradini er
   cri. (1997) {[}J. Hydrol., 192, 104-124] For local infiltration was used
   to investigate the effects of random spatial variability of saturated
   hydraulic conductivity, K-s, on the outflow hydrograph at hillslope
   scale. The model incorporates a representation of infiltration of
   overland flow running over pervious downstream areas ({''}run-on{''}
   process). Single rainfall pulses and complex storms over two soils.
   representative of a silty loam and a sandy loam soil, were considered.
   Our results suggest that for realistic values of the coefficient of
   variation of K-s, the nln-on process cannot be disregarded, because it
   produces a significant decrease of overland flow during both the rising
   and the recession limb of the hydrograph. Furthermore, the role of the
   level of spatial correlation of K-s was found to be typically minor and
   the run-on process concurred to this result. The possibility of
   simplifying the stochastic problem by a deterministic approach based on
   the use of a uniform lumped value of K-s was also examined and rainfall
   patterns adequate for this simplification were deduced in terms of
   scaled storm intensity and storm duration. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Discharge from a spring draining a small, perched. Cretaceous chalk
   aquifer in the Upper Galilee, Israel, was monitored over a period of two
   years. The water has elevated nitrate concentrations, with N-15/N-14 and
   chemical data suggesting that it is a mixture of low-nitrate and
   high-nitrate end-members; the Latter derived from the sewage of a
   centuries-old village served by septic tanks. Hydrograph data allowed
   distinction between fissure flow during the period of winter rainfall,
   and matrix drainage during the dry summer months. These different flow
   types, however, did not have markedly different nitrate concentrations:
   a 50-fold increase in spring discharge due to fissure flow, compared
   with matrix drainage, was reflected in only a 35\% decrease in nitrate
   concentrations, The relatively high nitrate concentrations in the
   fissure waters suggests that they have had close contact with, and are
   possibly displaced from the matrix. This should help to accelerate the
   decline in the spring's nitrate concentrations following the recent
   completion of the village's central sewage drainage system. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The development of automated (computer-based) calibration methods has
   focused mainly on the selection of a single-objective measure of the
   distance between the model-simulated output and the data and the
   selection of an automatic optimization algorithm to search for the
   parameter values which minimize that distance. However, practical
   experience with model calibration suggests that no single-objective
   function is adequate to measure the ways in which the model fails to
   match the important characteristics of the observed data. Given that
   some of the latest hydrologic models simulate several of the watershed
   output fluxes (e.g. water, energy, chemical constituents, etc.), there
   is a need for effective and efficient multiobjective calibration
   procedures capable of exploiting all of the useful information about the
   physical system contained in the measurement data time series. The
   MOCOM-UA algorithm, an effective and efficient methodology for solving
   the multiple-objective global optimization problem, is presented in this
   paper. The method is an extension of the successful SCE-UA
   single-objective global optimization algorithm. The features and
   capabilities of MOCOM-UA are illustrated by means of a simple hydrologic
   model calibration study. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Fractal scaling laws of water transport were Found For soils. A water
   transport model is needed to describe this type of transport in soils.
   We have developed a water transport equation using the physical model of
   percolation clusters, employing the mass conservation law, and assuming
   that hydraulic conductivity is a product of a focal component dependent
   on water content and a scaling component depending on the distance
   traveled. The model predicts scaling of water contents with a variable
   x/t(1/(2+beta)) where beta deviates from the zero value characteristic
   for the Richards equation. A change in the apparent water diffusivity
   with the distance is predicted if the apparent diffusivity is calculated
   using the Richards equation. An equation for the time and space
   invariant soil water diffusivity is obtained. Published data sets of
   five authors were used to test the scaling properties predicted by the
   model. The value of beta was significantly greater than zero in almost
   all data sets and typically was in the range from 0.05 to 0.5. This
   exponent was found from regression equations that had correlation
   coefficients From 0.97 to 0.995. In some cases a dependence of beta on
   water content was found indicating changes in scaling as the water
   transport progressed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Several catchment models simplify flow to being a topographically
   driven, one-dimensional process. Under certain conditions analytical
   solutions to the governing flow equation can be derived. However, for
   most hillslopes aquifers, the transmissivity varies with topography and,
   for unconfined problems, through time. In addition, recharge rates are
   also functions of time and position. For these conditions analytical
   solutions for groundwater flow are difficult to derive. In this article
   a quasi-analytical solution procedure is presented which offers a number
   of advantages over existing analytical and numerical solutions to
   groundwater flow in unconfined, one-dimensional, hillslope aquifers. The
   method is based on dividing the problem domain into elements and
   assuming parameter values within the elements are constant. In Laplace
   transform space a simple analytical solution to a constant coefficient
   form of the governing groundwater flow equation can be derived. This
   analytical solution is used as an element ``basis function{''}; each
   element equation coupled together by conditions an mass and dependent
   variable continuity. Time stepping can be introduced to account for
   transient parameter variation. The method is similar in some respects to
   the Laplace transform/finite analytic procedure, but avoids overlapping
   elements and parameter definitions. The developed method is applied to
   four hypothetical problems for groundwater movement in a one-dimensional
   hillslope and results are compared with finite element analyses. The
   method is shown to be able to include spatial and temporal variations of
   parameters in a format that offers highly accurate solutions and
   computational efficiency. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Gravitational loading or unloading due to deposition or erosion in
   sedimentary basins is one of the most common mechanisms responsible for
   abnormal fluid pressures in geologic formations. This paper examines the
   integrated response of fluid pressures to both deposition and erosion
   using vertical one-dimensional numerical models. The modeling results
   show that vertical loading and unloading of sedimentary basins
   containing thick interbeds of low permeability can give rise to abnormal
   fluid pressure-depth trends that closely resemble those observed in the
   field. On a geological time scale, an under-pressured formation may
   become normally pressured or over-pressured and vice versa because of
   transient flow induced by vertical geologic movements. A case study in
   the Guymon area of Texas County, Oklahoma, shows that there are two
   underpressured reservoirs in this area. The burial curve constructed
   from geologic information indicates that this area has undergone
   multiple subsidence and uplift events. Based on stratigraphic
   information, a vertical geologic section of this area is represented by
   a numerical model consisting of two reservoir formations and two shale
   (confining) units. The numerical model is able to reproduce the observed
   pressure abnormalities based on the drill-stem test (DST) data. The
   hydraulic conductivities of the two shale formations are estimated to be
   4.2 x 10(-14) and 5.1 x 10(-14) m s(-1) from model calibration. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has been linked to climate anomalies
   throughout the world. This paper presents an overview of the
   relationship between ENSO and rainfall, drought and streamflow in
   Australia. The teleconnection between ENSO and the hydroclimate of
   Australia is investigated using the empirical method of Ropelewski and
   Halpert and the potential for forecasting the hydroclimate variables are
   investigated by assessing the lag correlations between rainfall and
   streamflow and the indicators of ENSO several months earlier. The
   analyses show that dry conditions in Australia tend to be associated
   with El Nine. The link between rainfall and streamflow and ENSO is
   statistically significant in most parts of Australia, but it is not
   sufficiently strong to consistently predict rainfall and streamflow
   accurately. The teleconnection is stronger in the latter part of the
   year, and the analyses suggest that the indicators of ENSO can be used
   with some success to forecast spring rainfall in eastern Australia and
   summer rainfall in north-east Australia several months in advance. The
   ENSO indicators can also be used to help forecast spring runoff in
   south-east Australia and summer runoff in the north-east and east coasts
   of Australia. Unlike rainfall, the serial correlation in the streamflow
   data is generally similar or higher than the lag streamflow-ENSO
   correlation, and it must be used together with the ENSO indicators in
   developing streamflow forecast models. The seasonal forecasts of
   rainfall and streamflow are invaluable to the management of land and
   water resources, particularly in Australia, where the streamflow
   variability is higher than in most parts of the world. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Current approaches to constructing catchment
   intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves are dominated by the use of
   empirically-derived areal reduction factors (ARFs). In this paper we
   present an alternative methodology which is based on the spatial
   correlation structure of rainfall. It represents an attempt to link
   current scientific theories of space-time rainfall fields with design
   methods. The starting point is to derive the parent distribution of
   catchment average rainfall intensity from that of point rainfall
   intensity. The parameters of the two parent distributions are related
   through a variance reduction factor which is a function of the spatial
   correlation structure of rainfall and catchment area. Assuming that the
   parent distribution is of the `exponential type', it is then transformed
   to an extreme value distribution of the Gumbel type. The crucial step is
   to match the parameters of the extreme rainfall distribution derived
   above, for the particular case of zero catchment area, with those of
   empirical point IDF curves which have also been fitted to the Gumbel
   distribution. With this match, the proposed theory then naturally
   generalises to yield catchment IDF curves for catchments of any size,
   and for rainfall of any spatial correlation structure. The new catchment
   IDF curves have the attractive property that, with a minimum number of
   assumptions, they can reproduce a range of observed properties of
   catchment rainfall. For example, not only the mean and the standard
   deviation of extreme rainfall, but also its coefficient of variation,
   decrease with increasing catchment area. We also find that computed ARFs
   using the new approach depend not only on catchment area and storm
   duration, but also on the return period. We estimate ARFs using the new
   methodology for two major observed storms in Austria, and find that
   these estimates compare favourably with our understanding of the
   rainfall generating mechanisms associated with these two particular
   storm types. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

   analysed to examine its chaotic characteristics. Three schemes, moving
   average, low-pass filter and nonlinear smoothing, were used to reduce

   space trajectory, the largest Lyapunov exponent and correlation
   dimension - were then examined.
   No significant signs of chaotic behaviour were found for either the
   noise-reduced SOI time series or the raw one. Although it contains
   long-term periodicity, the SOI time series is considered to be
   stochastic rather than chaotic from the viewpoint of dynamical systems

Abstract = {{One of the commonly used tools for detecting changes in climatic and
   hydrologic time series is trend analysis. A number of statistical tests
   exist to assess the significance of trends in time series. One of the
   commonly used non-parametric trend tests is the Mann-Kendall trend test.
   The null hypothesis in the Mann-Kendall lest is that the data are
   independent and randomly ordered. However, the existence of positive
   autocorrelation in the data increases the probability of detecting
   trends when actually none exist, and vice versa. Although this is a
   well-known fact, few studies have addressed this issue, and
   autocorrelation in the data is often ignored. In this study, the effect
   of autocorrelation on the variance of the Mann-Kendall trend test
   statistic is discussed. A theoretical relationship is derived to
   calculate the variance of the Mann-Kendall test statistic for
   autocorrelated data. The special cases of AR(1) and MA(1) dependence are
   discussed as examples. An approximation to the theoretical relationship
   is also presented in order to reduce computation time for long time
   series. Based on the modified value of the variance of the Mann-Kendall
   trend test statistic, a modified non-parametric trend test which is
   suitable for autocorrelated data is proposed. The accuracy of the

Abstract = {{Transport of contaminants was analyzed for dual-porosity formations in
   which advection occurs only through fractures, but contaminants can
   diffuse into the rock matrix porosity. Transport was shown to occur in
   three distinct regimes: fracture, dual-porosity and total porosity
   transport. In the fracture transport regime, contaminant transport is
   controlled by fracture porosity alone. This was shown to end too quickly
   to have any significance ibr nuclear waste repositories like the Waste
   Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). Dual-porosity transport, in which
   contaminants are predominantly inside the matrix porosity and in the
   process of diffusing deeper into the rock, was shown to be controlled by
   a single formation parameter, called here the transport length, which
   can be estimated from tracer tests. Although conventional two-well
   tracer tests yield ambiguous values for fracture width and porosity,
   they provide useable estimates of the transport length. The effect on
   tracer tests of random heterogeneity and anisotropy in the formation was
   analyzed; the arithmetic mean of inferred values from different tests is
   the correct average for the transport length and the harmonic mean is
   the correct average for the kinematic porosity. Data were analyzed from
   nine tracer tests in a dual-porosity dolomite in the Culebra formation
   above the WIPP repository, including one test repeated at a different
   flow rare. The effect of dual-porosity on the mean transport rate of
   contaminants potentially leaking from the WIPP repository was shown to
   be negligible. Thus, for off-site transport at the WIPP, the formation
   is adequately modeled as a single-porosity, matrix-only medium. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{This paper examines the influence of a set of geology-vegetation groups
   and a number of dimensionless catchment properties, including
   topographic and climatic indices, on the baseflow index for 114
   catchments in Victoria, Australia, with areas ranging from 0.05 to 192
   km(2). There are 12 geology-vegetation groups, based on the geology and
   indigenous vegetation community of the catchment. They constitute the
   most important factor determining the value of baseflow index. The
   groups are considered as surrogates that represent climatic history, the
   capacity for recharge, and the transmissivity of the bedrock and soils.
   No trends are found in plots of baseflow index against any dimensionless
   topographic parameters within the geology-vegetation groups. Examination
   of annual trends in a catchment that was clearfelled in 1972 shows no
   evidence that baseflow index is affected by forest growth stage. There
   appears to be no effect of catchment size on baseflow index for
   catchment areas up to 100 km(2). The evidence is inconclusive as to a
   size effect outside this range. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A technique for baseflow separation is presented based on similarity
   solutions of the Boussinesq equation. The method makes use of the
   simplifying assumptions that a horizontal impermeable layer underlies a
   Dupuit aquifer which is drained by a fully penetrating stream. The value
   of the baseflow maximum as well as the baseflow recession hydrograph can
   be estimated by fitting the analytical solutions of the Boussinesq
   equation to the observed discharge values for individual flood events.
   For the rising limb of the baseflow hydrograph a linear function is
   assumed for simplicity. The method is first demonstrated on three
   watersheds for a total of five flood events and extensively applied over
   a three year period for the Mahantango Creek, Pennsylvania watershed.
   The proposed method reduces some of the subjective aspects long
   associated with baseflow separation techniques. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Many modeling studies of variable-density groundwater flow have been
   performed in the last few decades. In most of these studies, fluid
   density is considered to vary with concentration, while the variation of
   viscosity with concentration is neglected. The consequences of this
   negligence is not completely known. The present study uses a numerical
   simulation approach to investigate the density-viscosity-concentration
   relationship during groundwater flow and solute transport through a
   density-stratified system. Fluid density is assumed to increase with
   depth from freshwater at the surface, through brackish and saline
   waters, to brines at the bottom half of the system. The system mimics
   field observations at the Atikokan Research Area (ARA) in northwestern
   Ontario, Canada. Hypothetical `unit basin' models, consisting of
   recharge-, midline-and discharge-area regimes are employed.
   Simulations with the density-concentration equation of state and a
   constant (freshwater) viscosity in the density-stratified system causes
   groundwater to sink against the buoyancy forces of the system. More
   water is recharged into the system than necessitated by the buoyancy.
   The configurations and lengths of travel paths, and travel time of
   conservative contaminants are inaccurately predicted. Accounting for
   concentration in the viscosity equation causes groundwater floating in
   agreement with the expected buoyancy physics of the system.
   Overestimation of concentration-dependent density causes sinking,
   whereas, overestimation of viscosity results in overfloating and
   underestimation of groundwater recharge. Even in density-stratified
   fluids with salinity of seawater, recharge and through flow of water may
   be slightly overestimated if a concentration-dependent density is used
   along with a constant freshwater viscosity. The concentration dependence
   of both density and viscosity are to be analyzed carefully during
   groundwater flow and solute transport simulations in systems with
   considerable fluid density variations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-level slug test model and a method for the evaluation of
   vertical profiles of hydraulic conductivity in highly permeable
   formations are developed. A double-packer system is employed to estimate
   local hydraulic conductivity. Depending on the formation and
   double-packer system parameters, the water level recovery in the tested
   well can exhibit a monotonic or oscillatory response, To discern
   information on aquifer properties from artifacts introduced by the
   measurement system, the theory of flow in an aquifer and a double-packer
   system is developed. The mathematical model incorporates features of the
   Springer and Gelhar (1991) model and reduces to the Bouwer and Rice
   (1976) model in a special case. The model involves equations of momentum
   and mass conservation for the double-packer system with quasi-steady
   well-aquifer interaction equations, The method is uniformly applicable
   for both monotonic and oscillatory well responses and can produce
   profiles of hydraulic conductivity for the tested well. The criterion is
   given to determine the type of well response for given slug test
   conditions, (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B,V.}},

Abstract = {{Using the developed theory and modified Springer-Gelhar (SG) model, an
   identification method is proposed for estimating hydraulic conductivity
   from multi-level slug tests. The computerized algorithm calculates
   hydraulic conductivity from both monotonic and oscillatory well
   responses obtained using a double-packer system.
   Field verification of the method was performed at a specially designed
   fully penetrating well of 0.1-m diameter with a 10-m screen in a sand
   and gravel alluvial aquifer (MSEA site, Shelton, Nebraska). During well
   installation, disturbed core samples were collected every 0.6 m using a
   split-spoon sampler. Vertical profiles of hydraulic conductivity were
   produced on the basis of grain-size analysis of the disturbed core
   samples. These results closely correlate with the vertical profile of
   horizontal hydraulic conductivity obtained by interpreting multi-level
   slug test responses using the modified SG model.
   The identification method was applied to interpret the response from 474
   slug tests in 156 locations at the MSEA site. More than 60\% of
   responses were oscillatory. The method produced a good match to
   experimental data for both oscillatory and monotonic responses using an
   automated curve matching procedure. The proposed method allowed us to
   drastically increase the efficiency of each well used for aquifer
   characterization and to process massive arrays of field data.
   Recommendations generalizing this experience to massive application of
   the proposed method are developed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},
