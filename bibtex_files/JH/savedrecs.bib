Abstract = {{The `Systeme Hydrologique Europeen'(SHE) modelling system has been
   applied to six subcatchments totalling approximately 15 000 km2 of the
   Narmada Basin in Madhya Pradesh, central India. The study was carried
   out within the framework of an Indo-European cooperative project aimed
   at a transfer of the SHE technology to the National Institute of
   Hydrology, India. This paper presents the current status of the SHE, and
   then focuses on the experiences gained in applying it to basins of a
   size likely to be of practical interest, with a data availability
   characteristic of developing countries. Results from the largest of the
   six basins are presented and discussed along with summary results from
   all six basins. The procedures adopted and practical recommendations are
   given with regard to data collection, model preparation and parameter
   assessment, calibration approach and planning of field investigations.
   Finally, general conclusions regarding SHE applicability to Indian
   hydrological conditions are presented.}},

Title = {{THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS STATISTICAL-METHOD AS A COMPLEMENTARY APPROACH
   TO GEOCHEMICAL METHODS IN WATER-QUALITY FACTOR IDENTIFICATION -
   APPLICATION TO THE COASTAL-PLAIN AQUIFER OF ISRAEL}},

Abstract = {{In general, Schoeller and PipeT diagrams, as well as other classical
   techniques, facilitate the description of the various geochemical groups
   of water, and help to explain quality changes in an aquifer. We propose
   the use mainly of `principal components' analysis for identification of
   relevant groups of water and the factors that bring about a change in
   their quality. The major advantage of this method is its suitability for
   simultaneous analysis of a great number of variables and observations.
   It is here being applied for the investigation of the Dan metropolitan
   region of Israel's Coastal Plain. The variables involved include major
   ions as well as the physical factors of depth of the well intake filter
   below sea-level, distance from the sea, and aquifer recharge. The
   primary purpose of this work is to demonstrate the use and reliability
   of principal components analysis (PCA) as a method complementary to
   classical approaches for hydrogeochemical research. Subsidiary purposes
   involve determination of the major water groups characterizing the
   Coastal Plain aquifer, identification of some of the principal variables
   that influence changes in water quality in the aquifer, and description
   of some of the geochemical phenomena contributing to change in aquifer
   water quality. The following results were achieved for the test area:
   (1) Two major groups of water were identified: a low-salinity, calcium
   bicarbonate water occurring in the phreatic portion of the Coastal Plain
   aquifer, and a more saline, sodium chloride water characterizing the
   neighboring Cenomanian aquifer and the confined portions of the Coastal
   Plain aquifer. (2) The major water input sources, such as rain,
   injection water, waste water, irrigation, etc., may vary in their
   influence upon resulting water quality; this water quality is affected
   by such physical factors as distance from the sea, depth of well intake
   filters below sea-level, proximity to streams and the lithology of the
   saturated and unsaturated zones. (3) The evolutionary alteration in
   content of specific ions with time can be clearly visualized on the same
   graph by means of PCA.
   The universal applicability of such a statistical approach to other
   hydrological settings is noted.}},

Abstract = {{Typical Ca-Cl brines occur in crystalline and metamorphic rocks below
   freshwater horizons at various localities in Sweden and Finland. Total
   dissolved solids (TDS) range in concentration between 2 and 120 g l-1
   and have long been thought to derive from water-rock interactions. The
   relationships between Na, Cl and Br in these brines suggest, however,
   that they were derived from freezing of seawater during glacial periods.
   The brines were subsequently diluted by meteoric waters and their Ca/Mg
   ratio was increased through water-rock interactions in the subsurface.
   The hydrogeological model for both the formation of freeze-derived
   marine brines and their lateral intrusion involves restricted inland
   marine basins in recent and subrecent polar climatic belts. Seawater in
   such basins gradually freezes in response to glaciation. The solutes
   which concentrate in the remaining water body are residual after
   precipitation of a sequence of minerals which include carbonates,
   mirabilite and hydrohalite. Hydraulic pressure of the growing ice sheet
   over the frozen seas is gradually added to the ambient hydrostatic
   pressure exerted on the brines. This, together with their increased
   density, increases the intrusional potential of the brines. As the land
   ice cannot exert hydraulic pressure on continental groundwater in the
   aquifers, the balance of pressure favours deep landward intrusion of
   brines. Post-glacial processes cause the subsurface dilution and
   replacement of the brines both by seawater and fresh waters. The
   presence of such brines also far from present-day coastal settings
   reflects the shifting of coastlines as a result of isostatic movements
   and eustatic sea-level changes associated with glaciation and
   deglaciation.}},

Abstract = {{Isotope and hydrochemical data of the thermal water system in Cieplice
   Slaskie Zdroj (Spa) indicate the existence of two subsystems that
   greatly differ in volume and which meet at the fault zones of a granitic
   horst, where they discharge at an altitude of about 340 m. One of the
   subsystems is very small (about 4 x 10(3) m3) as indicated by the
   tritium age of the order of 10 years and a low outflow rate. Its
   recharge area found from the deltaO-18 and deltaD values, is about 200 m
   above the springs, most probably on the slopes of the foothills of the
   Karkonosze Mountains south-southwest of the spa. The large subsystem
   contains water which is free of tritium and whose C-14 content is from 1
   to 8 pmc with deltaC-13 = -8.0 to -9.2 parts per thousand. The isotopic
   composition of this water reflects either the climatic effect
   (low-altitude recharge during a cooler pre-Holocene climate) or the
   altitude effect (recharge in the early Holocene period at about 1000 m
   at the heights of the Karkonosze assuming that the C-14 concentration is
   strongly reduced by exchange with calcite in veins). For the former
   hypothesis, the recharge area of this water is probably either at the
   foot of the southeastern slopes of the Kaczawa Mountains or/and at the
   foot of the Rudawy Janowickie Mountains, to the east of Cieplice. The
   noble gas temperatures are more consistent with the pre-Holocene
   recharge. Similarly, the He-4 excess and Ar-40/Ar-36 ratio support the
   hypothesis of a pre-Holecene age. The constant He-3/He-4 ratio of 26 x
   10(-8) for highly different helium contents indicates crustal origin of
   helium. For the pre-Holocene age of water its volume is calculated at
   greater-than-or-equal-to 10(9) m3 (stagnant water in micropores and
   mobile water in fractures) and the hydraulic conductivity of the host
   granite massif is estimated at about 7 x 10(-8) ms-1. Two outflows from
   this subsystem have different and variable fractions of a modern water
   component (bomb age), most probably originating from the bank
   infiltration of a nearby stream.}},

Abstract = {{Streamwater chemistry is described for three streams draining
   undisturbed, evergreen broad-leaved forested catchments on phyllites in
   NE Spain: two streams with no or negligible flow in summer are in the
   Prades massif, and one perennial stream is in the wetter Montseny
   mountains. Weekly data for a study period of 2-4 years are provided to
   (1) describe the seasonal variations in streamwater chemistry, (2)
   analyse the relationship between stream discharge and solute
   concentrations using a two-component mixing model and (3) search for
   patterns of temporal variation in stream solute concentrations after
   discounting the effects of discharge. At Prades, concentrations of all
   analysed ions, except NO3-, showed marked seasonal variations in stream
   water, whereas at Montseny only ions related to mineral weathering
   (HCO3-, Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+) showed strong seasonality. Ion
   concentrations were more closely dependent on instantaneous discharge at
   Montseny than at Prades. The residuals of the relationship between
   solute concentrations and discharge retained a strong seasonality at
   Prades, but not at Montseny. These differences are related to the major
   hydrochemical processes that determine the streamwater chemistry at each
   site. The same processes are probably operative in the three catchments,
   but are of varying relative importance. At Montseny, the mixing of
   waters of different chemical composition seems to be the major process
   controlling streamwater chemistry, although the soilwater end-member
   composition predicted by the mixing model applied did not match the
   measured soilwater chemistry. In the drier Prades catchments, the two
   major hydrochemical processes determining the seasonal variation of
   streamwater chemistry are (1) the restart of flow after the summer
   drought, which flushes out the solutes accumulated during the dry
   period, and (2) the seasonal changes in groundwater chemistry that
   result from the interplay of water residence time, temperature and CO2
   partial pressure. In Mediterranean catchments with relatively high
   precipitation, such as Montseny, the seasonal variation in the
   streamwater chemistry is largely determined by the same processes as at
   humid-temperate sites, whereas in drier Mediterranean catchments, such
   as Prades, the major hydrochemical processes are clearly distinct.}},

Abstract = {{The results of an extensive study of streamwater chemistry during
   stormflow events, for a montane Mediterranean area, are presented. Four
   groups of variables are identified as having contrasting behaviour:
   alkalinity and pH; nitrate and potassium; sulphate and chloride; sodium,
   calcium and magnesium. The results show a complex pattern of response to
   flow that can be broadly linked to: (1) antecedent hydrological
   conditions; (2) rainfall intensity; (3) supplies of water from
   chemically distinct areas within the catchment. However, comparisons
   between this study and a parallel one which examined the composition of
   waters within the catchment, show that it is presently impossible to
   quantify the relative supplies from each part of the catchment. The
   findings are reviewed in relation to analogous studies within a European
   setting and in relation to modelling initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{Results are presented of a study of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes
   in rainfall and streamwaters for the Montseny and Prades areas in
   northeastern Spain: results cover the full year of 1991. The isotopic
   pattem for rainfall is similar for both areas: there is a wide range in
   isotopic contents and the results show a strong, near-linear trend,
   deltaH-2 = 7.9 x deltaO-18 + 9.8 (N = 59; r2 = 0.952), the `local
   meteoric line'. There is slight curvature to the data which may be
   related to the sources of water vapour forming the rainfall. Within the
   streams, the isotopic variability is much less than that of the rainfall
   although the data lie on, or very near to, the meteoric line. Data for
   detailed collections during storm events show more scatter than those
   collected regularly on a fortnightly basis. The event data show a linear
   feature that conforms to the local meteoric line. These results indicate
   that: (1) the main supply of water to the stream stormflow comes from
   water stored in the catchment prior to the event; (2) waters of more
   than one isotopic composition reside within the catchment and are
   transferable to the stream during storm events; (3) the main process of
   water transfer from the catchment back to the atmosphere comes from
   transpiration by the trees and (possibly) complete evaporation from the
   near-surface soil horizons and the tree canopy; (4) the isotopic
   technique cannot be used for quantitative hydrograph separation in this
   instance - at least two water types can be present within the catchment
   at any given time.}},

Abstract = {{Streamwater samples were collected during 1987-1988 from two adjacent
   gauged watersheds, the subalpine-alpine East St. Lows and the Fool Creek
   Alpine, in the Fraser Experimental Forest, Colorado. The study objective
   was to compare the relationships between streamwater discharge and ion
   concentration in alpine and alpine-subalpine watersheds at a site
   receiving low inputs of atmospheric contaminants. Streamwater discharge
   accounts for much of the variation in ion concentration. Trajectories of
   time, discharge, and ion concentration suggest that patterns of nutrient
   flux are controlled primarily by the magnitude of streamwater discharge,
   and seasonal differences in the relative contributions of snowmelt and
   soil water. In the subalpine catchment, increased streamwater discharge
   accounted for most of the decline in concentration of ions, with high
   concentrations in soil water relative to precipitation. This
   relationship was not seen in the alpine catchment, probably because of
   the influence of large diurnal variation in the ratio of snowmelt to
   soil water. In both catchments, ions with comparatively high
   concentrations in precipitation and the snowpack relative to soil water
   showed less concentration decline with increased streamwater discharge.
   The recurring nature of the trajectories, especially in the subalpine
   catchment, suggests that the time, discharge, and ion concentration
   patterns may represent a general characteristic in moderate-sized,
   undisturbed Rocky Mountain catchments which do not receive high inputs
   of airborne contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{Certain aspects of data generation are studied through multivariate
   autoregressive (AR) models. The main emphasis is on the preservation of
   certain desired moments and the effect of initial values on these
   moments. The problem of preservation of moments is approached in a
   nontraditional way by starting with the initial values. For this
   purpose, general AR processes with a random start and with time-varying
   parameters are introduced to lay a foundation for the analysis of all
   types of AR processes, including the periodic cases. It is shown that an
   AR process with a random start and with parameters obtained from the
   moment equations is capable of generating jointly multivariate normal
   vectors with any specified means and covariance matrices, and with any
   specified autocovariance matrices up to a given lag. With a random
   start, there is no transition period involved for achieving these
   moments. A simple solution is proposed for matrix equations of the form
   BB(T) = A which appear in the moment equations. The aggregation
   properties of general AR process are also studied.
   A more detailed analysis is given for the two-period first-order
   periodic autoregressive model, PAR2(1). For the PAR2(l) process with a
   random start and with parameters obtained from the moment equations, it
   is shown that the autocovariance function depends only on the period and
   the lag, and therefore the process is periodic (covariance) stationary.
   The PAR2(1) process with a fixed start is also studied. It is shown that
   the moments of this process depend on the absolute time, in addition to
   the period and the lag, and therefore the process is not periodic
   stationary. This dependence diminishes with time, and periodic
   stationarity is realized if the AR parameters satisfy certain
   conditions. In that case, the PAR2(1) process with a fixed start
   converges to that with a random start, but only after a certain
   transition period. This proves the superiority of a random start over a
   fixed start.}},

Abstract = {{During a 3 month recharge experiment related to conjunctive use of water
   resources, 1.5 x 10(6)T of imported water were percolated through a pond
   of 128 m by 128 m in the San Jacinto basin. The infiltration rates,
   which declined with time, averaged 1.9 m day-1, equivalent to four times
   the lowest laboratory measured hydraulic conductivity of the fluvial
   deposits. Ponding altered the unimodal grain-size distribution at the
   ground surface to types without a dominant mode, but this redistribution
   did not always lead to reduction in conductivities, which varied over at
   least three orders of magnitude. The water table 80 m downstream from
   the ponding edge began to rise slowly 1 month after the start of
   ponding; it leveled off at 8 m above the pre-recharge water table depth
   of 75 m and did not recede 2 months after termination of ponding. Water
   levels in wells bottomed in the original vadose zone suggested that an
   inverted water table migrated downward to meet the rising water table.
   Minor, local perching occurred at 14 m depth, as indicated by the
   presence of moist ground near one monitoring well and by hydraulic
   responses during a 20 day intermission in percolation. As it percolated
   through the sediments, the imported northern California water pined Ca
   but lost Mg, so that the Mg/Ca ratio resembled that of local ground
   water. Such cation exchange has also been demonstrated by leaching
   experiments in the laboratory. However, the characteristics of the
   original source waters appear to be retained by D/H isotope ratios and
   Cl concentrations, as well as cross-plots of SO4 vs. Cl and B vs. Cl.
   Such unreactive tracers could serve  to monitor transport and mixing of
   the chemically diverse water used in future recharge programs in the San
   Jacinto basin.}},

Abstract = {{In field applications, upstream spreading of contaminant plumes may be
   controlled by the flow of fresh water in a direction opposite to the
   dispersive expansion direction of the plume. In the current literature
   this type of control is identified as flow against dispersion or
   contrary flow. In this study analytic methods are used to investigate
   contrary flow conditions for two-dimensional applications. In
   particular, special attention is given to the dispersive spread of the
   contaminant plume in the transverse direction under equilibrium flow
   against dispersion. Typical problems analyzed emphasize the effect of
   adsorption and transverse dispersion on the overall control process.
   Problems analyzed indicate that equilibrium flow velocities deduced from
   one-dimensional analysis, which may balance the dispersive spread of the
   plume in the longitudinal direction, represent an over design condition
   when these equlibrium velocities are compared with the conditions
   generated from a two-dimensional model for a downstream source which is
   finite in the transverse direction.}},

Abstract = {{The Malloryville Wetland Complex, a small kettle-hole peatland, contains
   a diversity of peatland types. The wetland has a `rich' side that
   contains wetland vegetation associated with solute-rich, near-neutral pH
   (minerotrophic) water, and a `poor' side containing vegetation that
   grows in solute-poor and acidic (ombrotrophic) water. Vertical head
   gradients at piezometer clusters located in the rich side clearly show
   that groundwater is moving upwards towards the land surface, consistent
   with the vegetation types and surface water quality. In contrast,
   vertical head gradients also show that groundwater is moving upward in
   the poor side even though the vegetation and surface water chemistry are
   not minerotrophic. An incipient raised bog in the center of the poor
   side is the only site where groundwater moves consistently downward.
   A peat core collected at the bog center shows that the bog site was
   initially covered by minerotrophic vegetation, typically found in
   groundwater discharge zones, which was later replaced by ombrotrophic
   bog vegetation. Theoretical computer simulation experiments of the bog
   hydrogeologic setting through time suggest that the direction of
   vertical groundwater flow at the bog site permanently changed from up to
   down when a water table mound developed under a convex-shaped fen peat
   mound that probably formed because of differential peat accumulation.
   Ombrotrophic conditions and bog vegetation probably began when the fen
   water table mound grew sufficiently large enough to divert the upward
   movement of regional groundwater. The transition from rich to poor
   environments probably occurred when the wetland water table was
   substantially below the elevation of the surrounding regional water
   table.}},

Abstract = {{Comparison of groundwater quality data ten years apart and sampling of
   shallow level water and soil gas CO2 indicates that the groundwaters
   below Birmingham are becoming more acidic. Six potential causes are
   considered: (1) rise of water level into the carbonate-poor upper levels
   of the sandstone aquifer, (2) oxidation of the Quaternary deposits
   overlying the aquifer; (3) inorganic acid spills; (4) other acidic
   recharge; (5) oxidation of inorganic pollutants; (6) degradation of
   industrial organic pollutants. Chemical and hydrogeological data suggest
   that (3), (5) and (6) are dominant in different parts of the city. The
   rate of fall in pH of 0.6 units over ten years is worrying with regard
   to increased solubility of toxic metals.}},

Abstract = {{Equations which relate sediment delivery to a power function of flow
   rate and slope gradient were evaluated in this study. The data used to
   parameterize the equations were obtained from sites where crop residues
   had been removed, and moldboard plowing and disking had occurred.
   Measurements of sediment delivery resulting from simulated rainfall were
   obtained from preformed rills and interrill areas. The equations
   provided reliable sediment delivery estimates for selected soils located
   throughout the United States. To use the sediment delivery equations,
   soil-related parameter values must be identified. Multiple regression
   analyses were performed to relate parameter values used in the equations
   to selected soil properties. Equations were also developed for
   estimating rill sediment delivery under rainfall conditions from rill
   soil loss and discharge data collected without the addition of rainfall.
   The equations identified in this study, and appropriate soils
   information, can be used to predict sediment delivery on both rill and

Abstract = {{Measurements of tritium and O-18 concentrations in precipitation and
   runoff were used to provide further insight into the groundwater storage
   properties of the Wimbachtal Valley, a catchment area of 33.4 km2,
   extending between 636 and 2713 m a.s.l. in the Berchtesgaden Alps. The
   catchment includes three aquifer types: a dominant porous aquifer; a
   fractured dolomite; a karstic limestone aquifer. Employing a simple
   hydrological model, information about mean transit times of
   environmental tracers is derived for the groundwater runoff component
   and several karst springs from the application of the exponential and
   dispersion flow models to the isotopic input and output data. The mean
   transit times calculated from a dispersion model with transit times of
   4.1 years for O-18 and 4.2 years for tritium, which agree well, allow
   calculation of total (mobile + stagnant) groundwater storage volume,
   which is equivalent to 6.6 m of water depth. Direct runoff appears

Abstract = {{An acidification experiment was conducted on a small stream in the Loch
   Ard area of central Scotland. The stream was chosen because of its
   large, flow related, variation in pH (5.9-4.0). Two acid additions were
   made to approximately pH 3.5-3.7. The results indicated a strong
   correlation between labile aluminium and hydrogen, and a noticeable
   hysteresis in the response of calcium and hydrogen. It is hypothesised
   that divalent cation response is a result of ion-exchange mechanisms
   involving the streambed vegetation, with aluminium release resulting
   primarily from exchange reactions with streambed sediment stores. Data
   from a program of stream spot sampling have been analysed in an attempt
   to elucidate the contribution of different sources of aluminium under
   different flow conditions. Streambed sources of aluminium contribute
   significantly under low flow conditions; however, at high flow,
   additional sources of aluminium must contribute to match observed
   streamwater chemistry.}},

   EXTRACTING SOIL-WATER OR STABLE ISOTOPIC ANALYSIS}},

Abstract = {{Hanford Loam, from Richland, Washington, was used as a test soil to
   determine the precision, accuracy and nature of two methods to extract
   soil water for stable isotopic analysis: azeotropic distillation using
   toluene, and simple heating under vacuum. The soil was oven dried,
   rehydrated with water of known stable isotopic compositions, and the
   introduced water was then extracted.
   Compared with the introduced water, initial aliquots of evolved water
   taken during a toluene extraction were as much as 30 parts per thousand
   more depleted in D and 2.7 parts per thousand more depleted in O-18,
   whereas final aliquots were as much as 40 parts per thousand more
   enriched in D and 14.3 parts per thousand more enriched in O-18. Initial
   aliquots collected during the vacuum/heat extraction were as much as 64
   parts per thousand more depleted in D and 8.4 parts per thousand more
   depleted in O-18 than was the introduced water, whereas the final
   aliquots were as much as 139 parts per thousand more enriched in D, and
   20.8 parts per thousand more enriched in O-18. Neither method appears
   quantitative; however, the difference in stable isotopic composition
   between the first and last aliquots of water extracted by the toluene
   method is less than that from the vacuum/heat method. This is attributed
   to the smaller fractionation factors involved with the higher average
   temperatures of distillation of the toluene. The average stable isotopic
   compositions of the extracted water varied from that of the introduced
   water by up to 1.4 parts per thousand in deltaD and 4.2 parts per
   thousand in deltaO-18 with the toluene method, and by 11.0 parts per
   thousand in deltaD and 1.8 parts per thousand in deltaO-18 for the
   vacuum/heat method.
   The lack of accuracy of the extraction methods is thought to be due to
   isotopic fractionation associated with water being weakly bound (not
   released below 110-degrees-C) in the soil. The isotopic effect of this
   heat-labile water is larger at low water contents (3.6 and 5.2\% water
   by weight) as the water bound in the soil is a commensurately larger
   fraction of the total. With larger soilwater contents the small volume
   of water bound with an associated fractionation is not enough to affect
   the remaining unbound introduced soil water. Pretreatment of the soil to
   equilibrate the heat-labile water to the test water produced good
   results for the toluene distillation but not the vacuum/heat extraction
   method.
   Vapors collected over the soils also show stable isotopic variations
   related to soilwater content. These vapors also appear to be in closer
   equilibrium with the free water, as extracted by the toluene method,
   than with the originally introduced water; thus, the soil vapors do not
   appear to be isotopically affected by the heat-labile water.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the isotopic O-18/O-16 and D/H ratios reported in the
   literature for phreatic waters in the plain of Vulcano island off Sicily
   and condensates from high-temperature fumaroles at the top of the summit
   crater. The Vulcano phreatic waters have a rather high average annual
   temperature (greater than 30-degrees-C), but do not seem to be heated
   directly by mixture with condensates of fumarolic steam. They seem to
   originate from rainwater and to undergo high evaporation, particularly
   in summer, owing to high conductive heat flow in the island. By
   comparing the O-18/O-16 and D/H ratios with Cl- (as HCl) content, it is
   estimated that 75\% of the steam from the high-temperature fumaroles
   comes from seawater and 25\% from low-salinity waters. The latter,
   however, do not seem to come directly from the shallow aquifer of
   Vulcano because the steam from the fumaroles does not contain radiogenic
   tritium. This mixing model and the lack of steam condensation in the
   Vulcano aquifer implies, indirectly, that there are no steam losses
   during the rise of deep fluids, and that some observed variations in the
   outlet temperatures without accompanying variations in the composition
   of the associated gas phase may be due to increased (or decreased)
   extent of fracturation in the volcanic edifice (as a result, for
   instance, of tectonic movements), which cause more (or less)
   vaporization of low-salinity fresh water into the volcanic ducts as well
   as faster (or slower) outflow of deep gases.}},

Abstract = {{Stable isotope (O-18 and H-2) and geochemical signatures are used to
   gain some insight into recharge processes and groundwater salinization
   mechanisms in a semi-arid rangeland catchment. The 665 km2 catchment is
   underlain by fractured lower Beaufort sandstones and mudstones and is
   intruded by several dolerite dykes. Chloride and isotopic relationships
   suggest that chloride ions in ground water are of meteoric origin. The
   hypothesized recharge and salinization mechanism is that large storm
   events periodically dissolve accumulated surficial meteoric salts and,
   after a period of evaporative enrichment at or near the soil surface,
   leach them into the ground water. Geochemical variations imply that
   spatial differences exist in recharge volumes, in evaporative enrichment
   or in the extent of leaching of surficial salts. Meteoric sodium
   chloride contributes greater than 90\% of the dissolved sodium, except
   at low salinities, where cation exchange processes yield additional
   sodium inputs in exchange for dissolved calcium and magnesium. At high
   salinities this process reverses and sodium is adsorbed, releasing
   calcium and magnesium. This process accounts for up to 40\% of the
   dissolved calcium and magnesium. Contributions from geochemical
   weathering are relatively uniform in spite of highly variable
   salinities, which implies that residence times are also relatively
   uniform.}},

   revealed: (a) variations of several orders of magnitude of ion
   concentrations (40-63 000 mg Cl l-1) in ground waters encountered in
   wells 2-46 m deep; (b) variations exceeding an order of magnitude in the
   salinity observed in depth profiles of individual wells; (c) positive
   linear correlations between the concentrations of Cl, Br, Na and Mg,
   observed in all the study areas, and similar correlations also with Ca,
   K and SO4 in part of these areas; (d) marine-like relative ionic
   concentration abundances of Cl, Br, Na and Mg in the six study areas,
   and of Ca, K and SO4 in part of the areas; (e) concentrations of the
   various ions distinctly below saturation with halite, Br-containing
   salts or gypsum. Observations of this nature are shown to provide a
   powerful tool to establish: (a) lack of fractionation between the marine
   ions during the atmospheric transport, (b) salt input dominated by
   marine airborne salts, (c) operation of evapotranspiration from the
   regolith in calculable degrees that vary from one surface cell to
   another, (d) lack of salt phases in the aquifer materials, (e) dominance
   of local (vertical) recharge over remote (lateral) recharge, (f)
   infiltration of active recharge through preferred pathways in the
   aerated zone, (g) storage of ground water in local compartments, (h)
   amount of annual recharge in each unit of area, and (i) hydrochemical
   maturity of the local hydrological system. Rise of water tables, as a
   result of forest clearing, produces a different flow regime for water
   and solutes. The depth of the aerated zone is drastically reduced,
   saline interstitial water is mobilized from the aquifer (the former
   aerated zone), and previously productive land becomes degraded by

Abstract = {{The permeability of a rock fracture is controlled primarily by the
   geometry of its void space. One effect of void space geometry is to
   cause the fluid to follow a tortuous path to flow around the asperities,
   which are regions where the two faces of the fracture are in contact. To
   examine the tortuosity induced by the contact area, we consider an
   idealized fracture consisting of two parallel plates propped open by
   isolated asperities. Boundary-element calculations, analogue electrical
   conductivity measurements and an effective medium approximation are used
   to study the permeability of fractures with circular, elliptical and
   irregular asperity shapes. The permeability is seen to depend not only
   on the amount of contact area, but also on the shape of the asperities.
   For circular or elliptical asperities, very accurate estimates are found
   by using the effective medium theory proposed by Maxwell.}},

Abstract = {{The horizontal and vertical distribution of orographic rainfall over
   ridges of height approximately 150 m was resolved by a dense rain gauge
   network and rainfall radar. Orographic enhancements of up to about 2 mm
   h-1 were found in conditions typical of wintertime warm fronts and warm
   sectors in the UK. The enhancement magnitude (averaged over a few hours)
   was found to depend partly upon the surface wind and the average
   background rainfall rate. The growth of orographic precipitation was
   observed in cloud layers of varying depth; in one case, significant
   enhancement occurred within cloud with a total depth of no more than
   1500 m. Doubt is cast upon the applicability of some existing models of
   the seeder-feeder mechanism to cases such as this. In this and other
   respects, our conclusions differ from earlier findings. The observations
   highlight the difficulty in estimation of surface rainfall rate by radar
   if the beam is several hundred metres or more above the surface. If no
   attempt is made to correct for precipitation growth beneath the beam,
   serious underestimation of rainfall is likely, even in lowland regions
   with hills of about 100 m height.}},

Abstract = {{The present study offers a contribution to the understanding of the
   problem of migration of radioactive elements from a deep disposal zone
   to Man's environment after a repository failure. More precisely, it
   proposes to shed light on the possible involvement of colloidal matter
   in the transport velocity and residence time of radionuclides.
   Interaction mechanisms between the different components of the modeled
   system, i.e. water, solutes, colloids and solid media, describe the
   retention capacity of the geological medium, the final barrier between
   pollutant and environment. In a first attempt to model migration of
   colloids through a fractured medium, we used simple models describing
   the interaction between the colloids, solute and rock matrix: a linear
   adsorption isotherm with or without a maximum adsorption capacity and
   the Langmuir isotherm.
   Colloids may be generated when ionic metal species hydrolyse and
   precipitate, forming so-called `true' or `intrinsic' colloids.
   Redissolution of the colloids is envisaged when the solute fraction
   drops below its solubility limit. Simulations with a numerical transport
   model demonstrate the effects of uranium leakage in a fractured granitic
   rock when the generation of colloidal uranium is considered.
   It is shown how, in a given flow velocity field, the residence time of
   the total uranium mass depends highly on the retention capacity of the
   medium. The maximum adsorbed fraction appears to be a key parameter and
   different hypothetical values are used in order to evaluate the
   quantitative effects. The diffusion of soluble uranium into the
   micro-fissures of the rock matrix also appears as an important process,
   even for transport of the colloidal phase.}},

Abstract = {{This study was undertaken to investigate the potential ground-water
   recharge resulting from a nuclear subsidence crater on the Nevada Test
   Site. Results from two boreholes, one completed in the subsidence crater
   bottom and the other completed in an adjacent undisturbed area, suggest
   that deep infiltration of periodically ponded runoff water at the Crater
   bottom is occurring, whereas little or no deep infiltration was evident
   in the adjacent, undisturbed area. Specialized drilling, coring and
   borehole logging revealed high water contents and a unit hydraulic
   gradient downward beneath the subsidence crater. Traditional soil
   physics analysis via Darcy's law and core samples suggested a wide range
   of downward fluid velocities and fluxes beneath the crater. In contrast,
   soil water tritium concentrations, combined with several mixing models,
   significantly reduced the range of estimated fluxes. Based upon these
   models, it is suggested that the vertical flux beneath the crater is on
   the order of 0.6 m year-1. It is postulated that the surface topography,
   combined with the coarse-textured soils beneath the crater, allows for
   the deep infiltration of ephemerally ponded water at the bottom. In the
   adjacent undisturbed (and topographically flat-lying) site, significant
   ponding does not occur, and evaporation and transpiration processes
   recycle much, if not all, of the precipitation falling on the surface.}},

Abstract = {{Recent hydrogeological studies in southwestern Uganda have focused on
   the resource potential of crystalline basement rocks of Pre-Cambrian
   age. These rocks are a major source of potable water for many
   communities throughout equatorial Africa, but are rarely evaluated
   hydrogeologically prior to development. Consequently, the risk of
   resource over-exploitation is not known and few reliable data are
   available for formulating effective groundwater management policies.
   The studies show that the basement rocks of the region form a very weak
   aquifer which is highly susceptible to over-production and water-level
   decline. Soil zone recharge is normally very low with a median value of
   just 17 mm year-1. Aquifer throughflow calculations indicate that less
   than 1 \% of this amount is transmitted via the bedrock aquifer. As a
   consequence, future problems may include the lowering of water levels in
   production wells and the drying up of natural springs. The risk of such
   problems imposes serious constraints on the bedrock aquifer's future use
   and development.
   On a positive note, it is believed that the aquifer within the overlying
   regolith may be transmitting the considerable majority of the soil-zone
   recharge and, therefore, may provide the key to future resource
   development in the region. Development of this aquifer may be achieved
   either through wells constructed and screened in the regolith's
   water-bearing zone, or, where conditions permit, through deeper bedrock
   wells inducing vertical leakage by pumping.}},

Abstract = {{During the monsoon period, 75\% of the annual rainfall, 73\% of the
   annual water discharge and 85\% of the annual sediment transport takes
   place in the Cauvery River. Basin geology and river water discharge are
   the major natural factors controlling the sediment transport. Sediment
   transport in the Cauvery River is greatly influenced by the presence of
   two major dams built across the river. An examination of the
   particle-size distribution of the suspended sediments shows that the
   less than 20 mum fraction accounts for nearly 60\% of the total sediment
   transported by the river. At dam sites, coarse sediments are selectively
   removed from the suspended load. The suspended mineralogy is dominated
   by quartz and feldspar, followed by clay minerals and carbonates. Clay
   minerals average about 30\% and are dominated by the montmorillonite
   type.  The results of our study also demonstrate the importance of such
   sediment characteristics as particle size and mineralogy in controlling
   the trace metal distribution in sediments.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed study of surface water chemistry is described from an
   important limestone region in northern England. Major ions and pH were
   determined for 485 sites (springs, seeps, streams, rivers and lakes)
   during summertime. The saturation state of the waters with respect to
   calcite was determined as the calcite saturation ratio (OMEGA). An
   unexpectedly large number of samples were found to be supersaturated
   (65.5\% of the 268 km of watercourses surveyed). As a consequence,
   several streams entering major cave systems were incapable of further
   limestone solution, at least during periods of low flow. Many waters
   were supersaturated from their source and some deposited travertine. A
   significant negative correlation was found between spring discharge and
   both (OMEGA) and pH. Supersaturation was caused primarily by atmospheric
   degassing, with some contribution from aquatic plant photosynthesis.
   The median total dissolved inorganic carbon and Ca concentrations were
   2.49 and 1.35 millimoles l-1 respectively. Calcium originated
   exclusively from limestone, and carbon dioxide mainly from the soil and
   dissolved limestone. South facing catchments provided springwaters with
   significantly higher levels of TDIC and Ca when compared with north
   facing catchments. The study suggests that acid rain made a measurable
   contribution to limestone dissolution.
   Carboniferous limestone denudation rates were estimated as 54 to 63 m3
   km-2 a-1 (54 to 63 mm 1000 years-1). About 50\% of the Mg came from
   limestone and the remainder, together with most K, Na, SO4 and Cl from
   precipitation.
   Concentrations of dissolved nutrients were low, medians for NO3, NH4,
   total PO4 and SiO3 were 24 mumol, 1.4 mumol, 0.64 mumol and 15.5 mumol
   l-1 respectively. The concentration of a further 23 trace elements was
   determined.}},

Abstract = {{The literature on valley and drainage line recognition from grid digital
   elevation models (DEMs) is reviewed. Two problems preventing the
   successful delineation of fully connected drainage networks of
   single-line width are identified: (a) the positioning of the ends of
   drainage networks, and (b) the assignment of drainage directions to a
   DEM, in particular the assignment of drainage directions across flat
   areas and at closed depressions in the DEM ('pits'). A new method for
   drainage network delineation is suggested which incorporates an
   alternative method for drainage direction assignment over a DEM. This
   method is found to produce realistic directions, and performs well on
   two complex DEMs.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Volume = {{138}},

Pages = {{327-343}},

Abstract = {{The source of brine that has caused the salinization of Lake Kinneret is
   still disputed. Another controversial issue is whether the driving head
   of the brine is freshwater dependent, or whether it has a driving head
   of its own. This paper describes the various hypotheses regarding the
   origin of the brine and the salinization mechanism in the lake. Although
   the question of brine origin remains unanswered, statistical analyses
   (e.g. linear correlations) of the annual chloride contribution to the
   lake (SBB), and annual water inflows from Lake Kinneret saline springs
   and ground water (QB), indicate that these parameters are inversely
   related. This phenomenon means that the fresh water in the aquifers
   draining into Lake Kinneret has a regulating effect on brine discharges.
   The aquifers should therefore not be overutilized, as the hydraulic head
   acts as ballast controlling emergence of the brine in the lake shores
   and bottom. Although developed for Lake Kinneret, the identification
   procedure of the QB-SBB relationship may be used for other lakes,
   contributing towards a better understanding of the mechanisms governing
   their salinization.}},

Abstract = {{It is necessary to operate Lake Kinneret in the future according to
   revised policies. This has required development of a tool which permits
   a forecast of the effect of the revised operating rules on the quality
   and quantity of available water for direct consumption from the lake.
   For this purpose, a combined daily water and chloride inflow simulation
   model, M8KNRT, was developed. This paper presents a description of the
   model, which is based on the inverse relationship between water inflows
   to Lake Kinneret from saline springs and ground water, and their
   chloride contribution to the lake. This concept, implying that fresh
   aquifer heads and discharges regulate the brine fluxes, is the most
   important feature of the M8KNRT model. The excellent results achieved
   following calibration of the model based on simulation of water and
   chloride inflows to Lake Kinneret, and on chloride concentrations in the
   lake confirm its validity for use in future forecasts under different
   operating conditions within the lake watershed. The model is structured
   in general form, allowing it to be applied to any other lake with
   similar problems.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, we have used automated procedures to develop simple, yet
   accurate, ways to create runoff contour maps. Our goal was to produce
   maps as accurate as those now produced by manual methods. We developed
   eight procedures based on simple water balance methods and regression
   techniques to produce a map for our test case, Water-Year 1984 for the
   northeastern United States. Our maps are produced by linear
   interpolation of (1) gaged runoff at watershed centroids, and (2) runoff
   estimated at a set of geographic locations (precipitation stations) via
   each of the eight procedures.
   We evaluated the maps both qualitatively and quantitatively. We visually
   compared the automated procedure maps with a manual map produced by the
   U.S. Geological Survey. In general, visual agreement was very good. We
   then statistically compared the estimated runoff at the precipitation
   stations with values interpolated from the manual map. Comparing simple
   mean runoff, we found that two of the automated procedures gave the best
   results when compared with the manual map (MAN84; mean annual runoff =
   84.0 cm). One method used gauged runoff values only (GAGE84; mean annual
   runoff = 83.3 cm) and the other used Water-Year 1984 mean regional
   runoff-to-precipitation ratios (MN84RP; mean annual runoff = 82.9 cm).
   Because of the over-generalized appearance of the GAGE84 map compared
   with the manual map, we preferred the MN84RP method.
   Next, we performed an uncertainty analysis for five of our eight
   procedures. In this analysis, we withheld gauged data in the production
   of the maps and then compared these data with interpolated values from
   the maps that were produced. The MN84RP procedure and a procedure using
   a regression approach (REG-R) had the lowest mean interpolation error.
   We determined that these two procedures, MN84RP and REG-R, produce the
   most accurate maps on a regional basis and compare favorably with the
   manual map (i.e. mean interpolation errors of -1.8\% and -0.7\% vs. the
   manual method mean error of 0.9\%).}},

   analysis of field and remotely sensed measurements and surface
   topography. Brightness temperature, surface soil water content and

   60 mm rain storm over a catchment in the Konza Prairie, Kansas.
   Microwave remote sensing was capable of measuring the overall drying

Abstract = {{Recent research has shown that enhanced acid deposition on to the
   canopies of commercial conifer forests in upland Wales has contributed
   to the release of Al into soil and stream waters. Relatively little is
   known about how soil hydrological and chemical processes interact in
   response to acid deposition and afforestation to regulate the transfer
   of Al-rich soil water into streams. A field-based hydrochemical study
   monitored the hydrology and soilwater chemistry of an afforested
   stagnopodzol at Llyn Brianne (Mid-Wales) during a hydrological year.
   Water moved vertically through the soil profile, aided by root-promoted
   macropores. Soil water fluxes, estimated by the LEACHM model, indicated
   that 89\% of effective precipitation drained vertically through the soil
   profile. Precipitation reaching the soil was acidified and enriched in
   anions during its passage through the forest canopy. Further
   acidification occurred as water moved into the soil and Al was
   mobilized, probably by cation exchange processes. Leaching losses of Al
   from the soil profile occurred during all major hydrological events and
   the total flux was estimated at 3.39 kmol(c) ha-1 year-1. It is
   suggested that Al-rich soil water draining from the base of the
   stagnopodzol profile can provide a significant input to streams during
   acid episodes.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has shown that storm runoff in afforested catchments at
   Llyn Brianne, Mid-Wales, is acidic and Al rich. However, relatively
   little is known about which hydrological pathways contribute to the
   generation of acid storm runoff. This paper reports the results of a
   year-long field investigation which examined the hydrological controls
   on stream water chemistry in a 1.5 ha subcatchment dominated by
   stagnopodzol and peat soils. During storm episodes, overland flow from
   the peat makes the dominant runoff contribution to the hydrological
   response of the subcatchment. This is strongly acidic (pH < 4.0) with a
   low Al content, though its interaction with the mineral lining of
   drainage channels results in the release of Al into surface waters. The
   stagnopodzols are characterized by vertical hydrological pathways;
   lateral flow occurs only above the bedrock, 1 m below the soil surface.
   In storm events, this flow path transfers acidic (pH 4.5), Al-rich soil
   water to streams. Drainage from the stagnopodzols also sustains base
   flows from the subcatchment. Almost 30\% of effective precipitation is
   lost from the subcatchment as seepage, mainly through the drift material
   lining forest drainage channels. Seepage losses to deeper flow paths
   appear to be important in headwater catchments in upland Wales and
   warrant further study.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of spatial variability of throughfall and stemflow were
   determined in a maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) stand for two
   consecutive years. Data were obtained from 52 fixed rain gauges and 12
   stemflow measuring devices located in a 50 m x 50 m plot at the centre
   of an 18-year-old stand. The pine trees had been sown in rows 4 m apart
   and had reached an average height of 12.6 m. The spatial distribution of
   stems had a negligible effect on the throughfall partitioning beneath
   the canopy. Variograms of throughfall computed for a sample of storms
   did not reveal any spatial autocorrelation of throughfall for the
   sampling design used. Differences in throughfall, in relation to the
   distance from the rows, were not consistently significant. In addition,
   the distance from the tree stem did not influence the amount of
   throughfall. The confidence interval on the amount of throughfall per
   storm was between 3 and 8\%. The stemflow was highly variable between
   trees. The effect of individual trees on stemflow was significant but
   the amount of stemflow per tree was not related to tree size (i.e.
   height, trunk diameter, etc.). The cumulative sampling errors on
   stemflow and throughfall for a single storm created a confidence
   interval of between +/- 7 and +/- 5 1\% on interception. This resulted
   mainly from the low interception rate and sampling error on throughfall.}},

Abstract = {{Interception, throughfall and stemflow were determined in an 18-year-old
   maritime pine stand for a period of 30 months. This involved 71 rainfall
   events, each corresponding either to a single storm or to several
   storms. Gash's analytical model of interception was used to estimate the
   sensitivity of interception to canopy structure and climatic parameters.
   The seasonal cumulative interception loss corresponded to 12.6-21.0\% of
   the amount of rainfall, whereas throughfall and stemflow accounted for
   77-83\% and 1-6\%, respectively. On a seasonal basis, simulated data
   fitted the measured data satisfactorily (r2 = 0.75). The rainfall
   partitioning between interception, throughfall and stemflow was shown to
   be sensitive to (1) the rainfall regime, i.e. the relative importance of
   light storms to total rainfall, (2) the climatic parameters, rainfall
   rate and average evaporation rate during storms, and (3) the canopy
   structure parameters of the model. The low interception rate of the
   canopy was attributed primarily to the low leaf area index of the stand.}},

Abstract = {{Dimensionless regional flood frequency curves use a number of records
   from a reasonably homogeneous area to overcome the variability of site
   records. The problems posed by short individual records and the
   variability of estimates are particularly acute in arid areas. Regional
   flood frequency curves in a number of semi-arid and arid areas have been
   assembled to illustrate their extreme slope and skewness, and the mutual
   similarity of these curves.
   Annual maxima from 162 stations with annual basin rainfall below 600 mm
   are assembled from NW Africa, Iran, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Botswana and
   South Africa, and compared with records from Australia, southwest USA
   and Russia. The general extreme value (GEV) curves from each region,
   fitted by probability weighted moments (PWM), are compared with the
   combined curve. Since floods in arid areas, if nowhere else, result from
   storm intensity exceeding soil infiltration, the similarity of regional
   flood curves may indicate similar storm characteristics in different
   regions.
   The mean annual flood (MAF) for each catchment has been related to both
   basin area and mean annual rainfall by regression in an attempt to
   provide a preliminary means of estimating the scaling factor, MAF, for
   catchments with no flow data. Whilst in many of the regions studied,
   insufficient data are currently available to permit reliable estimation
   of the MAF by such an approach, it is hoped that the regression
   equations presented may permit estimation of the MAF for Iran, Saudi
   Arabia and Yemen, Queensland and more tentatively South Africa and
   Botswana. In addition, a combined regression equation for all semi-arid
   and arid regions is presented. This combination of estimated MAF and
   regional flood frequency curves permits flood magnitude with a known
   risk of exceedance to be derived within arid zones of the world even
   where local flow data are unavailable.
   Specific problems associated with the analysis of flood records from
   arid areas include gauging problems and measurements, low or zero annual
   maxima in a number of years, and the suitability, or otherwise, of the
   mean annual flood as the appropriate scaling factor for the
   dimensionless curves. In some cases, the 5-year flood may be a more
   appropriate scaling factor.}},

Abstract = {{Monitored sequences of bedload transport events in two small
   gravel-bedded trout streams are described. To model the event timings,
   the inhomogeneous gamma process, with the special case of the Poisson
   process, are introduced, in which the baseline intensity is related to a
   linear regression combination of covariates. These may be time-varying
   covariates, such as seasonal cycles, covariates specific to an
   individual process or covariates common to more than one process. It is
   shown that the maximum likelihood estimates of the regression parameters
   may be obtained by an iterative least-squares procedure. The procedure
   is demonstrated by application to the bedload transport event sequences.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development and application of a new
   methodology to solve the failure of the disaggregation model. Based on
   the concept of aggregation, the parameters of the annual model are
   estimated from the parameters of the periodic model fitted to the
   seasonal series. Covariance estimates required in the parameter
   estimation procedure of the disaggregation model are calculated based on
   the derived annual model and the fitted periodic model. The covariance
   estimates are used in conjunction with the moment equations of the
   disaggregation model to produce the parameters for this model. The
   proposed methodology provides a linkage between the aggregation and
   disaggregation approaches for hydrologic time-series simulations. Using
   this methodology, the modelling in theory can preserve the additivity
   and many historical moments. The most significant advantage of this
   methodology over the existing remedies for the Mejia and Rousselle model
   is the preservation of over-year seasonal correlations.}},

Abstract = {{Southeastern Maine contains numerous small seepage lakes (no perennial
   surface inflows or outflows), set in felsic, glacial deposits (eskers,
   pitted outwash, glacio-marine deltaic terraces) dating from the
   Wisconsin glacial retreat ca. 12 500 years B.P. The modem landscape is
   either forested or maintained as low blueberry heath by semi-annual
   mowing and burning. Although local precipitation is currently moderately
   acidic (volume-weighted pH almost-equal-to 4.5), spring waters issuing
   from the glacial deposits are only weakly acidic (6.1 < pH < 7.0), and
   bicarbonate-buffered (I 20 to 300 mmol m-3) on account of tertiary
   weathering by dissolved CO2. The order of mobility (denudation rate) for
   base cations (BC) is: Ca > Na > Mg > K, the same as for upland granitic
   terrane in the same region. Springwater composition is temporally stable
   but geographically variable. The most dilute springwaters drain
   blueberry barrens. Here, chemical weathering is limited by available
   acidity as evidenced by the relatively high final pHs (> 6.3) and low
   concentrations of strong oxy-anions (nitrate, sulfate) and dissolved
   inorganic carbon (DIC < 250 muM). Closely neighboring lakes often range
   widely in alkalinity, BC, and F, depending on their connection to the
   local groundwater system. Tracer analysis indicates seepage inflow is
   equal to 5-50 cm year-1 for typical regional seepage lakes, vs. higher
   rates (> 100 cm year-1) for groundwater discharge lakes. Approximately
   88\% of Si inputs to regional seepage lakes is retained in the
   sediments. Non-marine sulfate is lowest in groundwater discharge lakes
   containing the highest concentrations of BC and F, and featuring the
   shortest hydraulic residence times, suggesting that S retention in lake
   sediments is currently less efficient than in the adjoining terrestrial
   soils and vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Subsurface brines are abundant in the Sichuan Basin, China. Five
   brine-bearing aquifers have been identified within rocks of Triassic age
   in the central part of the basin. These are of two types: brine-bearing
   clastic and brine-bearing carbonate aquifers. Brines in this region have
   high total dissolved solids and chemical species that are different from
   those of evaporatively concentrated seawater. Deep formation brines in
   clastic aquifers, in which evaporites do not exist, are characterized by
   high concentrations of Ca, Sr, Ba, Br and I, low concentrations of Mg
   and K, and lack of SO4, and are dominated by the Na-Ca-Cl type. Brines
   in carbonate aquifers, which have interbeds of evaporites, are
   characterized by high total dissolved solids, low concentrations of Ca,
   Mg and SO4, and lack of Ba, and are of the Na-Cl type. The brines in
   clastic aquifers originate from connate continental sedimentary waters
   mixed with marine waters; membrane filtration through shales has played
   an important part in modifying the chemical compositions and increasing
   the salinity of the brines. Those in carbonate aquifers are bittern
   marine sedimentary waters, with chemical compositions mainly controlled
   by precipitation of evaporites.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of an obstacle with maximum cross-sectional area has been
   analytically solved in terms of a model for 2-D seepage flow with a
   capillary fringe. The boundary of the obstacle appears to show a `blunt
   configuration', that is, the pressure reaches its maximum value at the
   vertex and decreases monotonically downstream. With a sufficiently large
   size of obstacle, a positive pressure domain in the form of a `bubble'
   is formed in the vicinity of its vertex. This result has been verified
   by computations for saturated-unsaturated flows in terms of the finite
   element method for the Richards equation. It has also been shown that an
   obstacle can transform the initial fully saturated flow into unsaturated
   flow inside the `dry shadow' domain. The shape of an obstacle in a
   confined aquifer that provides a minimum water head drop has been
   determined within the scope of the Dupuit model. A `critical cavity
   shape' has been found, i.e. a cavity for which the boundary is
   simultaneously an isobar and a stream line.}},

Abstract = {{Surface settlement in desert areas occurs in response to fluctuating
   groundwater levels. Model experiments have indicated a minor settlement
   as a result of rise and fall of water level and this is attributed to
   the readjustment of soil particles to a better packing condition as a
   result of suction forces. Deposition of salts within the pore spaces has
   been found to result in swelling of 0.5-1\% in medium-dense model
   samples, whereas dense samples showed a swelling of 4-8\%. The method of
   drying affected the results; oven drying gave greater swelling than
   drying by a hot air current. The type of precipitated salt was found to
   control the degree of swelling; calcium sulphate results in greater
   swelling than that caused by calcium carbonate, and the latter exceeds
   that induced by sodium chloride. The results of tests indicate that
   changing groundwater levels can cause surface settlement and/or heave
   related to the associated processes of salt precipitation and/or
   dissolution.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental results reveal that clay particles accumulate and form
   structures on the gas-liquid interface that appears in porous media
   during water evaporation. The structures can extend over one or more
   pore throats and impair further flow of fluids. During evaporation, the
   interparticle distance decreases as the area of the liquid-gas interface
   diminishes, and the dissolved salt concentration in the liquid
   increases. Under these circumstances, a phase separation process occurs,
   during which the particle-built structures become immobilized and the
   liquid retreats. This process may occur several times. In sandy
   sediments, the structures reduced flow by 10-85\%, depending on the
   mineralogical composition of the sediment, presence of entrapped
   gas-bubbles, and the history of flow. Such structures may be created,
   for example, at the contact between the saturated and unsaturated zones
   of aquifers.}},

   fluid flow in fissured media. Assuming a non-integer flow dimension,
   that analogy can be used to characterize a fissured medium by parameters
   that are similar to those describing a porous reservoir, if at least two
   observation wells are available, and if flow involves a sufficient
   number of fractures. The flow system behaves as a fractal object. With
   observation wells located along axes in several directions, anisotropy
   can be characterized. Two field applications illustrate the proposed
   method.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying water movement through bedrock materials requires a
   technique which can accurately measure water content at precise
   locations within the medium. Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) is widely
   used to measure the water content of soil and has a measurement
   sensitivity which is tightly confined to the area immediately
   surrounding the probes. This study applies TDR to the measurement of
   water content in rocks. The technique was evaluated using sandstone and
   welded tuff in a series of laboratory experiments. A block of each rock
   type was instrumented with a series of evenly spaced TDR probes. Each
   block was first saturated with water and then allowed to air dry. The
   water content was determined gravimetrically using the TDR over a period
   of several weeks. The results indicate that the TDR technique can be
   used to determine the water content of rock with an accuracy comparable
   with that reported for the technique used in soils.}},

Abstract = {{Rainfall was collected in central Pennsylvania from 33 storms during
   autumn 1989 and spring 1990. The variability of O-18 content among 33
   storms and within 10 storms is described and also examined in terms of
   weather type (air mass source and frontal activity) and storm
   characteristics (rainfall amount, intensity and duration). From storm to
   storm, the O-18 content expressed as deltaO-18 varied greatly (+2.79 to
   -24.65 parts per thousand), but showed greatest variability for the
   smaller rainstorms with low intensities. Also, O-18 depletion was
   greatest for storms of Atlantic (-10.9 parts-per thousand) vs. Gulf
   (-6.2 parts per thousand) origin. Within a storm, the O-18 content
   varied greatly, but usually was depleted as the storm continued. For one
   storm, the deltaO-18 decreased from -4.00 to -20.00 parts per thousand
   over a 10 h span of continuous rainfall. The most rapid changes in
   deltaO-18 (2-6 parts per thousand h-1) within a storm occurred mostly
   during storm intervals characterized by rapidly increasing rainfall
   intensities associated with moderate to high rainfall rates (more than 5
   mm h-1). When these bursts occurred within longer storms, the most rapid
   changes in O-18 content were associated with the higher rainfall
   intensities.}},

   result of lining of canals. A finite element program was developed to
   incorporate all the flow domain conditions of the canal-phreatic aquifer

Abstract = {{A hydrochemical and environmental isotope investigation was conducted in
   the Nile Delta and adjacent desert fringes within the framework of a
   routine hydrogeological mapping project. The aim of the study was to
   obtain additional insight into the historical groundwater flow pattern,
   to differentiate between fossil ground water and contemporaneous
   recharge by Nile water. An inventory of existing chemical analyses was
   made (252 data.points) and an additional 27 new samples were taken,
   which were also analysed for stable isotope (deltaO-18 and deltaH-2)
   content and, for nine samples, C-14 and tritium.
   In the majority of analyses, irrespective of total salinity, an
   enrichment in sodium was observed relative to the concentration
   resulting from direct mixing of Nile water with seawater. The Na-rich
   water is thought to have originated in the extreme arid period from
   14000 to 10000 years B.P. (last phase of the Weichsel glaciation) in
   which, by direct evaporation of (scarce) rain, trona minerals were
   formed at the surface, and the ground water in phreatic aquifers
   gradually became saline. The succeeding humid phase from 8000 to 5000
   years B.P. when sea-level was relatively high, caused freshening on the
   desert fringes only, because the Delta floodplain was covered by clay.
   The present arid phase, which started at around 3500 years B.P., also
   marked the start of widespread floodplain irrigation. Groundwater levels
   on the desert fringes dropped as a result of both aquifer depletion by
   discharge to the Qattara Depression in the west and climatic effects.
   This in tum initiated a freshening process in the Quaternary and Moghra
   aquifer of the Delta. Nile water has since then reached Wadi Natrun, 55
   km to the west of the western floodplain border.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were conducted to study the biodegradation of a
   nonionic alcohol ethoxylate surfactant by native microbes from a
   contaminated site. Three sets of experiments consisting of 13 microcosms
   were carried out to evaluate the rate of biodegradation and the effect
   of nutrients and supplementary oxygen on the degradation process. The
   results from these active microcosms were compared with those for
   controlled microcosms in which a biocide was added to inhibit biological
   activities. In the presence of ground water and sterilized soil,
   surfactant solutions with initial concentrations of 1000, 650, 250, and
   180 mg l-1 were reduced to less than 5 mg l-1 in 36 days, 20 days, 17
   days, and 17 days, respectively. The biodegradation rate in microcosms
   with added nutrients was more than twice the rate in the reactor without
   nutrients. The results from experiments in which various nitrogen and
   phosphorus nutrients were added showed that a ratio of 10 carbon:2
   nitrogen:1 phosphorus was the optimum for the biodegradation of
   surfactant under the microcosm conditions. The addition of 5 mg l-1 of
   oxygen in the form of hydrogen peroxide increased the degradation rate
   of surfactant by 30\%. The study showed that microbes indigenous to the
   soil and ground water at a contaminated site rapidly degrade the low
   levels of the surfactant that may remain at the site after soil washing,
   and that the degradation rate can be increased by the addition of
   nutrients and oxygen.}},

Abstract = {{The equations applied to the calculation of groundwater flow velocity
   and hydraulic age are based on assumptions that are frequently
   invalidated or not satisfactorily met by actual field conditions.
   Problem areas that account for significant errors in the calculated
   values of groundwater flow velocity and age include: (1) poorly defined
   hydraulic variables; (2) lack of single recharge and discharge areas;
   (3) extremely small or nonexistent discharge areas and entrapment of
   ground water in `dead' volumes in deep confined systems; (4) topographic
   and geologic controls affecting the flow path; (5) fractures/conduits
   affecting groundwater flow in supposed homogeneous porous media; (6)
   concealed structural and lithological barriers; (7) mixing of ground
   water of various ages; (8) slow hydraulic response to climatic or
   geologic changes. Checks based on physical, chemical, and isotopic data
   are advocated as a means to validate the basic assumptions used for
   calculating groundwater flow velocity and age. Hydraulic and
   isotopically determined groundwater ages provide essential and
   complementary hydrologic information. Both ages have to be computed with
   the utmost care, and the validity of the basic premises in each case
   study must be checked.}},

   Sampling variances of three-parameter 100-year flood estimators can be

   distributions with realistic shape parameters, the two-parameter

   a Gumbel estimator) generally has a smaller m.s.e. than does a
   three-parameter estimator, even if the shape parameter is
   misrepresented. On the other hand, for less extreme quantiles with

Abstract = {{Isotope data (tritium and O-18) for rivers and ground water, acquired
   since 1968, are combined with geological, hydrological and hydrochemical
   evidence to determine sources and flow patterns of ground water in
   gravel aquifers of the Wairau coastal plain and its southern tributary
   valleys. Determination of the components of groundwater origin depends
   on a strong west-east gradient of O-18 concentration between mountain
   catchment precipitation feeding rivers flowing to the Plain and
   rainwater falling directly on the Plain. The main aquifer is postglacial
   alluvial material deposited by Wairau River, deriving its water from
   that river; locally infiltrated precipitation contributes at most only a
   few percent to the flow in the shallowest gravels downstream of the
   infiltration zone. In the south of the Plain, the unconfined aquifer
   comprises material deposited during the last glaciation; its ground
   water has both local precipitation and inflow from southern tributary
   streams as appreciable sources. The main aquifer is confined near the
   coast. where it is overlain by up to 60 m of marine sediments deposited
   during postglacial marine transgression and subsequent coastal
   progradation. Tritium concentrations show that ground water in the
   shallowest geological stratum (Rapaura gravels) reaches the confined
   zone boundary less than 1 year after recharge from the river, with much
   shallow flow being discharged at the surface just upstream of the
   boundary; in contrast, ground water in the underlying unit (Speargrass
   gravels) requires at least 10 years to reach this point. Analysis of
   tritium concentrations in the confined zone shows a central zone through
   which the faster-flowing Rapaura component dominates as far as the
   coast, but also areas to the north and south where ground water in the
   Rapaura gravels has a dominant older component. The combined evidence
   reveals that the confined ground water is leaking into the overlying
   sediments, allowing water to flow from the lower Speargrass gravels into
   the Rapaura gravels. Because Wairau River is the dominant source of
   ground water for the main aquifer, its response to bomb-tritium input to
   its mountain catchments is given detailed consideration. Much of the
   river water derives promptly from bare catchment areas, but the analysis
   suggests that about 50\% is retained for about 8 years on average before
   release to the river. Large deposits of scree in higher-lying, formerly
   glacial catchments appears to be the major factor in the surprisingly
   large quantity of stored water implied by this result.}},

Abstract = {{A neural network is developed to forecast rainfall intensity fields in
   space and time; it is a three-layer learning network with input, hidden,
   and output layers. Training is conducted using back propagation where
   the input and output rainfall fields are presented to the neural network
   as a series of learning sets. After training is complete, the neural
   network is used to forecast rainfall intensity fields with a lead time
   of 1 h using only the current field as input. Rainfall fields are
   generated using a space-time mathematical rainfall simulation model, and
   forecasted fields are compared with the perfectly known model-produced
   fields. Results indicate that a neural network is capable of learning
   the complex relationship describing the space-time evolution of rainfall
   such as that inherent in a complex rainfall simulation model. One hour
   ahead forecasts are produced, and comparisons with true mean areal
   intensities and percent areal coverage indicate that in most cases the
   method performs well when applied to the events used in training. The
   neural network is used to forecast a series of events not included in
   the training data and is shown to perform well when a relatively large
   number of hidden nodes are utilized. Performance of the neural network
   is compared with two other methods of short-term forecasting,
   persistence and nowcasting.}},

Abstract = {{Perforated draintubes have, in many places, supplanted the use of
   draintiles in drainage systems of agricultural lands, airports,
   structural foundations, etc. This indicates that there is a need to
   obtain analytical solutions of the drainage flow rate for perforated
   draintubes. By using a series solution of Laplace's equation and
   techniques of solution of dual trigonometric series, a formula for the
   flow rate into a draintube buried in a water-saturated soil medium is
   developed. The flow rate into a draintube depends on numerous
   characteristics such as the hole size, the number and spacing of holes,
   the drain size and depth. Graphs showing the variation in delivery ratio
   with respect to geometric characteristics of draintubes are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of avalanche snow transport on snowmelt runoff is
   investigated in a large basin (2500 km2) in the Punjab Himalaya,
   Pakistan. The results of modelling based on field measurements show
   that, of the two main changes occurring during avalanching which affect
   the subsequent generation of snowmelt runoff-concentration of the snow
   and an ambient temperature increase resulting from the avalanches' fall
   to a lower elevation the former is dominant on most avalanche paths. As
   a result, very high rates of surficial melting on avalanche snow are
   outweighed by the small surface area of the deposits, significantly
   decreasing the rate of meltwater production and delaying the
   disappearance of avalanche snow compared with undisturbed snow. The
   length of the delay is difficult to estimate accurately but is of the
   order of two to three months on large avalanche paths. Calculations of
   the volume of avalanche snow in the basin indicate that, following a
   winter of maximum avalanche activity, such snow represents about 8 and
   6\% of the snowmelt runoff and annual runoff, respectively. In normal
   years these proportions are of the order of 1-2\% and may still be
   exceptional for a basin of this size.}},

Abstract = {{The overall shape of freshwater lenses can be determined by applying
   electromagnetic methods and inverse layered-earth modeling to the
   mapping of atoll island freshwater lenses. Conductivity profiles were
   run across the width of the inhabited islands at Mwoakilloa, Pingelap,
   and Sapwuahfik atolls of the Pohnpei State, Federated States of
   Micronesia using a dual-loop, frequency-domain, electromagnetic
   profiling system. Six values of apparent conductivity were recorded at
   each sounding station and were used to interpret layer conductivities
   and/or thicknesses. A three-layer model that includes the unsaturated,
   freshwater, and saltwater zones was used to simulate
   apparent-conductivity data measured in the field.
   Interpreted results were compared with chloride-concentration data from
   monitoring wells and indicate that the interface between freshwater and
   saltwater layers, defined from electromagnetic data, is located in the
   upper part of the transition zone, where the chloride-concentration
   profile shows a rapid increase with depth. The electromagnetic method
   can be used to interpret the thickness of the freshwater between
   monitoring wells, but can not be used to interpret the thickness of
   freshwater from monitoring wells to the margin of an island.}},

Abstract = {{The results of a 6 year recharge study in the Great Bend Prairie of
   central Kansas are statistically analyzed to regionalize the limited
   number of site-specific but year-round measurements. Emphasis is placed
   on easily measured parameters and field-measured data. The results of
   the statistical analysis reveal that a typical recharge event in central
   Kansas lasts 5-7 days, out of which 3 or 4 days are precipitation days
   with total precipitation of almost-equal-to 83 mm. The maximum
   soil-profile water storage and the maximum groundwater level resulting
   from the recharge event exhibit the lowest coefficients of variation,
   whereas the amount of recharge exhibits the highest coefficient of
   variation. The yearly recharge in the Great Bend Prairie ranged from 0
   to 177 mm with a mean of 56 mm. Most of the recharge events occur during
   the months of April, May, and June, which coincide with the months of
   highest precipitation in the region. A multiple regression analysis
   revealed that the most influential variables affecting recharge are, in
   order of decreasing importance, total annual precipitation, average
   maximum soil-profile water storage during the spring months, average
   shallowest depth to water table during the same period, and spring
   rainfall rate. Classification methods, whereby relatively homogeneous
   hydrologic-unit areas based on the four recharge-affecting variables are
   identified, were combined with a Geographic Information Systems
   (ARC/INFO) overlay analysis to derive an area-wide map of differing
   recharge regions. This recharge zonation is in excellent agreement with
   the field-site recharge values. The resulting area-weighted average
   annual recharge for the region is 36 mm.}},

Abstract = {{Two solutions to the problem of groundwater flow to partially
   penetrating wells are presented. The first solution is the well-known
   and widely used Hantush modification of the Theis method. The second is
   based on the author's recent work; it consists of a matching procedure
   between the drawdowns observed in the field and the theoretical
   drawdowns found from the analysis. This solution is only possible when
   specially developed software is used.
   Both solutions are described and compared with a theoretical data set.
   The comparison reveals important sensitivities in the estimate of the
   thickness of the tested aquifer. The author is of the opinion that the
   application of the Theis-Hantush method may lead to a serious
   overestimate of the aquifer thickness. These sensitivities are also
   illustrated using data from a field test in Pakistan.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrate concentrations beyond the drinking-water limit of 10 mg l-1
   NO3-N, are common in Australian arid-zone ground waters and are often
   associated with otherwise potable waters. In some aquifers nitrate-N
   concentrations of up to 80 mg l-1 have been found, and this is a severe
   constraint on water supply development for small settlements. Water-bore
   data indicate a correlation of high-nitrate ground waters with shallow
   unconfined aquifers. Aquifer hydrochemistry indicates that these ground
   waters were emplaced by episodic Holocene recharge events in an
   otherwise arid climate regime. Nitrate has been flushed through the
   unsaturated zone which apparently lacks denitrification activity. The
   nitrate originates by near-surface biological fixation and contributing
   organisms include cyanobacteria in soil crusts and bacteria in termite
   mounds with the highest soil nitrate concentrations found in the outer
   skin of termite mounds. Bacteria associated with the termites appear to
   fix nitrogen, which eventually appears in an inorganic form, principally
   as ammonia. Nitrate is produced by bacterial oxidation of the ammonia,
   and is leached to the outside of the termite mound by capillary action.
   Diffuse recharge from extreme rainfall events then flushes this nitrate
   to the water table.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the effects of parameter uncertainty on the
   simulation of recorded floods and design floods, using the HBV
   hydrological model. Two Swedish catchments with hydropower development
   were studied. A Monte Carlo procedure was used to generate parameter
   sets of different levels of uncertainty. The results showed that the
   most sensitive parameters in the calibration process were the snowfall
   correction factor and the recession parameters. Furthermore, when the
   model was extrapolated to simulate design flood and water stage
   hydrographs, the single most sensitive parameter was the highest
   recession coefficient. In addition, it was found that parameter
   uncertainty was associated with combinations of parameters rather than
   the absolute values of each.}},

Abstract = {{A 10 year record of streamflow from the 8 ha Martinelli Basin in the
   Colorado Front Range is dominated by snowmelt-produced flows. During the
   main part of the May-September flow season, the flows develop a marked
   24-h cycle which often accounts for more than 50\% of their variance,
   after removal of the seasonal trend. The amplitude and phase of this
   cycle vary in a similar fashion each year, showing a reduced amplitude
   and a forward phase shift as the summer progresses. These changes are
   explained by the reduction in the area of snow cover and its depth
   during the season. The phase shift may be used to estimate a
   catchment-scale hydraulic conductivity for a melting snow cover,
   yielding values in the range 40-80 cm h-1. These are consistent with
   other estimates based upon plot and laboratory studies.}},

   accumulation and ablation model, as well as the soil moisture accounting
   model are developed and tested for purposes of conceptually modelling a
   medium-size mountainous catchment, i.e. the Mesochora catchment in
   Central Greece, by using incomplete precipitation and temperature daily
   records. A combinatorial technique of the Thiessen method and station
   availability condition, including elevation correction, is adopted for
   areal and elevation integration of snowmelt model input data. For such
   an input modelling, the snowmelt model has been proved capable of
   predicting the initiation of snow accumulation in the fall and the
   gradual melting of the snowpack in the late winter and spring, while the
   rainfall-runoff model, which accepts as input the snowmelt model output
   `rain plus melt', has also proved capable of accurately reproducing both
   the magnitude and timing of the annual and monthly runoff. On a daily
   basis, the runoff model reproduces satisfactorily the historic data,
   while some discrepancies arise owing to antecedent dry conditions and
   extreme rainfalls.}},

Abstract = {{In Japan, many sloping fields are being reclaimed by the Ministry of
   Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to increase the upland field areas.
   To predict the flood discharge from these fields, a study was undertaken
   from one reclaimed sloping field, in the Hiroshima prefecture, with an
   area of 4.55 ha. For modelling purposes, the widely used kinematic wave
   equations and method of characteristics were used. Rainfall and runoff
   data were collected for a period of 6 years (1984-1989) from the field,
   for both furrow and non-furrow conditions and were used in these
   analyses. Manning, Darcy and laminar resistance equations were used and
   Manning's equation was found to be the best of the three. Manning's
   roughness coefficient (n) for furrow flow and equivalent roughness (N)
   for non-furrow flow conditions were determined and are presented in
   tabular form.
   Application of the non-furrow flow equation to the furrow flow condition
   required selecting an adequate equivalent roughness. Finally,
   verification of time of concentration, velocity of sheet or furrow flow
   and runoff coefficient were made both for furrow and non-furrow
   conditions, and these are graphically presented.}},

Abstract = {{The paper examines a system of two discrete stochastic reservoirs in
   series, and a system of two in parallel. In the `series' case, the
   downstream reservoir is fed not only by an inflow from its own catchment
   but also (after the necessary transit time lag a) by the controlled
   release plus the overflow from the upstream facility. If the inflow
   processes to the two reservoirs from their respective catchments are
   independent of one another, the pair (Z(t-a), Z(t)') of water levels in
   the two constituents form a bivariate Markov chain, the transition
   probabilities of which are derived. The joint equilibrium distribution
   of the two storage variables then requires the solution of (c + 1)(c' +
   1) simultaneous linear algebraic equations, where c, c' are the
   capacities of the two reservoirs. The final yield and spillage
   distributions follow directly from those of the storages. If, however,
   the inflow processes are both Markovian, defined on the values 0, 1,
   ..., d and 0, 1, ..., d' respectively, the number of equations to be
   solved increases to the impracticable level of (c + 1) (c' + 1)(d +
   1)(d' + 1).
   In the `parallel' case, each reservoir receives its own inflow process,
   and in each the release is controlled by both storage levels. The two
   yields are then combined. If the inflow processes are mutually
   independent we find that (Z(t), Z(t)') is bivariate Markov; if, instead,
   they are themselves Markovian, one has to work in terms of the
   quadrivariate Markov process (Z(t), Z(t)', X(t), X(t)'), with
   consequences for the number of equations to be solved as in the `series'
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in the concentrations of beryllium in rainfall, throughfall,
   stemflow, mist and stream waters are presented for an acidic and
   acid-sensitive UK upland environment. The streams drain moorland,
   afforested moorland and a deforested area. Beryllium concentrations are
   typically less than 0.06-mu-g l-1 in rainfall; concentrations in
   stemflow and throughfall are also relatively low, albeit two to three
   times higher than those in rainfall owing to the ability of the trees to
   enhance dry and mist deposition and to cycle chemicals. In contrast to
   rainfall, stemflow and throughfall, mist has a much higher beryllium
   concentration (0.36-mu-g l-1). The beryllium input to the catchments is
   derived, essentially, from industrial emissions. The total beryllium
   deposition on both the moorland and forested areas is estimated to be
   about 20-mu-g m-2 year-1. Of this figure, about 3-mu-g m-2 year-1 is
   estimated to have been derived from mist and dry deposited materials.
   However, uncertainty remains regarding the contribution from the
   atmosphere of dry and mist deposited materials: the atmospheric
   deposition of beryllium may well be higher than that quoted in this
   paper. Average beryllium concentrations in the streams are higher than
   those in rainfall. Beryllium concentrations range from less than 0.01 to
   0.05-mu-g l-1 for the moorland stream, from less than 0.01 to 0.18-mu-g
   l-1 for the streams draining the forested catchment and from less than
   0.01 to 0.25-mu-g l-1 for the stream draining the deforested catchment.
   About 52\% of the beryllium flux associated with the moorland stream is
   accounted for by the rainfall input. This compares with lower values for
   streams draining forested (18\%) and deforested (14\%) areas.
   Concentrations of beryllium in the streams are highly correlated with
   flow: from base to moderate flows, concentrations increase sharply; at
   higher flows, concentrations either remain constant or decrease
   slightly. The beryllium concentrations are also strongly correlated with
   total aluminium concentrations. These results are explained in terms of
   the mixing of acidic and aluminium-bearing soil water with less-acidic
   aluminium-deficient, bicarbonate-bearing, ground water, as well as
   chemical processes in the stream or near stream areas. It is proposed
   that the beryllium is released from the aluminium-rich layers in the
   soil. The beryllium concentrations encountered do not pose a problem to
   stream ecology and water supplies in the Plynlimon area. However,
   problems may well occur in areas of the UK with either greater
   industrialisation or with beryllium-enriched bedrock. The potential of
   the vegetation to enhance capture of beryllium from mist and particulate
   materials is highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic depth sounding provides useful and unexpected information
   about peak discharge and sediment transport when applied during storm
   flow in channels with erodible beds. Streambed elevation was measured
   with dual ultrasonic depth sounders during the rise, crest, and
   recession of a storm flow in the North Fork Toutle River, Washington, on
   3 December 1987. The sounder transducers were held in the flow on a
   rigid pipe which was suspended from a boom over the channel thalweg. The
   12 h episode of depth sounding detected the superposition of fine-gravel
   dunes on large bed waves, the depth-limited growth of mean dune heights
   from 13 to 25 cm, and bedform-related deposition and erosion in the
   channel thalweg. The streambed elevation rose 0.3 m in 2 h with
   increasing stream discharge. Dune heights diminished for about an hour
   before the peak river stage was attained. Scour of the streambed
   continued through the peak stage and recession, with 0.7 m of scour over
   10 h. Rapid scour of the streambed produced a falling stage while
   discharge was still rising. Dune heights grew as flow depth increased
   after peak stage. Streambed elevation was lowered as large bed waves of
   fine gravel migrated along the thalweg with successively lower troughs
   leading each bed wave.
   Bed elevation records from the dual depth sounders were used to
   calculate dune celerities of 3-6 cm s-1 and bedform wavelengths of 2-11
   m. The large bed waves were subtle, dune-like gravel bedforms with
   wavelengths of 25-30 m. The celerities and bedform dimensions yielded
   bedform transport weight rates between 3 and 20 kg s-1 m-1 and grain
   shear stresses between 40 and 100 N m-2  for the depth-sounding episode.}},

Abstract = {{A new and efficient mini slug test method for the determination of local
   hydraulic conductivities in unconfined sandy aquifers is developed. The
   slug test is performed in a small-diameter (1 inch) driven well with a
   0.25 m screen just above the drive point. The screened drive point can
   be driven from level to level and thereby establish vertical profiles of
   the hydraulic conductivity. The head data from the test well are
   recorded with a 10 mm pressure transducer, and the initial head
   difference required is established by a small vacuum pump. The method
   described has provided 274 spatially distributed measurements of a local
   hydraulic conductivity at a tracer test site at Vejen, Denmark. The mini
   slug test results calculated by a modified Dax slug test analysing
   method, applying the elastic storativity in the Dax equations instead of
   the specific yield, are in good accordance with the results from two
   natural gradient tracer experiments performed at the test site. The
   original Dax, the Bouwer and Rice, and the Chirlin analysing methods all
   led to an underestimation of the effective hydraulic conductivity by a
   factor of more than 2, when compared with the tracer tests. In contrast
   the spherical flow model of Karasaki et al. overestimated the results of
   the tracer tests by approximately a factor 1.4. The Dax and the Cooper
   et al. methods, assuming only radial flow to the partially screened
   well, yielded a better approximation of the horizontal hydraulic
   conductivity, than the Chirlin method, which also considers axial flow.
   This fact is suggested to be a result of aquifer anisotropy, as a
   significant higher horizontal than vertical hydraulic conductivity may
   Suppress the significance of the axial flow component.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial variability of the hydraulic conductivity in a sandy aquifer
   has been determined by a mini slug test method. The hydraulic
   conductivity (K) of the aquifer has a geometric mean of 5.05 x 10(-4) m

   quite well to the results obtained by two large scale tracer experiments
   performed in the aquifer. A geological model of the aquifer based on 31
   sediment cores, proposed three hydrogeological layers in the aquifer
   concurrent with the vertical variations observed with respect to
   hydraulic conductivity. The horizontal correlation length of the
   hydraulic conductivity has been determined for each of the three
   hydrogeological layers and is found to be small (1-2.5 m). The
   asymptotic longitudinal dispersivity of the aquifer has been estimated
   from the variance in hydraulic conductivity and the horizontal
   correlation length, to be in the range of 0.3-0.5 m compared with a
   value of 0.42 m obtained in one of the tracer tests performed.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrologic and solute budgets of a lake can be strongly influenced
   by transient groundwater flow. Several shallow interdunal lakes in
   southwest Spain are in close hydraulic connection with the shallow
   ground water. Two permanent lakes and one intermittent lake have
   chloride concentrations that differ by almost an order of magnitude. A
   two-dimensional solute-transport model, modified to simulate transient
   groundwater-lake interaction, suggests that the rising water table
   during the wet season leads to local flow reversals toward the lakes.
   Response of the individual lakes, however, varies depending on the
   lake's position in the regional flow system. The most dilute lake is a
   flow-through lake during the entire year; the through flow is driven by
   regional groundwater flow. The other permanent lake, which has a higher
   solute concentration, undergoes seasonal groundwater flow reversals at
   its downgradient end, resulting in complex seepage patterns and higher
   solute concentrations in the ground water near the lake. The solute
   concentration of the intermittent lake is influenced more strongly by
   the seasonal wetting and drying cycle than by the regional flow system.
   Although evaporation is the major process affecting the concentration of
   conservative solutes in the lakes, geochemical and biochemical reactions
   influence the concentration of nonconservative solutes. Probable
   reactions in the lakes include biological uptake of solutes and calcite
   precipitation; probable reactions as lake water seeps into the aquifer
   are sulfate reduction and calcite dissolution. Seepage reversals can
   result in water composition that appears inconsistent with predictions
   based on head measurements because, under transient flow conditions, the
   flow direction at any instant may not satisfactorily depict the source
   of the water. Understanding the dynamic nature of groundwater-lake
   interaction aids in the interpretation of hydrologic and chemical
   relations between the lakes and the ground water.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1980 and 1989, samples of bulk precipitation, soil water and
   stream water have been collected regularly from a small catchment within
   the headwaters of the River Wye at Plynlimon. Subsequent analysis for
   nitrate-N and ammonium-N revealed that ammonium-N was present in bulk
   precipitation but concentrations were below detection limit ( < 0.1 mg
   l-1 N) in soil waters and streamwaters. Over the 10 year period, no
   consistent trends were observed in the concentration or wet deposition
   of inorganic nitrogen compounds. Between 1980 and 1983, soil water
   nitrate-N concentrations varied irregularly over time, in contrast to
   the regular pattern of summer minima and winter maxima observed in the
   stream. Following the dry summer of 1984, large increases in soil water
   nitrate-N concentrations were observed in the stream such that during
   1985, winter maximum concentrations increased by a factor of two and
   summer minima by a factor of ten as compared with previous years. Winter
   maxima declined gradually over the following 3 years to values similar
   to those prior to 1984. The variations in streamwater nitrate
   concentration are discussed in relation to the processes controlling
   nitrate supply from the catchment and nitrogen depletion within the
   stream channel. The significance of inorganic nitrogen deposition at
   Plynlimon is discussed on the basis of streamwater nitrate-N data from
   an adjacent headwater catchment and a simple mass balance comparing wet
   deposition of inorganic nitrogen compounds with nitrate exports in the
   stream. Although nitrate leaching losses vary between 4 and 5 kg ha-1
   year-1, there is a net retention of inorganic nitrogen within the
   catchment. The mass balance also indicates that nitrogen transformations
   within the catchment may generate an average of 0.34 kEq H+ ha-1 year-1.}},

Abstract = {{Okefenokee Swamp, located in southeastern Georgia and northeastern
   Florida, is one of the largest freshwater wetland complexes and a
   National Wildlife Refuge in the United States. A low earthen dam, the
   Suwannee River Sill, was built on the largest outlet stream of
   Okefenokee Swamp in the early 1960s. The purpose was to raise the water
   level and thus reduce fire frequency in this National Wildlife Refuge.
   In this study, hydrologic conditions in the swamp prior to (1937-62) and
   after (1963-86) sill construction were compared by statistical
   procedures. An average 9 cm increase in swamp water level at the
   Suwannee Canal Recreation Area was attributed to the sill. Increased
   precipitation and decreased evapotranspiration during the study period
   caused another 5 cm increase in water levels. Seasonal changes in
   climatic factors were also responsible for seasonal changes in water
   levels and streamflow in the pre- and post-sill periods. Although the
   effect of the sill on water level was more significant during dry
   periods, it is doubtful that the Suwannee River Sill actually prevented
   occurrence of severe fires in the post-sill period, which was wetter
   than the period before sill construction. The sill diverted 2.6\% of
   swamp outflow from the Suwannee River to the St. Mary's River. Diversion
   of flow was more marked during low flow periods. Therefore, the
   discharge of the St. Mary's River in the post-sill increased more than
   the discharge of the Suwannee River and its variability became lower
   than that of the Suwannee River. The relationships between swamp water
   level, streamflow and precipitation were also changed due to
   construction of the sill.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted to measure evaporation at high elevations on
   a tropical island mountain and to compare these measurements with
   estimates from Penman, Penman-Van Bavel, Penman-Monteith, and
   Priestley-Taylor models. Hourly evaporation and other
   microclimatological data were measured at three sites on Haleakala,
   Maui, Hawaii. Evaporation during the observation period increased with
   elevation, averaging 3.3 mm day-1 at 950 m, 3.6 mm day-1 at 1650 m, and
   6.4 mm day-1 at 2130 m. The spatial pattern of evaporation on Haleakala
   is dominantly a function of elevation relative to the position of the
   inversion. The residual of measured minus modeled evaporation, as well
   as the ratio of evaporation to net radiation increased with elevation.
   The rate of night-time evaporation, also increasing with elevation,
   suggests a source of non-radiative energy. Results indicate that air
   above and within the inversion layer in the- Hawaiian Islands region
   provides a source of heat advection that substantially increases
   potential evaporation at high elevations.}},

Abstract = {{The mass balance equation was used to assess the contribution of water
   flowing from the solum (the upper 80 cm of soil) and subsoil to a
   first-order stream in the southern Laurentians, Quebec, during spring
   snowmelt. Dissolved reactive silicon was used as a tracer and showed
   that during high flow the solum contributed 50-95\% of the stream
   discharge. During low flow, the stream was mainly fed by ground water.
   Based on this hydrograph separation and soil solution chemistry, a
   simple model was developed to predict stream chemistry. The simulations
   obtained for calcium, sodium, sulphate, nitrate, chlorine, and
   electrical conductivity showed good agreement with the stream chemistry.
   The predicted values of hydrogen and total aluminium followed the same
   pattern as the measured values but overestimated concentrations in the
   stream during high flow due to their reactive, non-conservative
   behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Diffuse (evaporative) discharge of ground water is of interest in the
   management of local or regional ground waters, and soil salinity.
   However, past studies show that discharge may vary greatly between soils
   in agricultural areas and salt flats for similar water table depths. Low
   discharge from salt flats has been previously attributed to the effect
   of salt crusts, yet possible soil hydrological reasons for these
   differences have not been examined. Steady-state hydraulic theory
   describing the relationship between discharge and water table depth is
   reviewed. The minimum water table depths required for the theory to be
   applied are defined in terms of soil parameters. Relationships between
   discharge and water table depth are then used to analyse the results of
   previous diffuse discharge studies. It is shown that discharge from both
   bare agricultural soils and salt flats is consistent with this theory.
   Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of three salt flat soils, determined
   from measurements of discharge and soil matric suction, showed that low
   discharge fluxes recorded from the sites were due to low soil
   permeability. The relationship between discharge flux and water table
   depth calculated for these sites also described discharge from other
   salt flats, implying that low hydraulic conductivity caused low
   discharge from these areas as well. The reasons for the low hydraulic
   conductivity of salt flat soils are not clear, and need to be
   investigated to determine if it is a general property of soils in these
   areas, or results from the high salinity levels.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure to calculate the steady-state mass concentration, mass flux
   and transport rate of suspended blowing snow over continuous snowcovers
   has been coupled to extensive measurements of the mass flux of suspended
   snow. Theoretical modelling of the vertical diffusion of snow particles
   undergoing sublimation specifies that the suspended snow mass
   concentration is controlled by a dimensionless vertical velocity and the
   height of a reference concentration near the lower boundary of suspended
   flow. Whilst the result for short time scales is affected by variable
   boundary conditions (surface erosion, dune formation, snowfall), on a
   storm-event time scale only height, wind speed and surface roughness
   need be considered to calculate mass concentration. The development of
   an expression for mass flux and integrating it through the appropriate
   boundary layer provides a suspension transport model that may be
   implemented with standard meteorological service wind-speed
   measurements. The model indicates the transport rate of suspended snow
   increases approximately with the fourth power of the 10 m wind speed. As
   wind speed increases, suspended transport rates rapidly exceed those of
   saltating transport; suspension comprises over 90\% of total snow
   transport for wind speeds in excess of 17 m s-1. Application of the
   suspended blowing snow model using meteorological data will assist in
   determining snow redistribution and the over-winter hydrological balance
   of wind-swept, snow-covered catchments.}},

Abstract = {{In the Murray Basin in southeastern Australia, saline waste irrigation
   waters are often discharged to natural depressions and saline lakes as a
   salinity and land management strategy. At the Noora disposal basin in
   South Australia the waste irrigation water (EC = 17-19 dS m-1) has
   formed a lens in the top of the highly saline (50-80 dS m-1) regional
   groundwater (Parilla Sands) aquifer. Using salinity and environmental
   isotopes of water (deuterium and oxygen-18) the lens has been shown to
   extend about 500 m in a northwesterly direction from the disposal pond.
   The major effects of this lens have been: (1) to cause upwards
   displacement of the regional ground water over an area of about 285 km2,
   implying increased evaporation from areas surrounding the lens; (2) to
   reduce evaporation of regional ground water from the central low-lying
   area.
   Electromagnetic induction techniques for detecting preferred flowpaths
   away from the basin were rendered ineffective in this environment
   because of lithologic variations within the dune system. However,
   examination of bore-logs and groundwater gradients indicated that there
   was little evidence of stratigraphic control of mound development.
   Salinity in the Parilla Sands aquifer was closely related to the depth
   of the water table from the soil surface. Shallow (2-4 m) water tables
   were affected by recharge and evaporation to a much greater extent than
   ground water located below the higher dunes. There was, however, an
   almost instantaneous pressure response throughout the whole groundwater
   system to changes induced in the low-lying areas. Analyses of
   piezometric data showed that there was a seasonal variation imposed on
   the groundwater mound development. Corrected mean annual water-table
   increments and estimates of the mound volume and area were derived from
   a Theis response curve of the water table rise associated with the mound
   alone. Calculations using fitted parameters from the Theis analyses also
   suggested high transmissivity values, but are subject to uncertainties
   in limited data on specific yield.
   Although comparison of the mound volume and the disposed volume
   indicates extensive losses, isotopic and salinity data do not support
   substantial evaporation of the disposal water. However, them is that the
   already more saline regional waters are subject to increased evaporation
   in topographic lows which come within the influence of the elevated
   water table. Hence the problem to be faced in the future is the
   contamination of the River Murray system by Parilla Sands water rather
   than from waste water leaking laterally from the disposal basin. Results
   from this study show that the effect of disposal of the waste water is
   dominated by the density of the water relative to the regional waters.
   The assessment of the environmental impact of water disposal at other
   sites should, therefore, give careful consideration to this aspect,
   which is not adequately incorporated into groundwater models in current
   use.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates the implementation of a novel mathematical model
   to quantify subsurface inflows from various sources into the arid
   alluvial basin of the southern Arava Valley divided between Israel and
   Jordan. The model is based on spatial distribution of environmental
   tracers and is aimed for use on basins with complex hydrogeological
   structure and/or with scarce physical hydrologic information. However, a
   sufficient qualified number of wells and springs are required to allow
   water sampling for chemical and isotopic analyses. Environmental tracers
   are used in a multivariable cluster analysis to define potential sources
   of recharge, and also to delimit homogeneous mixing compartments within
   the modeled aquifer. Six mixing cells were identified based on 13
   constituents. A quantitative assessment of 11 significant subsurface
   inflows was obtained. Results revealed that the total recharge into the
   southern Arava basin is around 12.52 x 10(6) m3 year-1. The major source
   of inflow into the alluvial aquifer is from the Nubian sandstone aquifer
   which comprises 65-75\% of the total recharge. Only 19-24\% of the
   recharge, but the most important source of fresh water, originates over
   the eastern Jordanian mountains and alluvial fans.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation of the application of multivariate geostatistics for
   analysis of regional evapotranspiration is reported. The focus of the
   research was analysis and modeling of the spatial correlation between
   evapotranspiration and elevation above sea level. The main goal was to
   investigate whether the use of cokriging could improve the accuracy of
   evapotranspiration estimates over a regular grid by including elevation
   in the estimation procedure.
   A total of 11 study cases for each of four different climatic regions
   (Willamette Valley, North Central, South Central and East) within the
   state of Oregon were analyzed. Long-term monthly (February to November)
   averages of daily reference evapotranspiration (ET(r)) and values of
   annual ET(r) were available at 199 locations within the regions. Values
   of elevation were available at the 199 locations and at 8570 additional
   locations spaced at approximately 5 km intervals on a grid.
   Experimental direct- and cross-semivariograms were computed to describe
   the spatial variability of ET(r) and elevation, and their correlation.
   Experimental direct-semivariograms for ET(r) showed best fit with
   isotropic spherical models with small nugget effects. Experimental
   direct-semivariograms for elevation showed best fit with isotropic
   models with nugget effects and two nested structures (spherical and
   gaussian) for the Willamette Valley region, one structure (spherical)
   for the North Central region, and two nested structures (spherical and
   linear) for the South Central and East regions. The experimental
   cross-semivariograms showed best fit with isotropic spherical models.
   Monthly and annual ET(r) Values were estimated at 8570 locations
   situated at an approximately 5 km grid spacing using kriging and
   cokriging in conjunction with the previously fitted direct- and
   cross-semivariograms. Kriging and cokriging estimation error standard
   deviations were computed for each study case at all locations. ET(r)
   estimates and estimation error standard deviations were plotted as
   contour maps. Maximum, minimum and average kriging and cokriging
   estimates of ET(r) were in general agreement, although minimum and
   average values tended to be lower for cokriging. However, contour lines
   of cokriged ET(r) more closely reflected the elevation features of the
   climatic regions. Maximum and average estimation error standard
   deviations were lower for cokriging, although minimum values were very
   similar for both kriging and cokiriging.  Average cokriging standard
   deviations decreased by about 20-30\% in the Willamette Valley and North
   Central regions and by 5-13\% in the South Central and East regions.
   These differences between regions were due to the lower correlation
   coefficients between ET(r) and elevation observed in the latter two
   regions. Contour maps of standard deviations showed cokriging had a more
   uniform distribution of estimation errors than kriging, for which errors
   tended to decrease in the vicinity of the sample ET(r) points at the
   weather stations. Errors increased along regional borders for both
   kriging and cokriging, although maximum estimation error values were
   lower for cokriging.}},

Abstract = {{Immiscible multiphase flow in porous media is investigated by laboratory
   experiments and numerical simulations.
   The hydraulic parameters used in mathematical models for multiphase flow
   are determined experimentally, and the interrelations between the
   individual parameters are analysed. The experimental data support the
   applicability of analytical closed-form expressions for the constitutive
   relations, and a scaling procedure is verified in which the interfacial
   tensions are used to derive scaling factors. These simplifications in
   the parameter requirements are very valuable from an engineering point
   of view.
   A two-dimensional plexiglass flume is used for studying the flow of
   lighter-than-water, non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL) in sandy porous
   media, The migration of the LNAPL is observed both in the unsaturated
   zone and in the saturated zone at the bottom of the flume.
   A dual-gamma attenuation system is used for measuring the phase
   saturations of organic fluid, water, and air simultaneously without
   disturbing the flow. This permits a two-dimensional quantitative
   determination of the LNAPL plume in contrast to many earlier qualitative
   studies.
   A black oil reservoir model is used to simulate immiscible multiphase
   flow. By using the parameter estimation methods presented for
   establishing the constitutive relations, the model is applied to the
   simulation of the laboratory experiments. The experimental and numerical
   results compare reasonably well, thus supporting the adopted model
   formulation.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrometric and isotopic techniques were used to test the groundwater
   ridging hypothesis of streamflow generation during snowmelt in a
   forested catchment on the Canadian Shield. The catchment contains a
   central wetland that drains to an ephemeral channel. Hydrograph
   separation using H-2 as a tracer indicated that approximately 60\% of
   total stream flow during snowmelt was supplied by pre-event water. This
   was supported by hydrometric results. However, contrary to the
   groundwater ridging hypothesis, the response of water-table levels in
   near-stream areas to initial melt inputs failed to promote a rapid flux
   of ground water to the wetland and stream. All stream flow originated as
   saturation overland flow from the wetland, and groundwater flow during
   much of the melt was directed down the catchment's main axis and back
   under hillslopes surrounding the wetland and channel. Although the
   hydrograph separation indicated pronounced short-term variations in
   pre-event discharge from the catchment, groundwater fluxes to the
   wetland remained relatively invariant following initiation of surface
   saturation. Streamflow fluctuations appear to have been generated by
   displacement of water held in surface storage, induced by melt and
   rainwater inputs to the wetland. This stored water had an isotopic
   signature intermediate between that of event and pre-event water.
   Suggested oscillations in pre-event runoff were an artifact of the
   mixing model approach to hydrograph separation, rather than the result
   of rapid changes in groundwater fluxes to the wetland.}},

Abstract = {{Two infiltration experiments were conducted on two plots of 1 m2, each
   equipped with a neutron meter access tube and tensiometers. One
   infiltration was performed with a constant head of water maintained at
   the soil surface, the other using a rain simulator. The order of
   experiments was reversed on the two plots, i.e. on the first plot,
   simulated rain preceeded infiltration under constant head, while on the
   second plot, ponded infiltration was performed prior to the simulated
   rain. For each plot, the water pressure and hydraulic conductivity
   relationships versus water content were determined from both experiments
   for the various horizons of the soil profile. It is shown that the range
   of data obtained from the double ring infiltrometer is much wider than
   that corresponding to the rain simulator. This is due probably to
   surface sealing during the latter experiment. Application of the Van
   Genuchten model (1980) to predict the hydraulic conductivity from the
   water retention curve shows good agreement for some horizons but is not
   satisfactory for others. It is concluded that when the soil surface is
   subject to crusting, the double ring infiltrometer is more suitable than
   the rain simulator for the determination of soil hydrologic properties.,}},

   produced by warm southwesterly air flow over cold offshore water,
   although cooler northeasterly air is also important. Between 21 June and
   14 July 1989 fog deposition was 50\% of rainfall, averaging 1.8 mm
   day-1, with a maximum daily deposition of 10.2 mm. Evaporation was also
   restricted during fog and rain events; evaporation on days with fog or
   rain averaged < 1.1 mm, compared with 2.5 mm when it was not foggy or
   raining. The addition of water to the surface by fog, combined with low
   evaporation rates may be critical to the development of blanket bog in

Abstract = {{The water balance was calculated for a 9.4 ha blanket bog basin between
   5 and 28 July 1989, and between 16 May and 24 June 1990. Rainfall for
   these periods was 174 mm and 231 mm, respectively, and fog deposition
   added 31 mm and 23 mm of water to the inputs, respectively. Runoff was
   the largest loss, accounting for 70\% and 63\% of inputs in 1989 and
   1990, respectively, compared with 24\% and 28\% for evaporation, and 6\%
   for groundwater seepage. Fog simultaneously enhances the inputs and
   reduces the evaporative loss. Evaporation occurs at the potential rate
   for a very short period following fog, but decreases quickly as the
   surface dries, making it difficult to predict. Pipe-flow and high
   near-stream gradients, coupled with the high transmissivity of the
   elevated water table, produce a flashy hydrograph. The maritime climate
   maintains a high water table, despite relatively steep gradients, which
   is essential to the development of blanket bog systems in Newfoundland.}},

Abstract = {{Methylene blue staining patterns of five undisturbed unsaturated soil
   cores, 200 mm long and 200 mm in diameter, taken from a well-structured
   clay soil classified as a Hydric Fluvaquent, were characterized by using
   the fractal dimension of structure to predict measured bypass flow.
   Cumulative outflow curves in all cores were well described by a
   spherical model. Outflow in each core started after a significant time
   lag from the start of irrigation. Outflow rates during irrigation in all
   cores were almost equal to irrigation rates; nearly all the water
   applied, after outflow had started, contributed to bypass flow. Total
   outflow (O(m), mm) was regressed on the time lag (T1, min) as: O(m) =
   -0.181 T1 + 9.85. This time lag was caused by the effect of internal
   catchment of discontinuous macropores and surface storage. The
   three-dimensional fractal dimension of structure (D(s)3) was calculated
   for the upper and lower halves of the core, by using values of D(s)2 and
   stained area in cross-sections. A statistically significant empirical
   equation, relating the total amount of outflow (O(m)) to both upper and
   lower values of D(s)3 and to the volume fraction of stained parts (V(s))
   is: O(m) = -230.6(V(s)Ds3-1) upper + 232.4(V(s)Ds3-1) lower + 12.6 Thus,
   a greater D(s)3 value in the upper half of the core and a lower D(s)3
   value in the lower half of the core induce larger amounts of outflow:
   hence vertically continuous macropores, such as fragments of cracks or
   tubes, play a significant role in the process of bypass flow.}},

Abstract = {{Procedures for analysis of data from a hydrologic network usually assume
   that a collection schedule is fully followed. In practice, however, data
   are frequently missing (or simply unknown, in regions where measurements
   were not planned), and must be estimated on the basis of other available
   observations and information. During the 1980s a simple method to
   estimate missing data (e.g. on water levels) by use of a spatial
   approach was developed. Spatial and temporal variations of a measurable
   state variable (such as hydraulic head) were assumed to be described by
   a deterministic function, with randomness introduced by the choice of
   location and timing of observations. The function describes a spatial
   surface, and allows only for fluctuation parallel to itself along the
   time axis. Missing (or unknown) data can then be estimated from
   predicted surfaces. The constraint of parallel fluctuations has now been
   removed. The proposed method, which is more general, is based on
   integration of two sources of information: prior estimates and online
   estimates. It allows for continuous updating of the function as
   additional information becomes available, and as a consequence, missing
   (or unknown) data can be more accurately estimated.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure for determining Manning's roughness coefficients from small
   field plots receiving simulated rainfall is presented. The procedure
   determines detention storage by hydrograph analysis and employs
   Manning's resistance equation to obtain effective Manning's roughness
   coefficients from field plots under different management practices. To
   validate the hydrograph analysis method, Manning's roughness
   coefficients and data of infiltration rate, obtained by the hydrograph
   analysis method, were used as inputs to the kinematic wave equation.
   Runoff hydrographs thus predicted, compared with observed runoff
   hydrographs, indicated that the hydrograph analysis method provides
   accurate determination of infiltration rate and of effective Manning's
   roughness coefficients; it also accounts for surface routing of runoff
   over small field plots.}},

Abstract = {{Winter profile development was studied comparatively in two basins
   (z(max) = 14 m) separated by a 6 m sill in Shagawa Lake, Minnesota.
   Based on physical arguments and profile measurements, heat and solutes
   released from shelf sediments in the western basin cause convective
   instability at 8-11 m. After a mid-winter interval of instability, radon
   profiles indicate very low rates of vertical mixing in the benthic
   boundary layers following their stabilization by ferrous iron. Because
   of hydrographic features, two types of plunging inflows sometimes enter
   the western basin in late winter; one anthropogenic inflow alters the
   lower profiles by adding sodium, radon, and oxygen; the second modifies
   the mid-depth region by adding `weathering tracers' (especially calcium
   and silicon) derived from the Ely greenstone. The oxidation of Fe2+
   diffusing upward and laterally from the sediment-water interface is
   accompanied by near-complete coprecipitation of phosphorus. The
   oxidation of Fe2+ has only a minor effect on silicic acid, probably
   because of unfavorably large Si:P and preferential association of
   Fe(III) with phosphorus. Despite low pH and temperature, detectable
   amounts of Mn2+ oxidize and precipitate above iron in the water column.
   Solute profiles differentially register the complex effects of
   hydrodynamic vs. geochemical processes, and as a consequence, affect the
   estimation of solute budgets in ice-covered lakes.}},

Title = {{EVALUATION OF THE DEPTH-INTEGRATION METHOD OF MEASURING WATER DISCHARGE
   IN LARGE RIVERS}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{201-236}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The depth-integration method of measuring water discharge makes a
   continuous measurement of the water velocity from the water surface to
   the bottom at 20 to 40 locations or verticals across a river. It is
   especially practical for large rivers where river traffic makes it
   impractical to use boats attached to taglines strung across the river or
   to use current meters suspended from bridges. This method has the
   additional advantage over the standard two- and eight-tenths method in
   that a discharge-weighted suspended-sediment sample can be collected at
   the same time. When this method is used in large rivers such as the
   Missouri, Mississippi and Ohio, a microwave navigation system is used to
   determine the ship's position at each vertical sampling location across
   the river, and to make accurate velocity corrections to compensate for
   ship drift. An essential feature is a hydraulic winch that can lower and
   raise the current meter at a constant transit velocity so that the
   velocities at all depths are measured for equal lengths of time.
   Field calibration measurements show that: (1) the mean velocity measured
   on the upcast (bottom to surface) is within 1\% of the standard mean
   velocity determined by 9-11 point measurements; (2) if the transit
   velocity is less than 25\% of the mean velocity, then average error in
   the mean velocity is 4\% or less.
   The major source of bias error is a result of mounting the current meter
   above a sounding weight and sometimes above a suspended-sediment
   sampling bottle, which prevents measurement of the velocity all the way
   to the bottom. The measured mean velocity is slightly larger than the
   true mean velocity. This bias error in the discharge is largest in
   shallow water (approximately 8\% for the Missouri River at Hermann, MO,
   where the mean depth was 4.3 m) and smallest in deeper water
   (approximately 3\% for the Mississippi River at Vicksburg, MS, where the
   mean depth was 14.5 m). The major source of random error in the
   discharge is the natural variability of river velocities, which we
   assumed to be independent and random at each vertical. The standard
   error of the estimated mean velocity, at an individual vertical sampling
   location, may be as large as 9\%, for large sand-bed alluvial rivers.
   The computed discharge, however, is a weighted mean of these random
   velocities. Consequently the standard error of computed discharge is
   divided by the square root of the number of verticals, producing typical
   values between 1 and 2\%.
   The discharges measured by the depth-integrated method agreed within +/-
   5\% of those measured simultaneously by the standard two- and
   eight-tenths, six-tenth and moving boat methods.}},

Abstract = {{On the basis of monthly sampling during the period 1987-1989, the
   geochemistry of the Congo and the Ubangi (second largest tributary of
   the Congo) rivers was studied in order (1) to understand the seasonal
   variations of the physico-chemical parameters of the waters and (2) to
   estimate the annual dissolved fluxes exported by the two rivers. The
   results presented here correspond to the first three years of
   measurements carried out for a scientific programme (Interdisciplinary
   Research Programme on Geodynamics of Peri-Atlantic Intertropical
   Environments, Operation `Large River Basins' (PIRAT-GBF) undertaken
   jointly by Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers (INSU) and
   Institut Francais de Recherche Scientifique pour le Developpement en
   Cooperation (ORSTOM)) planned to run for at least ten years.
   The Congo River is more diluted than the Ubangi (34 mg l-1 vs. 42 mg
   l-1). For both rivers, the inorganic dissolved load is composed mainly
   of HCO3- and SiO2. The chemical composition of the water does not change
   with time. In the Ubangi River, because of the presence of Precambrian
   carbonate rocks in its catchment, the proportions of HCO3- and Ca2+ are
   higher. On a seasonal scale, the concentration of dissolved cations and
   anions varies inversely with discharge, except silica. The comparison of
   the discharge-concentration relationship with a theoretical `zero
   dilution' shows that the evolution of the concentration of dissolved
   substances is a simple dilution by the surface waters, with, in the case
   of the Ubangi, a small supply of dissolved substances by the surface
   waters.
   Using three different methods of calculation, the estimated annual
   inorganic dissolved flux of the Congo ranges from 39 x 10(6) to 44 x
   10(6) tons (according to the year), with about 10\% of this coming from
   the Ubangi drainage basin.}},

Abstract = {{Alluvial ground waters used for irrigation in the southwest Lockyer
   Valley, Queensland, experience varying salinity problems. Samples were
   taken on three occasions along transects in the valleys of the Tenthill

   (February 1985), and during a period of drought (January 1987). The
   waters are categorized by chemical type, and hydrochemical sections are
   plotted for major cation data (magnesium, calcium and sodium). The
   interpretation of the sections permits the identification of recharge
   areas for the alluvial aquifers, and the location of saline intrusions
   into the alluvium from underlying sandstone aquifers. It is also
   possible, with the assistance of chemical type, to correlate some saline
   intrusions in adjacent valleys as issuing from the same sandstone
   aquifers. A diagram to summarize the locations and magnitudes of
   salinity changes along transects is given.}},

Abstract = {{Parameter estimation and contaminant source characterization are key
   steps in the development of a coupled groundwater flow and contaminant
   transport simulation model. Here a methodology for simultaneous model
   parameter estimation and source characterization is presented. The
   parameter estimation/source characterization inverse model combines
   groundwater flow and contaminant transport simulation with non-linear
   maximum likelihood estimation to determine optimal estimates of the
   unknown model parameters and source characteristics based on
   measurements of hydraulic head and contaminant concentration.
   First-order uncertainty analysis provides a means for assessing the
   reliability of the maximum likelihood estimates and evaluating the
   accuracy and reliability of the flow and transport model predictions. A
   series of hypothetical examples is presented to demonstrate the ability
   of the inverse model to solve the combined parameter estimation/source
   characterization inverse problem. Hydraulic conductivities, effective
   porosity, longitudinal and transverse dispersivities, boundary flux, and
   contaminant flux at the source are estimated for a two-dimensional
   groundwater system. In addition, characterization of the history of
   contaminant disposal or location of the contaminant source is
   demonstrated. Finally, the problem of estimating the statistical
   parameters that describe the errors associated with the head and
   concentration data is addressed. A stage-wise estimation procedure is
   used to jointly estimate these statistical parameters along with the
   unknown model parameters and source characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of a 3 year conifer harvesting programme on stream-water
   quality are described for the acidic and acid-sensitive Afon Hore
   catchment. Nitrate and potassium concentrations, initially almost
   quadrupled, have remained high for 4 years from the commencement of the
   harvesting programme. For the undisturbed (control) system, the
   fluctuations are small and peak during the winter months. With
   harvesting, a phase change takes place and peak concentrations occur
   during the autumn period. A similar pattern, but with no phase shift, is
   observed for dissolved organic matter, although concentrations increase
   less: peak concentrations occur during the summer to autumn periods.
   During the first 2 years of felling, aluminium concentrations increase
   in the winter period: after that, concentration differences are much
   smaller. During the summer base-flow period, alkalinity and calcium
   values decrease. Sodium and chloride concentrations increase with time
   owing to a corresponding increase in the rainfall input. This trend is
   not observed for the stream in the felled catchment. For sulphate, there
   is a general decline in concentration for both the control and felled
   areas. With felling, a seasonal pattern has been introduced: the lowest
   concentrations occur in winter.
   The results are interpreted in terms of: (1) reduced atmospheric
   scavenging of sea salt and sulphur due to the loss of the trees; (2)
   increased losses of the nutrients from the soils due to reduced uptake
   by the vegetation; (3) increased aluminium releases from the soil's
   cation exchange store following increased total inorganic anion
   concentrations resulting from nitrate generation from (2); (4) a reduced
   contribution of ground water to the stream or an increased acidification
   of the ground water.
   The results are discussed in relation to environmental and water
   management issues. Nitrate production will probably not be of importance
   to either, owing to the low levels found in the stream. The increase in
   aluminium may extend the length of the stream where less favourable
   biological conditions prevail. There are potential water treatment
   problems for sensitive catchments due to manganese, dissolved organic
   carbon (colour), bromide and iodide generation during deforestation.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrodynamics of the groundwater system of the upland
   granito-gneissic plateau of Madagascar is governed by the structure of
   the underlying aquifer. In the alteritic interfluves, the aquifer has
   two layers; the peat aquifer is multilayered.
   Groundwater levels and spring discharges observed over 3 successive
   years distinguish between two different types of hydraulic behaviour.
   (1) Under the interfluves, unconfined conditions are found in
   allochtonous weathered material, and semi-confined conditions in the
   autochtonous weathered basement. These two systems are separated by a
   semi-permeable clay layer. The first system responds rapidly to rainfall
   (approximately 15 days) whereas the second system responds more slowly
   (approximately 3 months). This leads to a vertical flux between the two
   aquifers, the direction of which depends on the season; at the beginning
   of the wet season the flux is downwards, but during the later part of
   the season the direction reverses. (2) In the low-lying regions, where
   sequences are superimposed, the direction of the vertical flow changes
   several times over a year. At the beginning of the wet season the flux
   is downwards, it reverses at the end of the season. A downwards flux is
   then observed towards the second part of the dry season. Such behaviour
   is only observed in the lowest third of the catchment where permeable
   silts take the place of less permeable peat.
   This pattern of fluxes suggests a close relationship between surface
   water and groundwater regimes, and has a major influence on the
   individual water balances of the two systems.}},

Abstract = {{This work is concerned with investigating the existence of a systematic
   relationship between the residuals of a simple linear rainfall-runoff
   model and the observed discharge as evidence of non-linearity. A
   modification to the simple linear model is proposed, based on the
   evidence of non-linearity obtained when the model is applied to five
   catchments. The results of applying the modified model are found to be
   satisfactory. A simple calibration procedure for the modified model is
   suggested. The suitability of the proportion of variance accounted for
   in the verification period, as a model evaluation criterion, is
   discussed and it is concluded that the criterion is unsuitable for use
   within the verification periods. Even for a consistent model, the values
   of R2 can vary greatly if the calibration period is unusually wet and

Abstract = {{The Xinanjiang model is a rainfall-runoff, distributed, basin model for
   use in humid and semi-humid regions. The evapotranspiration component is
   represented by a model of three soil layers. Runoff production occurs on
   repletion of storage to capacity values which are assumed to be
   distributed throughout the basin. Prior to 1980, runoff was separated
   into surface and groundwater components using Horton's concept of
   infiltration. Subsequently, the concept of hillslope hydrology was
   introduced with an additional component, interflow, being identified.
   Runoff concentration to the outflow of each sub-basin is represented by
   a unit hydrograph or by a lag and route technique. The damping or
   routing effects of the channel system connecting the sub-basins are
   represented by Muskingum routing. There are fifteen parameters in all,
   of which the model is particularly sensitive to six. Optimization of the
   parameters is achieved with different objective functions according to
   the nature of each parameter. The model has been widely used in China
   since 1980, mainly for flood forecasting, though more recently it is
   also being used for other purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Total evaporation (E) was measured on lupin crops of differing leaf area
   per unit ground area in southwestern Australia. Leaf area was controlled
   by sowing at different times and rates. The objective was to explore the
   feasibility of increasing water use in order to reduce recharge to
   rising, shallow, saline water tables.
   Replicated plots of Lupinus angustifolius were sown at 100 and 200 kg
   ha-1 on 24 May and at 100 kg ha-1 on 7 June, 1988. E was measured by
   ventilated chambers from each of these treatments over eight 24 h
   periods grouped at the beginning, middle and end of a 28 day period.
   Mean rates of E were 2.16 mm day-1 for the later sown lupins at 100 kg
   ha-1, 2.49 mm day-1 for the earlier sown lupins at 100 kg ha-1 and 2.90
   mm day-1 for the earlier sown lupins at 200 kg ha-1. The corresponding
   relative values for E were 1.00, 1.15 and 1.34. The transpiration
   component of E was estimated by measuring sap flow with a heat balance
   technique on individual plants within the chambers. Daily values of
   transpiration varied from 0.8 to 2 mm giving residual soil evaporation
   values of 1.0-1.6 mm day-1. E from soil was a significant cause of water
   loss particularly in the plots with low leaf area. At preflowering and
   early flowering E increased linearly with increasing leaf area per unit
   ground area up to values of 2.6. Soil evaporation decreased linearly
   with increasing leaf area.
   We conclude that increased seeding rates and earlier sowing of lupins
   have the potential to increase E and to reduce recharge and the rise of
   saline water tables.}},

Abstract = {{SHIFT (Sistema HIdrologico de Facetas Triangulares) is a computational
   system that allows for the: (1) creation, editing and visualization of a
   watershed Digital Elevation Model (DEM), based on the Triangular
   Irregular Network (TIN) concepts; (2) input and interpolation of soil,
   river-bed, and rainfall data; and (3) calculation and routing of runoff
   in all the facets and reaches. The TIN DEM model is constructed from a
   set of points, where the slope changes abruptly. Afterwards, the
   drainage network is automatically identified and an interactive editor
   allows the addition or deletion of points to eliminate network
   discontinuities. Rainfall data are interpolated by means of a procedure
   based on the minimization of the bending energy of a thin plate. In
   order to calculate and route the runoff, the system determines the
   routing sequence of river segments and for each one: identifies the
   facets forming the contributing area; and determines a cascade of
   overland flow planes. Then, for each element and time interval, the
   system calculates the infiltration and routes the resultant runoff by a
   numerical solution of the kinematic wave equations. This information is
   saved and the user can see the hydrograph for any facet or reach.}},

Abstract = {{A paired catchment experiment was conducted in Mendolong, Sabah,
   Malaysia to monitor water-yield changes due to different methods of
   clear-felling tropical rainforest and establishment of tree plantation
   with fast-growing trees (Acacia mangium). The study included five
   catchments; treatments before planting were: (1) cutting and burning of
   secondary vegetation (forest fire 1982/1983), (2) clear-felling, manual
   log extraction and no burning, (3) clear-felling, tractor log extraction
   and burning. Two catchments were monitored as controls; one for the
   secondary vegetation and one for the rain forest. A calibration
   monitoring period for all catchments for 27.5 months started in August
   1985. The results presented here include this calibration period and
   32.5 months during and after treatments. Multiple regression analyses on
   runoff from treated and reference catchments before and after treatment
   were used to determine the increase in runoff due to treatments.
   Mean yearly areal rainfall was 3352 mm and mean yearly runoff 1956 mm
   for the control catchments for the 5 years of study. Calculated
   water-yield increases were for (1) 1008, (2) 447 and (3) 1190 mm for the
   first 32.5 months during treatment and plantation establishment.
   The fastest runoff generation during storms was found after cutting,
   burning and no soil disturbance, leaving no vegetation to transpire and
   minimum disturbance to natural waterways. The use of tractors, causing
   soil disturbance, severe loss of infiltrability and top soil hydraulic
   conductivity resulted in decreased mean stormflow discharge during and
   after treatment. Later, with maintained low infiltrability and prolonged
   erosion clearing new waterways instead of the disturbed ones, a faster
   runoff generation and larger runoff increase were found in the last year
   of study.}},

Abstract = {{The constraints on the different fitting parameters used in the water
   retention equation, h(theta), and hydraulic conductivity, K(theta), are
   analyzed using the infiltration equation as a testing tool. The
   following characteristic equations are considered: those of Gardner;
   Brooks and Corey; Brutsaert; Van Genuchten subject to both Mualem's and
   Burdine's condition; Van Genuchten combined with Brooks and Corey; and
   Fujita. It is shown that most combinations of h(theta) and K(theta) or
   K(h) break down, when tested over the large range of soil types
   encountered in field situations. For clay soils, especially, the
   best-fit parameter values often become inconsistent with the
   infiltration theory. The best combination is the Van Genuchten equation
   for h(theta) with the Burdine condition m = 1 - 2/n and the Brooks and
   Corey equation for K(theta). This combination satisfies the infiltration
   condition for all soil types, even when applied to the two extreme cases
   used by Green and Ampt and Talsma and Parlange. The interdependence of
   h(theta) and K(theta) parameters is discussed.}},

   PARAMETERIZATION - AN EXAMPLE FROM DRAINAGE BASINS DISTURBED BY SURFACE

Abstract = {{The sophistication and use of distributed hydrologic models are
   increasing at the expense of data collection and field experimentation
   upon which such models were conceptualized and parameterized. The
   purpose of this study is to explore the use of field data, collected
   from reclaimed surface mines, in the parameterization of ANSWERS, a
   distributed hydrologic model. A sensitivity analysis of ANSWERS was
   conducted at two scales, the plot scale (< 1 m2), typically the scale at
   which field data are collected, and the drainage basin scale (0.1-0.3
   km2), the size of reclaimed surface mine basins. The results of this
   analysis indicate that at both plot and basin scale, the most sensitive
   parameter of the ANSWERS hydrologic model with respect to the volume and
   peak rate of hillslope runoff and basin discharge is steady-state
   infiltration capacity (FC), a variable that can be measured directly
   from a dripping-rainfall infiltrometer test. At the plot scale, the time
   to FC (T(fc)) is most sensitive to two parameters that control the rate
   of decay of the infiltration curve, namely, surface roughness (RN) and a
   dimensionless coefficient (P) relating infiltration capacity to soil
   moisture. By measuring FC from infiltrometer tests and adjusting RN and
   P by visually fitting simulated infiltration curves to field
   infiltrometer-derived infiltration curves, the ANSWERS model can be
   parameterized, in part, at the plot scale for hydrologic simulation at
   the basin scale. At the basin scale, the time to peak discharge (T(p))
   of the simulated hydrograph is dependent primarily on accurate
   representation of the drainage network, a function of the element size
   selected to characterize the distribution of model parameters in the
   basin. Model performance was evaluated in two reclaimed surface mine
   basins, one dominated by infiltration-excess overland flow and the other
   by saturation overland flow.
   ANSWERS is most appropriately suited for drainage basins dominated by
   infiltration-excess overland flow because it is physically based with
   respect to infiltration, overland flow, and channelized flow processes.
   In these basins a field program of infiltrometer tests, designed to
   include representative basin surfaces with respect to soil and surface
   properties, is sufficient for model parameterization in order to
   supplement existing hydrologic data or to evaluate the probable
   hydrologic consequence of a land-use change. In drainage basins
   dominated by saturation overland flow, subsurface flow contribution to
   simulated hydrographs, described by the lumped parameter GRF, must
   presently be calibrated against observed storm hydrographs. Model
   parameterization is accomplished by augmenting the infiltration-excess
   component of the simulated hydrograph, determined by the above
   parameterization technique, with a specified proportion (GRF) of the
   infiltrated water. The lumped parameter GRF is problematic in the sense
   that it is sensitive to infiltration capacity as well as storm size and
   intensity and, therefore, must be calibrated for characteristic storm
   events. However, the ANSWERS model is recommended for further evaluation
   and use in surface mine environments, which are initially dominated by
   infiltration-excess overland flow due to low infiltration capacities of
   newly reclaimed mine soils.}},

Abstract = {{River, ground water, and snow samples were collected in the Truckee
   river drainage basin in northern California and Nevada to determine the
   mechanisms of bank storage. Lake Tahoe, the source for the Truckee
   river, has a delta-D of - 57 and delta-O-18 of - 5.5. These compositions
   are more enriched than the average local precipitation, calculated to be
   - 117 in delta-D and - 15.8 in delta-O-18, due to continued evaporation
   during the long residence time of the water in the lake. Thus, Lake
   Tahoe water can be easily recognized allowing for easy tracing as bank
   storage.
   An enrichment threshold value was developed to explain the stable
   isotopic ratios observed in the Truckee river. The delta-D value of - 85
   was determined as being the threshold value, below which evaporation can
   explain the isotopic composition observed in the Truckee river, and
   above which the presence of Lake Tahoe water is required. There does not
   appear to be a direct relationship between the delta-D value of the
   Truckee river and the discharge to the river from Lake Tahoe, at least
   in the upper reaches of the basin. The rise in delta-D of the river to a
   value similar to that of the lake appears to move progressively upstream
   and is thought to be related to the discharge of the bank-stored Lake
   Tahoe water.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater systems were studied in the 4200 ha East Belka catchment in
   a dryland farming area 300 km east of Perth, W.A., to determine the
   cause of sandplain seeps. Detailed investigations were carried out on a
   200 ha hillslope to determine the characteristics of a shallow aquifer
   system responsible for the salinization of previously productive
   agricultural soils. The impact of the shallow aquifer on the regional
   system was investigated.
   A shallow (less than 8 m), perched, perennial aquifer was encountered in
   the deep sandplain materials. Groundwater discharge of about 1000 kl
   year-1 from the perched aquifer maintained saline soils across a 5 ha
   sandplain seep. Perching is due to the decreased permeability, geometry
   and silicification of the top of the mottled and pallid zones, and the
   convergence of perched ground waters near the seep. Slug test
   measurements suggest that the sandplain soils have a relatively low
   hydraulic conductivity (0.15 m day-1). Water qualities in the perched
   aquifer ranged from brackish to saline (3000-8000 mg l-1 TDS), peaking
   in the salt-affected area (12 000 mg l-1 TDS). High nitrate and Cl/Br
   ratios occur in the shallow aquifer and in the regional ground water
   beneath the sandplain seep.
   Recharge to the deep aquifer takes place throughout the catchment, but
   is greatest beneath the sandplain seep, where a perennial groundwater
   mound occurs. Recharge to the regional aquifer was estimated to be 6 to
   15 mm year-1, increasing to between 20 and 60 mm year-1 beneath the
   seep. By contrast, less than 0.3 mm year-1 is able to leave the
   catchment as regional groundwater flow. Water-levels in the deep bores
   are consequently rising by 0.05 to 0.25 m year-1. Recharge to the deep
   aquifer beneath the seep, and low groundwater gradients, create the
   potential for groundwater flow to take place beneath the topographic
   divide and towards the adjoining catchment. However, as the vertical
   flux to the aquifer is two orders of magnitude greater than the
   horizontal flow, ground waters are effectively impounded within the
   catchment.}},

Abstract = {{On Grand Cayman, freshwater bodies present in the Bluff Formation are
   typically small and occur as thin lenses floating on top of dense saline
   water. Evaluation of the water resource potential of these freshwater
   lenses is difficult because of their variable hydrological conditions,
   complex paleohydrogeology and aquifer heterogeneity.
   Secondary porosity created by preferential dissolution of aragonitic
   fossil components is common. Open fissures and joints developed under
   tectonic stress and karst development associated with sea-level
   fluctuations are, however, the two most important causes of porosity and
   permeability in the aquifers on Grand Cayman. Fracture and karst
   porosity control the lens occurrence by: (1) acting as avenues for the
   intrusion of seawater or upward migration of saline water; (2) acting as
   recharge focal points; (3) enhancing hydrodynamic dispersion; (4)
   defining lens geometry; (5) facilitating carbonate dissolution along
   joints and fissures.
   A clear understanding of the hydrological and geological conditions is
   important in developing small lenses in a setting similar to that on
   Grand Cayman. This pragmatic approach can help identify the optimum
   location of the well field and avoid areas particularly susceptible to
   saline water intrusion.}},

Abstract = {{The relations between groundwater composition, land use, soil conditions
   and flow patterns on a regional scale are studied for the Gooi and
   Vechtstreek area in the Netherlands. This densely populated area
   consists of a glacier-created ridge with dry sand soils bordered by the
   Vecht and Eem River plains with wet Peat and clay soils. R-mode factor
   analysis and Q-mode cluster analysis were applied to a set of 1349
   groundwater analyses to determine the factors controlling groundwater
   composition and the main resulting water types.
   The results indicate that groundwater composition in the study area is
   affected on a regional scale by human activities through changes in land
   use and intervention in natural flow patterns. On the ridge, ground
   water is recharged by precipitation, which dissolves carbonates from the
   matrix of the sandy aquifer. Increased solute concentrations in shallow
   ground water, especially of nitrate, sulphate and potassium, indicate
   increased pollution resulting from urbanization and increasingly
   intensive agricultural activity over the past decades.
   In the Vecht River plain infiltration occurs as a result of drainage of
   polders and groundwater ``traction on the ridge. Recharge occurs by
   precipitation and from polluted surface water to which ammonium, organic
   complexes and carbonic acid are added through decomposition of organic
   matter in the peat and clay soils. The carbonic acid results in enhanced
   dissolution of carbonates present in the soil and the underlying sandy
   aquifer. Oxygen depletion and subsequent low redox potentials result in
   denitrification, dissolution of manganese and iron oxides, and sulphate
   reduction. The flow of ground water from high-level to low-level polders
   causes displacement of a former stagnant brackish groundwater body under
   the Vecht River plain accompanied by increased mixing of fresh and
   brackish ground water.}},

Abstract = {{A set of new monthly rainfall runoff models (water balance models) is
   defined, for use in river catchments smaller than about 4000 km2,
   without appreciable frost or natural or artificial lakes. The input
   series are areal precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. The
   output is riverflow. The number of parameters, used in the description
   of the hydrological phenomena in the catchment, is in most cases three,
   sometimes four. The statistical methodology used for calibrating the
   models of given catchments is described; it reduces essentially to
   regression analysis, including residual analysis, sensitivity to
   calibration period and extrapolation test. In particular, automatic
   calibration is used, excluding subjective elements. The models are
   applied to 79 river basins in Belgium, China and Burma. The results are
   compared with four similar models taken from the literature. The results
   of applying the new models are satisfactory from a statistical point of
   view and are much better than those quoted in the literature; a greater
   part of the observed runoff is explained and there is no residual
   seasonality. This results from the different mathematical' structure of
   the models, and especially from the use, in the published models, of
   several storages with maximum `capacities', with no distinction between
   slow and fast runoff corresponding to baseflow and direct runoff,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of the nature and significance of the influence of dambos upon
   river flows in Zimbabwe is undertaken on a database of up to 110 gauged
   catchments containing different dambo densities, ranging from 1 to 63\%,
   and other catchment characteristics. It is concluded that dambos are
   indiscriminatory factors in determining the volume, persistence and
   variability of annual runoff. Dambos do not maintain dry-season low
   flows, as is widely believed, and reduce low flows where they occur in
   association with regolith with significant base flow components. The
   impact of dambos on flood magnitude, variability and frequency is
   insignificant, with the possible exception of extreme events.}},

   on river flow regimes from 25 reports in seven different countries
   illustrate an absence of consensus on the influence of dambos on flood
   flows, low flows and total catchment runoff. A case has been established
   for dambos to be considered to reduce low flows in certain regions of

   regional evaporation data from Zimbabwe, and by reassessing past studies
   of dambo hydrology in Malawi and Zambia.}},

Abstract = {{In unripe marine clay soils, water flow occurs in relation to shrinkage
   and swelling of the soil material. In the initial stage of physical
   ripening, when the soil retains its higher moisture ratio, dewatering is
   mainly accompanied by normal and unidimensional shrinkage. Soil-water
   flow at this stage, in the absence of significant matric potential
   differences, can be explained only by overburden potential. In a
   one-dimensional vertical system, numerical solutions of non-steady flow
   during normal shrinkage have been validated with experimental data. For
   the condition of a closed boundary at the top and a constant pressure
   head at the bottom, there are significant differences in downward flux
   density with and without an overburden component to total potential.
   Further, for the condition of a closed bottom boundary, the generation
   of an upward flux can only be attributed to the overburden potential.
   This implies that the overburden potential plays an important role in
   the Darcy flow, especially for the unripe marine clay soil.}},

Abstract = {{The migration of arsenic and cadmium species in ground water was
   investigated with the aid of tracer experiments at a test site in a
   fluvioglacial aquifer. Experimental breakthrough curves, obtained under
   natural flow conditions, characterize the migration of arsenic and
   cadmium species in the ground water in relation to a conservative
   tracer. Transport velocities of arsenic species corresponded to those of
   the groundwater flow and resulted in a rapid breakthrough in the
   observation wells. The recovery of the arsenic species, calculated with
   respect to the conservative tracer, averaged about 50\%. Intensity of
   sorption increased with decreasing concentrations of arsenic species.
   The migration of cadmium species, however, was controlled by chemical
   precipitation of otavite and a slow redissolution of this compound. The
   breakthrough of cadmium in the observation wells, thus, was much slower
   with respect to the water movement. A recovery of about 40\% was
   observed after more than 1 year of observation. Increased concentrations
   of chloride or/and sulphate resulted in remobilization of cadmium.
   Breakthrough curves are described by a commonly used dispersion model.
   It appears that a retardation factor is not sufficient to describe the
   asymmetrical breakthrough curves; it must be supplemented by recovery
   rates and a specific dispersivity, defined by the time variance of
   concentration at a given point. Longer flow distances or lower initial
   concentrations caused reduced recoveries, higher specific dispersivities
   and retardations both for arsenic and for cadmium species.}},

   computation, graphs for the special functions involved in the proposed

Abstract = {{In a study of multilinear modelling of flood wave propagation based on a
   time distribution scheme, an attempt is made to overcome certain
   limitations of the currently available multilinear models. The
   physically based Muskingum method is used as the linear sub-model.
   Unlike the currently available multilinear models, wherein the
   parameters are held constant for routing prescribed flow zones of the
   inflow hydrograph, in the proposed method they vary at each routing time
   step. This allows better modelling of the non-linear behaviour of the
   flood wave movement and eliminates the subjectivity of deciding on the
   number of flow zones to be used for routing the given inflow hydrograph.
   The suitability of this method for routing floods in wide uniform
   rectangular channels without lateral flow is studied using hypothetical
   data. The study reveals that the proposed method is capable of
   describing flood wave movement in open channels, as a result of a flood
   hydrograph characterized by narrow loop rating curve.}},

Abstract = {{Land and stream salinisation in Western Australia has occurred as a
   result of the clearing of native vegetation for agricultural
   development. One approach to controlling the salinisation, extensive
   reforestation, has been tested on a site which was 35\% cleared and
   converted to pasture in the 1950s. By 1979 saline ground water was
   discharging in the valley where the clearing had taken place. At that
   time 63 Eucalyptus and two Pinus species were planted in 0.5 ha blocks
   across the site, covering some 70\% of the cleared land.
   The reforestation has been successful in substantially lowering the
   saline groundwater table across the site. Over the 1980-1989 period, the
   average minimum groundwater levels beneath reforestation declined by 5.5
   m relative to the ground level and by 7.3 m relative to a nearby pasture
   control site. After the first 3 years the rate of decline was
   near-uniform with time. The average salinity of the ground water beneath
   reforestation decreased by 11\%.}},

Abstract = {{Snowmelt recharge to shallow groundwater systems is the primary source
   of streamflow in many mountainous watersheds, but characteristics of
   these systems are not well understood, and their contribution to
   streamflow is often not appreciated. Data from a detailed study on the
   Upper Sheep Creek Watershed located within the Reynolds Creek
   Experimental Watershed in southwestern Idaho were analyzed to
   characterize the interactions between snowmelt, groundwater and
   streamflow. Response time between snowmelt, groundwater levels and
   streamflow was drastically different from year to year depending on the
   extent of the snowpack. Response time to snowmelt for piezometers and
   weirs located 135 m downslope from an isolated drift was 3-5 days during
   an average snow year and up to 70 days for a year with snow accumulation
   that was 40\% of normal. The primary aquifer is believed to be
   unconfined during low snowmelt years and confined when normal or
   above-normal snowmelt causes high groundwater levels. Snowmelt from an
   isolated drift enters the primary aquifer upslope of the confining
   layer. Rapid response during years with normal snow accumulation is
   therefore primarily a pressure pulse through the confined aquifer.
   Recharge during years of low snow accumulation is insufficient to fill
   the primary aquifer to the confining layer, and response time is
   indicative of travel time through the aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of climatic change on hydrogeology is investigated by
   studying the evolution of the North Lincolnshire Chalk aquifer system
   during the last 140000 years. A numerical modelling approach is adopted
   using a density coupled, finite difference model to reconstruct past
   groundwater environments. Two major controls on groundwater circulation
   are considered: the position of sea-level, which determines the base
   level condition, and the amount of recharge associated with different
   climates. The Quaternary history of the region is used to define aquifer
   boundary conditions, and climate analogue data are used to determine
   likely recharge amounts. Model results cannot be compared against
   groundwater flow volumes or head, other than for the present-day
   situation, and so hydrochemical evidence is used to constrain the model
   simulations. The main finding is that recharge to the Chalk aquifer
   during the last 140 000 years has been restricted to periods when the
   climate and sea-level position have been similar to those of the present
   day. The Devensian cold period experienced very minor recharge, with no
   Chalk permeability development. Forest clearance since about 5000 years
   ago is predicted to have permitted an increase in the volume of
   freshwater recharge, which increased the rate of Chalk permeability
   development. The presence of saline water at depth in the aquifer is
   argued, on the basis of the model behaviour, to be contributed by a
   component of upward cross-formational flow.}},

Abstract = {{Stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen together with tritium were used
   to investigate infiltration and unsaturated zone flow at Carlsbad
   Cavern. Water samples were collected from drips and pools every 4 months
   for a year. Seepage flow dominates infiltration at the cavern,
   homogenizing the isotopic composition of individual and seasonal
   precipitation events early along the vertical flowpath. Within the
   relatively narrow range in the stable isotopic ratios of cave drip water
   (delta-D of -53 to -44 parts per thousand, delta-O-18 of -8.3 to -6.6
   parts per thousand), isotopic changes on two different time-scales were
   identified. A longer-term variation, probably driven by changes in the
   relative amount of heavy-isotope-enriched summer precipitation, is
   evident in the slight enrichment of drips collected at shallower depths
   in the cavern (above 1100 m elevation). This suggests vertical travel
   times to the main cave rooms of the order of decades, consistent with
   observed tritium activities (from less than 4.6 to 16.9 tritium units
   (T.U.)). Given these residence times and the narrow range in isotopic
   composition, a seasonal trend in the isotopic composition of cave water
   (coincident at all levels in the cavern) is probably related to seasonal
   changes in the cave climate. Active air circulation driven by
   differences in air temperature between the cave and outside during the
   winter increases the evaporation rate from cave pools and causes
   enrichment in heavy isotopes. This signal may be transmitted to
   infiltrating water via isotope exchange before the water drips into the
   cave, consistent with the temporary storage of drip water in limited
   zones of saturation around the cave rooms. These zones may develop in
   response to capillary-driven surface tension before infiltrating water
   drips into the unsaturated-flow barriers represented by the large,
   air-filled cave passages.}},

Abstract = {{A multiple input-single output linear functional model for river flow
   routing is developed. The linear kernels, corresponding to each input
   series, are approximated by expansions in Meixner functions,
   unit-weighted orthonormal polynomials and Chebyshev polynomials. The
   memory length of the system and the order of polynomial expansion of the
   linear kernels are determined by trial and error. The cross-correlation
   between each input and the output provided a short-cut method of memory
   length determination.
   A two input-single output linear functional model was applied to predict
   daily flow of the Aliakmon river in Greece, using daily flows at points
   further up the main stream and on a tributary. The results were
   satisfactory. The predictions of daily output for real-time forecasting
   were further improved by fitting autoregressive moving average models to
   the residual sequences.}},

   obtained. Computational results in unsteady state indicated that the
   vertical downward speed of the wetting front is generally much larger
   than that of a tracer, which is assumed to be injected together with the
   rain water at the soil surface. Theoretical considerations were then
   developed to relate the movement of the wetting front and that of the
   tracer front to water movement in soil. Finally, numerical analyses were
   performed for various precipitation intensities, under various initial
   soil moisture conditions and with various soil properties. The speed of
   the wetting front approaches that of the tracer as the precipitation
   intensity increases, as the initial soil moisture decreases, and the
   grain size increases.}},

Abstract = {{Pronounced and short-term changes in freshwater chemistry ('acidic
   episodes') can have a significant biological impact. More attention has
   been paid to chronic acidification, and there has been no previous
   attempt to produce a regional summary of occurrence of episodes in
   Europe, to describe their chemical characteristics, or to synthesise
   what is known of their controlling processes. These are the objectives
   of this review.
   The basic characteristics of episodes are explained, along with the
   problems of establishing an adequate description. Because of the
   relative paucity of other information on water composition, the review
   is based largely on measurements of short-term pH depressions, although
   other data are considered where available. Most of the studies reported
   here were conducted in Norway, Sweden, Scotland and Wales. The differing
   physical characteristics of the various study catchments are assessed;
   these influence the hydrochemical responses to hydrological events
   (snowmelt or rainfall). Antecedent conditions are also important.
   Nevertheless, it is possible to arrive at some generalising conclusions
   about episodes. Snowmelt appears to instigate the most pronounced
   episodes, particularly in lakes. However, rainfall-induced episodes are
   generally much more frequent. Direct links between the chemistry of the
   snowmelt or rainfall which induced the episode and surface water
   chemistry are relatively rare, except in the case of a large input of
   sea-salt. Sulphate is the strong acid anion most strongly related to pH
   depression during episodes, although nitrate is important in some
   locations at snowmelt. Organic acids can play an important role in some
   peaty catchments. Dilution of base cations during episodes was also
   observed in most of the studies reviewed. Some depression of pH in
   surface waters seems ubiquitous during hydrological events, but in areas
   which have experienced large depositions of pollution, long-term
   acidification has conditioned catchments for the episodic release of
   acid. Changing flowpaths through hydrological events are of overwhelming
   importance in controlling the chemical character of episodes.}},

Abstract = {{Potential evaporation from a wet bare soil field was measured with a
   large sensitive weighing lysimeter on a 20 min time step for 5 days at
   Davis, California. The diurnal evaporation rate modeled with the
   Penman-Brutsaert model for potential evaporation with atmospheric
   stability corrections resulted in the best description of the measured
   fluxes. The Priestley-Taylor model was accurate for short intervals
   except when conditions of minimal advection were exceeded during the
   day. It was noted that the Priestley-Taylor formulation with alpha =
   1.26 performs best under unstable atmospheric conditions. During stable
   conditions, the value of alpha = 1.26 underpredicts the measured
   potential evaporation. The advection-aridity model for actual
   evaporation based on the Bouchet complementary relationship was studied.
   Strong advection explains the tendency found in other experimental
   studies to underpredict daily potential evaporation. A methodology to
   account for the excess advection is discussed in the complementary
   model, and the flux predictions were equivalent to the Penman-Brutsaert
   formulation for wet surfaces.}},

   theory of heat and momentum transport can be used to predict the latent

   Experiments were carried out on the Campbell Tract at the University of
   California, Davis, from 14 September to 23 November 1990. The latent
   heat flux was measured precisely with a large weighing lysimeter and the
   surface temperature by a thermal IR transducer. The evaporation
   predictions and lysimeter measurements overall were in good agreement
   (R2 = 0.86), including cases of dry surface conditions. Even low daily
   evaporation of the order of 1 mm could be modeled with the procedure
   studied.}},

Abstract = {{The Cl- content of ground water in the central and northern Negev ranges
   between 250 mg l-1 in the Beer Sheva area and 1600 mg l-1 near the
   Egyptian border, where the water is also thermal with high
   concentrations of sulphates and iron. During the last few years,
   groundwater resources in the heavily populated Beer Sheva area have
   become endangered by a continuing process of salinization.
   In the course of the present work, it was found that, in the study area,
   ground water flows through a multiple aquifer system including the
   Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous Kurnub Group and the Upper Cretaceous Judea
   Group aquifers. Because of the absence of impermeable beds at the
   boundary between the two groups, brackish ground water flows from the
   Kurnub Group into the overlying Judea Group aquifer. Moreover, numerous
   faults discovered in the subsurface facilitate lateral inflow of Kurnub
   ground water into the Judea aquifer.
   By interpreting new lithostratigraphic data from the Kurnub Group and
   seismic surveys made in the study area, it is shown that the Kurnub
   aquifer extends far beyond the hitherto known boundaries and contains an
   additional estimated volume of 51 x 10(9) m3 of paleowater. The limiting
   factors of its exploitability are groundwater depth and salinity. The
   rational exploitation of the Kurnub paleowater may prevent salinization
   of the overlying Judea Group aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{A computer method is presented to estimate the drawdown and the flow
   rate development in wells with multiple or long screens. The
   mathematical model involves the following processes: unsteady,
   quasi-three-dimensional laminar flow in a multiple leaky aquifer system,
   laminar and/or turbulent radial flow in the skin zone including the
   screens, turbulent axial flow and change of the kinetic energy in the
   screen pipe, and the effect of well storage. The numerical accuracy was
   checked against analytical (Theis, Wikramaratna) and semianalytical
   (numerical Laplace-inversion) solutions. The low error of numerical
   drawdown and flow rate simulation, achieved during testing, is
   acceptable in most of the practical cases. Two case studies demonstrate
   the calibration of aquifer and screen parameters. The method may also be
   used as an approximate tool to analyse the three-dimensional flow around
   wells with long, partially penetrating screens in thick, vertically
   heterogeneous aquifers. Analysis of the approximation error and some
   results of practical application are given.}},

Abstract = {{First-order reliability analysis involving Taylor series linearization
   at central values of the uncertain variables is well known as a means of
   approximating the output reliability for hydrologic and environmental
   models. However, linearization at central values has several key flaws -
   namely, problems with non-linear systems and estimation of extreme
   probabilities - which limit its usefulness. An improved first-order
   reliability approach is presented wherein the linearization point varies
   to match the output level whose exceedance probability is sought. Thus,
   the improved approach circumvents some of the problems of central value
   linearization while retaining much of its simplicity. The accuracy,
   relative to Monte Carlo simulation, of the improved approach and its use
   are demonstrated for an example of estimating the probability
   distribution of peak discharge predicted by two conceptual
   rainfall-runoff models with uncertain parameters.}},

Abstract = {{A chloride mass-balance approach to estimating soilwater ages and
   paleorecharge rates was tested in an area where considerable
   paleoclimatic data were available for comparison. Application of the
   method to data from four cores of the unsaturated zone taken in the
   western Murray Basin showed that the soil water at the base of the
   chloride build-up or bulge associated with the root zone of the native
   mallee vegetation was emplaced during the last glacial interval (at
   least 20 000 years BP). Furthermore, recharge rates at this time were
   very low. These observations agree with independent paleoclimate
   evidence that suggest that this time was colder, windier and drier.
   Results are consistent with the notion that the root-zone chloride
   bulge, so typical of the Murray Mallee region, developed in response to
   aridity that peaked during the last full glacial interval in Australia.
   The chloride method is a useful tool in paleohydrology, especially when
   used in concert with other evidence.}},

Abstract = {{A study of rainfall partitioning into throughfall, stem flow and
   interception loss was conducted during five annual cycles in a patch of
   semideciduous forest within the Trachypogon savanna in the Orinoco
   Llanos. Annual seasonal rainfall (April-November) was 1238 mm, 1228 mm,
   1531 mm, 1345 mm and 1398 mm for 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1985,
   respectively. During the years analyzed (1981-1984), the throughfall
   measured using a roving gauge technique was 75.7\% (+/- 1.2\%), 81.8\%
   (+/- 1.2\%), 74.1\% (+/- 1.1 \%) and 77.4\% (+/- 0.2\%), respectively,
   of the gross precipitation. The rain required to initiate average
   throughfall in the grove ranged from 0.6 to 1.0 mm. Of the rainfall
   reaching the grove canopy, 1.0\% (+/- 0.2\%), 1.1\% (+/- 0.2\%) and
   0.4\% (+/- 0.00\%) flowed down the trunks as stem flow in 1983, 1984 and
   1985, respectively. Consequently, interception loss accounted for 19\%
   and 12\% of gross rainfall for 1983 and 1984, respectively. Regression
   analysis indicated that throughfall, stem flow and interception loss as
   a function of gross rainfall followed similar linear patterns. Volume of
   stem flow was related to tree diameter but it decreased at the highest

Abstract = {{A model was developed to predict the potential contamination of overland
   flow by chemicals removed from soil water by rainfall on sloping soil.
   The model accounts for transient water infiltration, overland flow and
   convective-dispersive solute transport in the soil. Solutes are assumed
   to be subjected to linear equilibrium sorption onto the soil's solid
   phase. Numerical simulations indicated that the value of the coefficient
   for soil chemical transfer to surface runoff does not affect the soil
   surface concentration when soil is initially dry, but is linearly
   related to the dissolved chemical flux to overland flow. This enables an
   approximate solution to the convective-dispersive equation for
   determining soil surface concentration, independent of its determination
   from rainfall-runoff relationships. Simulated dissolved chemical
   concentrations at the soil surface and in surface runoff were determined
   for different antecedent soil moistures and rainfall intensities. These
   concentrations were found to be lower when antecedent moisture was low,
   because ponding time for drier soils is longer and during this period
   soil solutes are therefore displaced downward by greater volumes of
   infiltrating water. For a specified initial soilwater content, higher
   rainfall rates cause higher dissolved chemical concentrations at the
   soil surface and in runoff water. The hydrological parameters (e.g.
   soil-surface slope, length and roughness) affecting the residence time
   of surface water on the field, greatly affect runoff concentration for a
   short time after the initiation of overland flow. The runoff
   concentration for longer periods is mainly affected by soil surface
   concentration, which is in turn controlled by the dispersion of the
   chemicals in the soil. The distribution coefficient between the liquid
   and solid phases of the soil controls the release of adsorbed chemicals
   to the soil solution and therefore affects the runoff concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Piezometer nests were installed at study sites in each of five
   north-south-trending end moraines of the late Pleistocene Oak Creek
   Formation in southeastern Wisconsin. The formation is composed primarily
   of a fine-grained glacial diamicton (till) and laterally continuous and
   discontinuous, coarse-grained lake and meltwater stream sediment. It
   overlies the Silurian dolomite aquifer, which is a source of drinking
   water to rural areas. The average vertical linear velocity and age of
   ground water in the Oak Creek Formation were estimated by three methods:
   Darcy's Law, environmental isotopes including H-3, delta-H-2, delta-O-18
   and C-14 (dissolved inorganic carbon), and solute transport modeling of
   O-18. The F-1 and Metro sites in the Tinley moraine showed excellent
   agreement among the three estimates of vertical velocity and showed the
   lowest velocity values (0.3-0.5 cm year-1 downward), which suggests that
   diffusion controls vertical mass transport at these sites. Although the
   extrapolated maximum age of ground water is 35 000 years, ground water
   below 75 m at these sites is probably not older than 15 000 years, which
   is the maximum age of the formation. Estimates of velocity showed less
   agreement at study sites in the Lake Border moraine system to the east
   and ranged from about 0.2 to 20.7 cm year-1; maximum groundwater age
   could range from 213 to 6000 years. Higher and more variable velocities,
   perhaps owing to thinner and more heterogeneous sediment in these areas,
   suggest that diffusion may not dominate vertical mass transport.
   Heterogeneity and fractures may also promote the development of
   groundwater flow systems dominated by lateral flow. Because of the
   uncertainty about the nature of groundwater flow, velocity, and age in
   the formation east of the Tinley moraine, future waste-disposal activity
   in southeastern Wisconsin should be confined to the thickest parts of
   the Tinley moraine near the present F-1 and Metro sites.}},

Abstract = {{The study used a monthly water balance model to examine the factors
   controlling the effects of climate change on catchments in the UK.
   Fifteen case study catchments representing a range of climatic and
   geological conditions were used together with a number of realistic
   climate change scenarios.
   The effects of climate change on average annual runoff depend on the
   ratio of average annual runoff to average annual rainfall, with the
   greatest sensitivity in the driest catchments with lowest runoff
   coefficients. The greater the concentration of a given annual rainfall
   change in winter, the greater the effect of that change on runoff.
   Several different empirical formulae gave results inconsistent with
   those from the monthly water balance model.
   Changes in monthly runoff are controlled by catchment geology and the
   current summer balance between rainfall and potential
   evapotranspiration. A catchment where summer rainfall is currently close
   to potential evapotranspiration shows the greatest proportional change
   in runoff in summer, whilst flows in catchments with large groundwater
   storages may be maintained even during warmer, drier summers if winter
   rainfall increases.}},

Abstract = {{The relation between mesoscale (the Kupa river catchment area,
   Yugoslavia) discharge and precipitation field anomalies and macroscale
   (European-Northern Atlantic Region) surface pressure anomalies is
   considered. For this purpose the principal component analysis (PCA)
   technique has been applied. Mesoscale monthly discharge values for 25
   stream flow measurement stations, precipitation and the Palmer `drought
   index' data for 18 weather stations as well as the macroscale surface
   pressure for 12 x 19 grid points have been used. All refer to the period
   1961-1980. Two principal components (PCs) are the most significant for
   each mesoscale field, which describe more than 85\% of total field
   variance. In addition to a significant correlation indicated between
   mesoscale discharge and precipitation anomaly and the Palmer `drought
   index' PCs, five space anomaly patterns were established for each field.
   A pattern of the macroscale surface pressure anomaly field corresponds
   to each of these patterns. Thus, an interpretation of the discharge
   anomaly field in the Kupa river basin in terms of macrocirculation is
   achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Various components of the water cycle in and around Abu Delaig, a small
   town in a semiarid region of Sudan, have been investigated with
   geochemical and isotopic techniques to determine the sources of
   groundwater recharge.  Rain samples (total deposition during storms)
   contain significant concentrations of dissovled solids for a continental
   site (mean 4.6 mg 1(-1) for 1982-1985).  The heaviest rains important
   for recharge tend to have the lowest chlorinities, and are also the most
   negative isotopically.  Wadi floods generally have lower chlorinity than
   the rainfall indicating the proportionally lower amounts of dust in the
   more intense rainfall events.
   Shallow ground waters at Abu Delaig have relatively evolved compositions
   (higher Mg/Ca ratios) compared with rainfall and wadi floods, yet they
   also contain tritium and retain isotopic signatures similar to the local
   rainfall.  They also have a distinctive chemistry compared with the
   deeper ground waters in the region and recharge from the former to the
   latter is considered to be insignificant.
   Ground waters in the unsaturated zone are saline and have isotopic
   compositions highly enriched in heavy isotopes compared with rainfall,
   indicating strong evaporation.  The chloride balance indicates that mean
   recharge rates are 0.2-1.3 mm year-1 through the interfluve areas.
   It is concluded that the only significant replenishable resources at Abu
   Delaig are from wadi recharge during floods and that direct regional
   recharge is insignificant.  Fluctuations in the water table, however,
   lead to solutes from the lower unsaturated zone contributing to the
   chemistry of the shallow ground waters.  Elsewhere it is possible that
   wadi recharge may be a possible route for deeper replenishment, but this
   needs to be demonstrated by dedicated experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Recent hydrologic research provides support for the regional groundwater
   flow systems concept.  The fundamental unit of such a concept is a
   vertical section in which three groundwater regions are distinguished,
   namely:  recharge, transition, and discharge regions.  Simulation of
   regional groundwater flow models has been devised using this concept. 
   This paper presents an investigation into the use of digital satellite
   data as a tool in identifying the potential of groundwater flow system
   areas.
   Digital radiance data collected by LANDSAT over Big Creek and Big Otter
   Creek basins in southern Ontario, Canada, have been utilized to
   delineate the principal groundwater regimes according to the proximity
   of the water table to the surface, i.e. discharge, recharge, and
   transition areas.  During the spring, the modulating influence of ground
   water on the near-surface temperature enables such a classification to
   be performed using only the near-infrared energy band of the satellite. 
   Such classification is directly comparable with thermal data collected
   by aircraft overflights of the watersheds.  During the summer months,
   however, the presence of phreatophytic vegetation throughout the
   watershed requires that the visible energy band data be used in
   conjunction with the near-infrared data to effect such a classification
   scheme.  The location of such groundwater flow systems provides valuable
   input to the hydrological modeling, the selection of sites for solid
   waste disposal and non-point-source modeling.}},

Abstract = {{A laboratory experiment on evaporation in various porous material layers
   was undertaken by applying a turbulent air flow to the exposed surface,
   to investigate the mechanism of the water vapor transport beneath a bare
   ground surface influenced by a turbulent surface wind.  Variation of air
   pressure within these layers was also measured.  Based on a physical
   model of water vapor transfer, an observed function decribing bulk
   resistance for water vapor transfer with evaporating front depth was
   investigated, using an observed power spectrum of the pore-air pressure.
   The model is based on the so-called turbulent mixing theory.  The
   following conclusions were reached.
   When porous material layers are of low permeability such as fine sand,
   water vapor transfer under the exposed surface occurs by molecular
   diffusion as well as by turbulent diffusion caused by variation of the
   pore-air pressure due to the turbulent surface wind (P-type).  The
   surface turbulence significantly affects the transport just beneath the
   surface.  Turbulent diffusivity near the surface is determined by
   horizontal and vertical fluctuating components of the pore-air pressure,
   but with increasing depth is driven only by the vertical component. 
   When the porous material layer is more permeable, water vapor transfer
   in this layer is analogous to that within a vegetation canopy (F-type),
   so that turbulent diffusivity decays exponentially with depth.  The
   turbulent diffusivity is a function of the mixing length.  The mixing
   length for F-type was of the order of the particle size.  For P-type the
   mixing length ranged from the particle size to ten times larger.}},

Abstract = {{Substantial field investigations of soil physical properties and
   stratification in a forested slope (10-degrees slope) covered with
   glacial till revealed that macropores in the form of old root channels
   as well as coarse structures in the form of well-sorted layers dominate
   a very permeable upper solid horizon.  Rapid response and quick
   recessions during snowmelt and heavy rains in 1986 were observed in the
   runoff from the slope.  Based on field tracer experiments it was found
   that such macropores and macrostructures played an important role on
   these occasions.  In order to verify these findings one-dimensional
   water and heat models were coupled in a serial manner to simulate the
   formation of runoff from the slope, using a quasi-two-dimensional
   approach.  Both a strict Darcian concept and a Darcian concept with a
   simple bypass flow concept introduced were tested.  The drainage gadient
   in the model was made equal with the angle of the slope.  Coupled slope
   simulations, with water retention properties and hydraulic
   conductivities taken from three different levels on the slope, indicated
   that the conditions in the lower region of the slope were most important
   in explaining the discharge rate.  With a shallow groundwater table in
   the lower region of the slope and low hydraulic conductivity of the
   deeper layers, rapid water flows are routed to the uppermost layers
   where the conductivity is higher.  Most of the flow is well described by
   Richards' equation, although smaller peaks cannot be represented for
   small rain events, when the measured runoff and recession showed a more
   rapid response than that simulated, however, the introduction of a
   simple bypass flow improved the ability of the model to simulate the
   observations.  Much of the simulated surface runoff generated in the
   Darcian simulation during the winter of 1986, could be diverted through
   a frost layer in the humus horizon and in the humus-impregnated mineral
   horizon with a silty-sand character, down to a more conductive and
   porous layer.  Eighty percent of the water flow in the bypass flow
   simulations was conducted in the upper 40 cm of the soil with peak
   intensities in the more porous upper 20 cm where the macroporosity was
   large.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the use of an integrated surface and groundwater
   modelling approach to estimate regional groundwater recharge rates.  The
   daily verison of the Monash Rainfall-Runoff Model, HYDROLOG, was adapted
   to represent the surface hydrological processes and the finite-element
   groundwater model, AQUIFEM-N, used to model the groundwater flow.  The
   integrated model was calibrated against streamflow and potentiometric
   head data, with recharge estimated as an output from the calibrated
   model.  The model was applied to both the irrigated and non-irrigated
   areas in the northern half of the Campaspe River Basin in north-central
   Victoria, Australia.  The integrated model utilises the important
   features of the surface and groundwater models.  It is useful in
   evaluating water resource development through better management of the
   conjunctive use of surface and ground water, and is an important tool in
   any predictive recharge study.}},

Title = {{RAINFALL INTERCEPTION BY TREES AND SLASH IN A YOUNG PINUS-RADIATA D DON
   STAND}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{131}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{187-204}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Rainfall interception by trees and slash was measured for 1 year in a 9
   m tall, 7-year-old Pinus radiata D. Don stand, thinned to 450 trees ha-1
   and pruned to heights up to 5 m.  Tree leaf and slash surface area
   indices, on a one-sided area basis, were 1.7 and 3.5, respectively. 
   Slash surface area was principally (about 90\%) comprised of leaves.
   A total of 1154 mm of rain was recorded on 163 days during 336 events. 
   Median event size and rainfall intensity were 0.8 mm and 0.4 mm h-1,
   respectively.  The measured fraction of rainfall intercepted by the tree
   canopy was 0.19.  Stemflow was linearly related to rainfall, with
   maximum values (for rainfall of 91.4 mm) of 6.3 and 7.6 mm for trees
   that had been pruned to heights of 2-3 m and 3-5 m, respectively.  Slash
   covered 60\% of the ground, with interception being 11\% of rainfall on
   a stand basis.
   Wetness sensors, located within the base of the tree canopy, were wet
   for 26\% of the time.  The fraction of wetness duration during darkness
   nearly coincided with the time fraction of dark hours.  This result and
   the equal probability of rainfall throughout the day showed the
   importance of night-time interception and evaporation.
   Estimates of stand aerodynamic conductance for water vapour transfer,
   derived from six night-time canopy drying events, were proportional to
   wind speed and varied from 0.05 to 0.33 m s-1 (corresponding wind speeds
   were 1.2 m s-1 and 6.0 m s-1, respectively).  During these events, there
   was no radiative energy so that evaporation was driven by convective
   energy, with vapour pressure deficit being typically 0.1 kPa.
   The effect of rainfall interception on the forest water balance was
   examined using a biophysical water balance model with parameters derived
   from the stand measurements.  Although there was generally satisfactory
   agreement between modelled and independently measured two-weekly soil
   water storage over the year, annual evaporation of rainfall intercepted
   by the tree canopy modelled with the Penman equation was only 9\% of
   rainfall (100 mm).  This is attributed largely to an underestimation of
   wet tree canopy evaporation during 15 days of higher-intensity rain when
   daily falls exceeded 20 mm.  For the remaining 148 rain days, modelled
   wet tree canopy evaporation was generally close to the measured 19\% of
   rainfall.  Modelled annual wet canopy evaporation emanating from the
   slash was 116 mm (10\% of rainfall).  Modelled annual tree transpiration
   and understorey evaporation during fine periods were 367 and 328 mm,
   respectively.  Annual soil drainage/water yield was 270 mm. 
   Implications for the management of water yield from forested catchments
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The streamwater chemistry of four catchments at Prades and one catchment
   at Montseny (NE Spain) is described and the relationships between
   streamwater alkalinity, pH and pCO2 with discharge and that between pH
   and alkalinity are highlighted.  At Montseny, results from a subsurface
   seepage are also presented.  The Prades and Montseny catchments have
   similar vegetation (dense forest of holm oak, Quercus ilex L.) and
   lithology (phyllites).  However, the catchments differ strongly in their
   hydrological behaviour:  only 8-15\% of the rainfall passes to the
   stream from the two gauged Prades catchments, whereas the Montseny
   catchment provides 50\% of rainfall to the stream.  Hence the
   mineralization of streamwaters is much higher in the Prades catchments. 
   All the streams studied show an inverse relationship between alkalinity
   and discharge.  Although pH also decreases with discharge in the
   Montseny catchment, it remains high during high flows in the Prades
   catchments.  The Prades streamwater chemistries are determined by the
   solubility equilibrium of calcite:  at high flows alkalinity decreases
   and, as a result of calcite solubility controls, this change results in
   an increase in pH.  Consequently, pH and log(alkalinity) are either
   negatively correlated or uncorrelated in the Prades streams.  At
   Montseny, the relationship between pH and alkalinity is significantly
   positive:  calcite solubility controls do not come into play.  All
   waters analyzed show an excess pCO2 (epCO2) with respect to atmospheric
   concentrations.  The highest epCO2 values usually correspond to low
   flows.  However, study of the variation of epCO2 during 15 individual
   storm events sampled at Montseny shows that epCO2 increases with
   discharge.  At Prades, the degassing of epCO2 in the stream channel
   produces calcite precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of steady groundwater movement in bounded unconfined aquifers,
   predicted from the analysis of horizontal seepage, are presented for
   various areal geometries in the form of maps showing lines of equal
   value of the seepage potential together with those of the horizontal
   seepage rate obtained from the gradient of the seepage potential.  The
   situation considered is that of a steady uniform flux through the water
   table due to rainfall or evaporation with a uniform seepage potential at
   the aquifer's boundary such as that imposed by water-filled ditches sunk
   to a horizontal impermeable barrier.  The maps reveal that there can be
   large areas where the horizontal seepage beneath the water table is
   practically uniform.  They also show that the flow into or out of an
   aquifer varies along the boundary depending on the geometrical shape. 
   Thus, for straight boundaries meeting at angles less than pi/2 the flow
   becomes zero at the corner but is finite for larger angles with the
   calculated result being infinite in some situations.  Such variations of
   seepage rate for different boundary shapes influence leaching and soil
   erosion.}},

Abstract = {{Partitioning among mobile and stationary water phases in a soil
   measurably reduces movement of a tracer relative to the mobile water
   phase.  The quantity of water infiltrating the soil, however, still
   follows from the product of the distance travelled by the tracer and
   average moisture content of the soil over that distance.  Partitioning
   between surface and water phases in a soil by proton and protium
   exchange has only a small effect on the retention of isotopically
   labelled water.  Partitioning between surface, water and gas phases in a
   soil, however, strongly decreases diffusive movement of isotopically
   labelled water in the gas phase.  In sandy soils with moisture contents
   less than 5\%, the effective diffusion coefficient in the gas phase can
   be reduced by a factor between 50 and 5000.  As a soil dries out,
   diffusive movement of O-18 labelled water will become larger than of HDO
   and HTO.
   Negative charges on soil surfaces repel chloride and bromide.  The
   effect of charge exclusion on movement of Cl- and Br- relative to HDO
   was measured in small columns for a number of soils from the southwest
   of Western Australia.  Data from these experiments show that in the
   unsaturated zone of sandy soils, charge exclusion can reduce the pore
   volume available to Cl- and Br- in the water phase at field capacity by
   > 20\%.  Recharge to ground water, if calculated from the position of
   Cl- or Br- tracers and average moisture in the soil profile, must then
   be reduced by the same percentage.
   The effect of charge exclusion in soils on the calculation of recharge
   from profile data, was evaluated for a practical situation.  Significant
   amounts of bromide from car exhaust gases accumulate in soils in urban
   areas and can be used to trace water movement.  A site was chosen in
   metropolitan Perth on a sparsely vegetated calcareous sand near the
   junction of two busy roads.  A seasonal effect on bromide accumulation
   in the soil profile at this site was clearly visible from data on the
   soil solution.  The distribution of bromide in the soil profile appears
   to correspond to 93\% of rainfall recharging ground water.  Correcting
   the data for charge exclusion, results in a calculated recharge of
   almost-equal-to 70\% of annual rainfall.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology has been developed to determine the optimal operating
   horizon for short-term reservoir operation.  The modelling procedure
   includes: (1) an adaptive forecasting algorithm; (2) a real-time
   reservoir operation model; (3) a multiobjective compromise programming
   algorithm.  The compromise programming algorithm utilizes a
   multiobjective compromise between the conflicting objectives of
   hydrologic forecast reliability and reservoir operation penalties.  The
   algorithm requires predetermined weights defining the relative
   importance of the two objectives.  This paper presents a risk-based
   methodology developed to help a decision maker in selecting the
   appropriate weights.  Reliability, vulnerability, and resiliency are
   used as three risk-based criteria for assisting in selection of the
   weights.  The methodology is presented in the form of a rule-based
   system designed to aid the user in the selection process.  The
   methodology is illustrated through an application of the technique to
   the operation of Green Reservoir in Kentucky.  The reservoir model is
   implemented for four different historical periods and its performance in
   terms of total penalties, reliability, vulnerability, and resiliency is
   presented as a function of the multi-objective weighting parameters. 
   The rule-based expert system is then used for deriving recommendations
   regarding the selection of appropriate weights.  The paper also
   discusses the rule-based expert system development tool, used in this
   research.}},

Volume = {{131}},

Abstract = {{In the Okefenokee Swamp, actual evapotranspiration (AET) should
   approximate potential evapotranspiration (PET) as there is rarely a
   moisture deficit.  Even during droughts, a high evapotranspiration rate
   is maintained owing to a large area of wetlands and a shallow
   groundwater table in the watershed.  Therefore, if AET can be estimated
   in the Okefenokee Swamp watershed, it can be used to evaluate the
   accuracy of PET estimates for the region.  In this study,
   temperature-based PET estimates were compared with AET obtained by the
   water balance method for the Okefenokee Swamp watershed.  Swamp water
   level data were used to identify subperiods with identical storage at
   the beginning and end of the period, so that a steady-state water
   balance model could be used to estimate AET as the difference between
   precipitation and outflow runoff.  When the PET estimates were regressed
   upon AET, Thornthwaite PET had the highest R2 value (0.817), followed by
   Blaney-Criddle PET (0.781), and Holdridge PET proportioned by
   biotemperature (0.768).  The Thornthwaite method also rendered a
   long-term average very close to that of AET.  Seasonal errors in
   Thornthwaite PET were reduced by using pan evaporation and temperature
   data to partition annual values into monthly values.  Holdridge PET
   overestimated evapotranspiration from the Okefenokee Swamp watershed. 
   Using standard crop coefficients, the Blaney-Criddle method would have
   overestimated evapotranspiration in the humid Okefenokee Swamp
   watershed.  However, by substituting a very low crop coefficient (K =
   1.5), the Blaney-Criddle method gave results for the Okefenokee region
   similar to those obtained by the Thornthwaite method with the lowest
   error among all the methods examined.  Pan evaporation correlated well
   with AET (R2 = 0.628) once an appropriate pan coefficient (0.71) had
   been determined.}},

Abstract = {{A radar-based short-term rainfall prediction model is formulated and
   evaluated.  The prediction lead time of interest is approximately 1 h. 
   The model is composed of a physically based component and a statistical
   component.  The physically based part performs mass balancing of mean
   vertically integrated liquid water content (VIL) under convective warm
   rainfall situations, using full-volume scan radar data, surface
   meteorological observations and upper air data.  The statistical part
   performs prediction of residual VIL.  Conversion of predicted VIL to
   rainfall is made using empirical relationships among VIL, rainwater
   content at cloud bottom, and echo-top height, which is assumed to remain
   constant over the prediction lead time.
   To evaluate the model, a comparison is made against advection-based
   nowcasting using radar data from the National Weather Service Radar Data
   Processor, version II (RADAP II) system at Oklahoma City.  Results from
   parameter estimation runs show that inclusion of the simple physical and
   statistical dynamics has potential in improving advection-based
   nowcasting under convective situations.  An apparent bias in mean
   rainfall prediction, however, suggests room for improvement.  Issues
   concerning possible improvements are described, and future research
   directions are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies of the acidic deposition phenomena have been focused on
   processes occurring in the northeastern USA and Scandinavia.  In these
   regions the soil cover is thin, the bedrock is acidic, and the terrain
   has very poor acid buffering capacity.  Most of the US Midwest,
   including northern Ohio, has been ignored because the terrain is covered
   by glacial sediments with an abundance of carbonate minerals.  Yet, for
   the last three decades the area has been experiencing acidic
   precipitation with a pH range of 3.5-4.5, the lowest in the USA.
   Samples of precipitation, soil water, and shallow ground water from
   Leroy Township in Lake County, Ohio, and from Wooster Township in Wayne
   County, Ohio, were analyzed and processed using WATEQ3 and PHREQE
   computer models to quantify the effects of the acidic deposition.  The
   two regions are characterized by very similar topographic, geological
   and hydrogeological conditions.  Although the cation content of the
   precipitation in both regions is similar, the anion concentrations are
   much higher (sulfate by 70\%, nitrate by 14\% and chloride by 167\%) in
   Leroy, located 50 km east-northeast and downwind of the Cleveland-Akron
   industrial complex, than in Wooster, located 80 km south-southwest and
   off-wind from the industrial complex.
   Computer modeling results indicate that buffering of acidic deposition
   in the surficial sediments and glacial tills of the two regions is
   dominated apparently by calcite dissolution and dissolution and exchange
   of hydrogen for magnesium ions are the dominant neutralizing processes. 
   However, reaction simulations also suggest that the buffering capacity
   of the Leroy soils and tills has been depleted to a much greater degree
   than in Wooster Township.  In Leroy more acidic input is reacting with
   less buffering material to produce lower soil and groundwater pH.  The
   depletion of carbonate and alumino-silicate minerals in the soils of
   Leroy Township is occurring at a rate that is 3-5 times faster than in
   the same type of soils in Wooster Township.}},

   the DBH. For trees which are not experiencing soil-water stress the
   daily transpiration rate of individual trees, q, is well represented by
   the relation: q = (6.6 +/- 0.3)g  (m3 day-1) where g (m2) is the tree
   basal area. On a unit ground area basis the transpiration rate,
   expressed as a depth per day is given by the relation: E(t) = (0.66 +/-
   0.03)G (mm day-1) where G(m2 ha-1) is the total basal area per hectare.
   For all the sites studied, although there is evidence for the `mining'
   of soil water as roots penetrate deeper depths in the soil each year,
   there is no evidence for direct abstraction from the water table.}},

Abstract = {{The Kuwait Group consists mainly of clastic sediments overlying
   unconformably the Dammam Formation of Tertiary age. The Kuwait Group is
   generally divided into three main hydrostratigraphic units: the upper
   and lower aquifers separated by an aquitard. The upper aquifer is
   further divided into the water table aquifer, an aquitard and a
   semiconfined aquifer. This semiconfined unit was pumped and the
   drawdowns were observed in piezometers screened in various subunits of
   the Kuwait Group. Some pumping tests of short duration were carried out
   in the top water table aquifer as well. These tests showed that the
   subunits of the Kuwait Group are hydraulically interconnected to a
   varying degree.
   The pumping test data were analysed using conventional analytical
   solutions. The semiconfined pumping test was also simulated by a
   quasi-three-dimensional model using a leaky multiaquifer modelling
   technique. The initial hydraulic parameters were improved manually in
   the model till best fit drawdowns were obtained.
   The final parameters obtained by simulation of the pumping tests were
   used in designing a pilot drainage system for the control of a rising
   groundwater table in parts of Kuwait City.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of predicting future short-term chemical behaviour in acidic
   and acid-sensitive streams is addressed. A relatively simple method is
   presented which combines a chemical technique for splitting the
   hydrograph into ground water and soil water components, based on the
   conservative component acid neutralization capacity, with the long-term
   hydrochemical model (MAGIC) in a `two-box' mode. This method, coupled
   with a chemical speciation program (ALCHEMI), is used to assess
   short-term variations in stream chemistry with change in atmospheric
   deposition chemistry. The method is applied for a semi-natural moorland
   catchment in mid-Wales (Afon Gwy). For both hydrogen ion and inorganic
   aluminium, the modelled stream mixing relationships are non-linear,
   particularly at low hydrogen ion concentrations. The results also show
   that the relationship between hydrogen ion and inorganic aluminium
   concentrations varies with time in the stream. This result has important
   implications as it implies that aluminium concentrations will not
   recover, with reduced anthropogenic sulphur deposition, as rapidly as
   has previously been thought. Two methods, for use with critical load
   evaluation of ecological stress, are presented for describing the
   changes occurring: the hydrogen ion and inorganic aluminium
   concentration duration curve; the hydrogen ion and inorganic aluminium
   incident frequency diagram.}},

Abstract = {{Macropores are a relatively small proportion of the soil volume. but
   they play an important role in the movement of water and chemicals owing
   to occasional rapid fluxes through them. The occurrence of macropore
   flow does not depend on the water content (or potential) of the bulk
   matrix unless the soil is close to saturation, but depends instead
   principally upon surface boundary conditions. Accordingly, three control
   situations of infiltration are recognized: macropore control,
   application control, and matrix control. These three situations indicate
   that the two-domain system may be a proper approach for the simulation
   of macropore soil. In this conceptualization, macropores are defined as
   channeling pores of different radii in which the flux density (with unit
   hydraulic gradient) occurring in the minimum sizes of such pores is
   greater than or equal to the saturated matrix hydraulic conductivity.
   Recognizing the two structural domains of the macropore and matrix, and
   possible water flow situations, three flow regions are suggested:
   matrix, macropore, and transaction. The matrix and the macropore are the
   two domains, and the transaction represents the exchange of water
   between the matrix and the macropore. The classic approach of the
   Richards equation is applicable to describe the flow in the matrix
   domain. The Hagen-Poiseuille and the Chezy-Manning equations for tube
   flow can be applied to represent the relationship between the hydraulic
   conductivity of the macroporosity and the total macroporosity, where the
   total macroporosity is defined as the ratio of the summed macropore
   cross-sectional area and the total soil cross-sectional area. An
   equation describing water flow in the macropore domain is then obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Description of flow in soils with macropores is difficult, yet quite
   important in describing the dynamics of field soils. Recognizing the two
   Structural domains of the macropore and matrix, and possible water-flow
   situations, three flow regions have been suggested: matrix, macropore,
   and transaction. The matrix and the macropore are the two domains, and
   the transaction represents the exchange of water between the matrix and
   the macropore. As a beginning point for the description of such systems,
   linear filter theory is applied to the Richards equation to obtain a
   general set of analytical solutions for water and contaminant movement
   in unsaturated soil in which there are no macropores. To develop these
   solutions, a unique relationship between water flux (q) and water
   content (0) is demonstrated by executing a numerical simulation based on
   the Richards equation. By piece-wise curve fitting of q(0), it is
   possible to establish and obtain a set of equations which describe water
   flow and chemical movement in soil, and which take the form of linear
   filter systems, providing analytical solutions by convolution. A
   two-domain approach applies equations for homogeneous soil to describe
   the matrix domain, with the macropore domain described with coefficients
   obtained by applying the Poiseuille and Chezy equations. These equations
   are analytically solved in correspondence with the three flow
   situations, resulting in a model, LASOMS (linear analytical solutions of
   macropore soils). Simulations, data and model comparisons of LASOMS have
   shown the above solutions to be reasonable under several conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Wetlands on the Vecht river plain in the Netherlands are threatened by
   pollution of ground water on the adjacent ridge `Het Gooi'. To assess
   the impact of this pollution, information is needed on the present
   groundwater flow pattern and hydrochemical processes occurring during
   flow. In the determination of hydrochemical processes past changes in
   flow patterns must be taken into consideration.
   Over the past 600 years impoldering and groundwater extraction have
   induced important hydrological changes in the study area. Exercises with
   a two-dimensional finite difference groundwater model were used to study
   the effects of these changes on regional groundwater flow patterns.
   Steady-state simulations along a vertical section were carried out for
   four different points in time, namely, the 14th century, 1885, 1941 and
   1985. Changes in flow patterns are inferred from a comparison of the
   steady-state simulations. The results indicate that groundwater flow
   changed from a simple pattern under natural conditions to a complex flow
   pattern dominated by artificially man-controlled hydraulic heads at
   present.
   The computer simulations are used to estimate the effect of changes in
   flow patterns on regional groundwater composition. Data on the
   distribution of chloride and oxygen- 1 8 in ground water provide a
   verification of the estimated effects and information on the present
   position of the fresh-brackish groundwater interface in the study area.
   Isochrones calculated by the model are used to estimate the position of
   this front where data on water composition are absent. The future
   displacement of the fresh-brackish groundwater front is inferred from
   the position of successive isochrones, assuming that the present flow
   pattern will remain in steady state.
   The computer simulations provide a general framework for the
   determination of hydrochemical processes in future studies addressing
   the impact of groundwater pollution on wetlands in the river plain.}},

Abstract = {{The use of electrical methods for estimating spatial patterns of
   groundwater recharge was evaluated at a field site in southeastern
   Australia. Here, recharge increased from less than 0.2 mm year-1 under
   native Eucalyptus vegetation, to between 1 and 14 mm year-1 under
   dryland agriculture. This increase in recharge results in progressive
   leaching of salts in the soil profile. Differences in recharge can be
   estimated from differences in depth of leaching. The estimated recharge
   rates are correlated with soil texture, with higher recharge rates
   generally occurring through sandier soils. The relationships of recharge
   to salt content and soil texture both contribute to lower apparent
   electrical conductivities for higher recharge rates.
   The effect of recharge rate on measured apparent electrical
   conductivities was modelled for various geophysical devices (including
   frequency-domain (FEM) and time-domain (TEM) electromagnetic instruments
   and direct current resistivity). The soil-texture effect was shown to
   have a greater effect than the solute leaching effect in determining the
   correlation between recharge and apparent electrical conductivity.
   Analysis of sensitivity to geological noise showed that variations in
   soil type below 2 m could disguise any correlation.
   Correlations between recharge rate, measured at core sites from chloride
   tracer techniques, and apparent electrical conductivity, measured with
   FEM electromagnetic devices. supported the conclusions of the model. For
   DC resistivity and TEM methods, correlations between recharge and
   apparent electrical conductivity were not significant, although for
   resistivity this may be due partly to the small number of measurements
   made. The FEM device most sensitive to variations in recharge had an
   operating frequency of 9.8 kHz. At lower frequencies the sensitivity is
   reduced. as the instruments are sensing 100 deeply. The poor
   correlations for TEM, as compared with FEM. are due probably to the
   relatively deeper penetration of the TEM instrument used in the study,
   rather than any inherent differences between the techniques.
   Because the major reason for the correlation between recharge and
   apparent electrical conductivity is soil texture, in this area the
   geophysical devices are mostly mapping soil type.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of the factors influencing infiltration and runoff was
   carried out using data obtained under simulated rainfall conditions on
   87 plots in arid and semi-arid areas of West Africa, arranged in a
   hierarchical sequence. One of the key factors to emerge from this
   typological classification is the type of surface crust. Together with
   faunal activity, vegetation cover and surface roughness, this parameter
   permits the inclusion of a `unit surface' factor in the classification
   system. Each unit surface is characterized in terms of genetic,
   morphological and hydrological properties.
   At a higher level, the combination of these unit surfaces allows a soil
   surface features unit' to be defined, based on an original mapping
   method. The samples, once defined in this system, were found to
   correspond to homogeneous criteria both in terms of evolution dynamics
   and hydrological behaviour. Furthermore, such cartography could be
   successfully extrapolated through remote sensing image analysis, making
   possible a classification of the runoff capability of small watersheds
   based on objective and standardized criteria.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic properties of deeply weathered basement rocks and variably
   weathered sedimentary materials were measured by pumping and slug-test
   methods. Results from over 200 bores in 13 catchments, and eight
   pumping-test sites across the eastern and central wheatbelt of Western
   Australia were analysed, Measurements were made in each of the major
   lithological units, and emphasis placed on a ubiquitous basal saprolite
   aquifer. Comparisons were made between alternative drilling and
   analytical procedures to determine the most appropriate methods of
   investigation.
   Aquifers with an average hydraulic conductivity of 0.55 m day-1 occur in
   variably weathered Cainozoic sediments and poorly weathered saprolite
   grits (0.57 m day-1). These aquifers are separated by an aquitard (0.065
   m day-1) comprising the mottled and pallid zones of the deeply weathered
   profile. Locally higher values of hydraulic conductivity occur in the
   saprolite aquifer, although after prolonged periods of pumping the
   values decrease until they are similar to those obtained from the
   slug-test methods. Hydraulic conductivities measured in bores drilled
   with rotary auger rigs were approximately an order of magnitude lower
   than those measured in the same material with bores drilled by the
   rotary air-blast method.
   Wheatbelt aquifers range from predominantly unconfined (Cainozoic
   sediments), to confined (saprolite grit aquifer). The poorly weathered
   saprolite grit aquifer has moderate to high transmissivities (4-50 m2
   day-1) and is capable of producing from less than 5 to over 230 kl day-1
   of ground water, which is often of a quality suitable for livestock.
   Yields are influenced by the variability in the permeability of
   isovolumetrically weathered materials from which the aquifer is derived.
   The overlying aquitard has a low transmissivity (< 1 m2 day-1),
   especially when deeply weathered, indurated and silicified. The
   transmissivity of the variably weathered sedimentary materials ranges
   from less than 0.5 m2 day-1 to over 10 m2 day-1, depending on the
   texture of the materials and their position within the landscape. Higher
   transmissivity zones may occur as discrete layers of coarser textured
   materials. The salinity of the saprolite and sedimentary aquifers ranges
   from less than 2000 mg l-1 to greater than 250 000 mg l-1 (total
   dissolved solids; TDS), depending on position within the landscape.
   Secondary soil salinization develops when groundwater discharge occurs
   from either saprolite or sedimentary aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{Krypton-85 was measured in air, soil gas, and ground water at the Borden
   aquifer in Ontario in October 1989. The measured specific activities in
   air and soil gas were 52.0 +/- 2.0 and 53.6 +/- 1.8 disintegrations per
   min (dpm) cm-3 krypton. These measurements are in excellent agreement
   with the global atmospheric trend and demonstrate that krypton-85 enters
   the water table at the Borden site without a lag in the soil ps
   reservoir. The krypton-85 specific activity in five groundwater samples
   ranged from 44.9 to 9.5 dpm cm-3 corresponding to groundwater ages of
   2-17 years with a monotonic decrease in specific activity (increase in
   age) along the groundwater flow path. Travel times calculated from a
   two-dimensional steady-state model of groundwater flow agree well with
   the krypton-85 ages in the main recharge region of the aquifer where
   flow is predominantly vertical, but were 30-40\% older than the
   krypton-85 age downstream of the main recharge area where the flow is
   mainly horizontal. The effect of dispersion on the distribution of
   krypton-85 was determined by modelling the transport of krypton-85 in
   the Borden aquifer with a two-dimensional time-dependent advection
   dispersion model using the steady-state flow field. Agreement between
   model specific activity and observed specific activity was excellent for
   samples in the main recharge region, but the model specific activities
   were 30-50\% lower than observed specific activities in the region of
   horizontal flow. The differences in travel times and krypton-85 ages and
   in model krypton-85 and observed krypton-85 specific activities are
   considered to be small given the heterogeneities that exist in the
   hydraulic conductivity and aquifer geometry and hence in the groundwater
   flow field. The model simulated krypton-85 distribution was not
   sensitive to changes in longitudinal dispersivity and was only weakly
   sensitive to changes in transverse dispersivity. The geochemical
   inertness, well-defined source function, and insensitivity to dispersion
   of krypton-85 allow estimates of groundwater age to be made in a
   straightforward manner and measurement of krypton-85 can significantly
   enhance the characterization -of groundwater flow in many shallow
   subsurface systems.}},

Abstract = {{A regional assessment of non-point-source contamination of pesticide
   residues in ground water was made of the San Joaquin Valley, an
   intensively farmed and irrigated structural trough in central
   California. About 10\% of the total pesticide use in the USA is in the
   San Joaquin Valley. Pesticides detected include atrazine, bromacil,
   2,4-DP, diazinon, dibromochloropropane, 1,2-dibromoethane, dicamba,
   1,2-dichloropropane, diuron, prometon, prometryn, propazine and
   simazine. All are soil applied except diazinon.
   Pesticide leaching is dependent on use patterns, soil texture, total
   organic carbon in soil, pesticide half-life and depth to water table.
   Leaching is enhanced by flood-irrigation methods except where the
   pesticide is foliar applied such as diazinon. Soils in the western San
   Joaquin Valley are fine grained and are derived primarily from marine
   shales of the Coast Ranges. Although shallow ground water is present,
   the fewest number of pesticides were detected in this region. The
   fine-grained soil inhibits pesticide leaching because of either low
   vertical permeability or high surface area; both enhance adsorption on
   to solid phases. Soils of the valley floor tend to be fine grained and
   have low vertical permeability. Soils in the eastern part of the valley
   are coarse grained with low total organic carbon and are derived from
   Sierra Nevada granites. Most pesticide leaching is in these alluvial
   soils, particularly in areas where depth to ground water is less than 30
   m. The areas currently most susceptible to pesticide leaching are
   eastern Fresno and Tulare Counties.
   Tritium in water molecules is an indicator of aquifer recharge with
   water of recent origin. Pesticide residues transported as dissolved
   species were not detected in non-tritiated water. Although pesticides
   were not detected in all samples containing high tritium, these samples
   are indicative of the presence of recharge water that interacted with
   agricultural soils.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental evidence is presented which shows that there exists a
   spatial scale over which ergodic assumptions are applicable for rilled
   hillslope surfaces. The property of expected spatial rill density (ESRD)
   is defined and this property is shown to stabilize after the averaging
   interval is more than 20 ft over the hillslope. The rilled hillslope
   geometry may be readily quantified in terms of this easily measurable
   quantity. The rill geometry has a significant influence on the surface
   distribution of overland flow and sediment transport- An analysis of the
   spatial scales suggests that a continuum representation may be utilized
   in modeling these hydrodynamic flow phenomena. For a complete
   characterization of the rilled hillslope geometry. the distributions of
   the rill widths and rill depths at various locations along the hillslope
   have been presented. These preliminary results show that the mean rill
   widths. the mean rill depths and the ESRD increase with increasing slope
   lengths. The distributions of the rill widths and rill depths suggest
   that these quantities may be modeled by truncated Gaussian or Gamma
   distributions at different spatial locations. The rill geometry
   properties may be related to hydrologic, and geomorphologic properties
   of the hillslope. It is suggested that the ESRD is a better descriptor
   of the rill geometry on the hillslope than the rill density because of
   the wide variations exhibited by the distributions of the rill widths.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{130}},
Number = {{1-4}},

Abstract = {{The US Geological Survey has maintained a network of stations to collect
   samples for the measurement of tritium concentrations in precipitation
   and streamflow since the early 1960s. Tritium data from outflow waters
   of river basins draining 4500-75 000 km2 are used to determine average
   residence times of water within the basins. The basins studied are the
   Colorado River above Cisco, Utah; the Kissimmee River above Lake
   Okeechobee, Florida; the Mississippi River above Anoka, Minnesota, the
   Neuse River above Streets Ferry Bridge near Vanceboro, North Carolina,
   the Potomac River above Point of Rocks, Maryland; the Sacramento River
   above Sacramento, California; the Susquehanna River above Harrisburg,
   Pennsylvania. The basins are modeled with the assumption that the
   outflow in the river comes from two sources-prompt (within-year) runoff
   from precipitation, and flow from the long-term reservoirs of the basin.
   Tritium concentration in the outflow water of the basin is dependent on
   three factors: (1) tritium concentration in runoff from the long-term
   reservoir, which depends on the residence time for the reservoir and
   historical tritium concentrations in precipitation. (2) tritium
   concentrations in precipitation (the within-year runoff component); (3)
   relative contributions of flow from the long-term and within-year
   components. Predicted tritium concentrations for the outflow water in
   the river basins were calculated for different residence times and for
   different relative contributions from the two reservoirs. A box model
   was used to calculate tritium concentrations in the long-term reservoir.
   Calculated values of outflow tritium concentrations for the basin were
   regressed against the measured data to obtain a slope as close as
   possible to 1. These regressions assumed an intercept of zero and were
   carried out for different values of residence time and reservoir
   contribution to maximize the fit of modeled versus actual data for all
   the above rivers. The final slopes of the fitted regression lines ranged
   from 0.95 to 1.01 (correlation coefficient > 0.96) for the basins
   studied. Values for the residence time of waters within the basins and
   average relative contributions of the within-year and long-term
   reservoirs to outflow were obtained. Values for river basin residence
   times ranged from 2 years for the Kissimmee River basin to 20 years for
   the Potomac River basin. The residence times indicate the time scale in
   which the basin responds to anthropogenic inputs. The modeled tritium
   concentrations for the basins also furnish input data for urban and
   agricultural settings where these river waters are used.}},

   standpoints. Finite element modelling of both saturated and unsaturated
   Darcian flow is considered, and examples are drawn from a particular

   frequent case of insufficient field data, it is suggested that suitable
   initial conditions include inference from slope discharges using the
   Dupuit-Forchheimer and Lynch methods, or the use of an approximately
   steady baseflow which can be achieved simply. In the latter case the
   hydrological run-in period can be considerably in excess of that
   necessary for solely numerical reasons. It is essential to use a
   suitable finite element mesh, particularly near the bottom of the slope

Abstract = {{A small (344 ha) experimental catchment in southwest Western Australia
   was partially deforested (western 53\% of the catchment) in 1976 to
   study the effects of agricultural development on water quantity and
   quality. The impact on the groundwater system in the cleared area was
   dramatic. Initial rates of rise were only 0.11 m year-1 but this
   increased after 10 years to average 2.3 m year-1. Groundwater rises of
   15 m in the valley and 20-25 m on the lower sideslopes were observed
   over 13 years. A small seep (groundwater discharge area) appeared for
   the first time in 1988 and by 1989 it covered an area of 1 ha.
   Streamflow initially increased by 30 mm year-1 (4.0\% rainfall) compared
   with a native forest average streamflow of 8 mm year-1 (1.0\% rainfall).
   However, since the seep area developed, the increase in streamflow has
   been 50 mm year-1 (6.6\% rainfall). Stream salinity was low prior to
   clearing (30 mg l-1 Cl-) and remained low for 9 years after clearing.
   However, since 1987, stream salinity increased dramatically as the
   ground water approached the ground surface, and by 1989 reached an
   annual average of 290 mg l-1 Cl -. The daily maximum in 1989 was 2200 mg
   l-1 Cl - compared with 92 mg l-1 Cl - from 1976 to 1986. The catchment
   changed from net salt accumulation pre-clearing to net salt export after
   1987. Thirteen years after clearing, the groundwater level, stream
   yield, stream salt load and stream salinity had not reached equilibrium
   but were all still increasing.}},

Abstract = {{A small (300 ha) experimental catchment in a high salt storage landscape
   in southwest Western Australia was subject to several different clearing
   treatments to determine their respective impacts on groundwater levels.
   Within subcatchments that were 60-70\% cleared, groundwater level rises
   were observed of 7.8-10.2 m compared with a 5.8 m rise with 32\%
   clearing and a 2.3 m fall in a native forest control, from 1977 to 1989.
   Under parkland clearing (leaving wide-spaced trees), the rate of
   groundwater level rise has declined in recent years in response to
   increasing crown leaf areas, and in contrast to other treatments (strips
   and block clearing) where groundwater rise has accelerated. The presence
   of a bedrock high at the valley invert within one subcatchment has led
   to substantial groundwater rises in recent years which could intercept
   the surface in the next 5 years if the current rates of rise are
   maintained.
   The combination of clearing treatments affecting 38\% of the catchment
   has resulted in a modest (13 mm) increase in catchment streamflow. This
   was over double the average forested streamflow. Stream salinity has
   remained low. Stream yield, stream salt load and stream salinity appear
   to be at an equilibrium. However, as a result of considerable expanses
   of clearing located close to or on the streamline or valley invert,
   there is a significant risk of salt discharge to the stream in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{Eight years of hydrochemical data are presented for streams draining
   beech forest, grassland and spruce forest catchments in the Mont Lozere
   region. The mean concentration of cations in the streams occurs in the
   order: beech forest < grassland < spruce forest. The broad changes in
   stream chemistry follow a synchronous pattern related to variations in
   climatic conditions. Stream chemistry varies only to a moderate degree
   with flow, though in fine detail concentration fluctuations are very
   complex during storm events: hysteresis is observed. Estimations of pCO2
   levels from the pH and alkalinity data show a wide scatter: the levels
   seem to be about five times the atmospheric value for all the streams.
   It is concluded that these catchments are still in an early stage of
   acidification. The spruce forest catchment acidifies faster than the
   woodland and the grassland catchments. Uncertainty remains as to the
   importance of air scavenging processes.}},

Abstract = {{In the carbonate aquifers which underlie most karst terrains,
   groundwater flow is through a dendritic system of solution conduits. In
   such aquifers, termed shallow conduit-flow aquifers. the methods used to
   mode) granular and fracture aquifers are not generally applicable.
   Investigations were conducted in the Inner Bluegrass Karst Region of
   central Kentucky with the objective of developing methods of modeling
   shallow conduit-flow aquifers as well as obtaining quantitative
   information on a specific portion of the aquifer to assist in its
   management for water supply purposes.
   In the Inner Bluegrass Karst Region, groundwater basins are developed.
   in each of which there is an integrated system of solution conduits
   which conducts recharge to a major spring. One of the largest of these
   groundwater basins feeds Royal Spring, which serves as the principal
   water supply for the town of Georgetown. The basin extends over 15 km to
   the southeast and most of its flow is furnished by underground
   diversions of Cane Run, a surface stream with headwaters near the center
   of the City of Lexington.
   The principal objectives of the field investigation were to determine
   discharges at the spring and travel times to the spring from discrete
   recharge points within the basin, termed swallets. The spring is
   ungaged. and an attempt was made to obtain a continuous discharge record
   by the dilution of dye introduced at a swallet. Comparison of the
   dye-dilution discharge record with stage discharges at the spring
   revealed substantial discrepancies which are believed to be caused by as
   much as five-sixths of the low-flow discharge from the upper portion of
   the basin bypassing the spring. The dye-dilution method, therefore,
   provided significant insights into the geometry of the conduit system of
   the groundwater basin although it proved unsatisfactory as a method of
   determining discharges at the spring.
   Analysis of the travel times and stage discharges provided information
   on the conduit geometry by modeling the flow as open-channel flow in a
   rectangular channel. Flow in the system is rapid, ranging from 140 to
   590 m h-1. Although the flow rate increases with discharge, the
   relationship is not simple owing to substantial increases in conduit
   cross-sectional area at higher discharges. Flow is turbulent and
   subcritical under all conditions. The most surprising result was the
   very low depth of flow calculated; less than 17 cm at even the highest
   discharge. Although this must be considered an `equivalent' depth, it is
   believed to indicate that active flow in shallow conduit-flow aquifers
   is generally in a thin zone just beneath the water table.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of temperature in soil-water transfer studies is usually
   neglected. However, experimental research has shown that there is a
   strong temperature effect on the characteristic soil hydraulic
   functions, such as the matric potential versus water content
   relationship, h(theta), and the hydraulic conductivity versus water
   content relationship, K(theta).
   The objective of this study was to examine whether this effect can be
   isolated and explained. For this purpose, experimental h(theta) and
   K(theta) values from two different sandy soils at temperatures of 20,8
   and 3-degrees-C, were directly compared with predictions obtained by
   both the surface-tension viscous-flow model of soil moisture movement
   (STVF) and the empirical Gain factor model extended to include the
   K(theta) relationship.
   Results showed that the predictive efficiency of the STVF method depends
   upon the soil type. For fine-textured material the Gain factor model
   seemed to perform satisfactorily. Finally, it was shown that unique
   normalized functions of both characteristic soil hydraulic properties,
   independent of temperature, can always be obtained.}},

   the coupled heat and mass flow distributed with depth whereas the

   used in both cases. Parameters are derived externally from the
   literature. The distributed model gives satisfactory results for all
   periods analysed. The performance of the bulk model depends on snowpack
   conditions. Particularly during freeze-thaw cycles, proper calibration
   of parameters appears to be essential. An analysis of the state

   model is not suited to a detailed simulation of internal processes.}},

Abstract = {{A physically based soilwater and heat model was used to estimate the
   water balance of an arable field in central Sweden for each of three
   different crop covers (barley with and without N fertilization and grass
   ley). Annual water balances were calculated for each year from 1981 to
   1985. On-site measurements of soil physical properties, meteorological
   variables and plant development were used as input to the model.
   Simulated soil frost, snow cover, soilwater contents, soilwater tensions
   and relative differences in simulated drainage between treatments were
   in agreement with the corresponding measured values. In the simulation,
   surface runoff (70 mm year-1 in all treatments) mainly occurred during
   snowmelt periods and accounted for much of the variation in the total
   runoff estimate. Annual mean precipitation amounted to 610 mm year-1,
   whereas average evapotranspiration was calculated to be 320, 360 and 435
   mm year-1 in barley without N fertilization, barley with N fertilization
   and grass ley, respectively. Soil evaporation accounted for 60, 43 and
   23\% whereas evaporation of intercepted water accounted for 5, 12 and
   19\% of the total evapotranspiration, respectively. Drainage estimates
   amounted to 205, 170 and 110 mm year-1.}},

Abstract = {{Stable isotopes of water were used to determine the hydrology of, and
   estimate the volume of groundwater discharge to, Bishop Creek in
   east-central California. The headwaters of the creek originate from
   three reservoirs at 2190-2975 m above sea level. Most of the water in
   Bishop Creek is diverted through a series of five hydroelectric power
   plants, resulting in streamflow that is less than that under natural
   conditions.
   The hydrogen isotopic composition of snow cores collected during this
   study ranges between - 189 and - 139 parts per thousand, and is more
   depleted than that of either the local ground water (delta-D between -
   137 and - 127 parts per thousand) or the tributary streams (delta-D
   between - 139 and - 126 parts per thousand) flowing into the upper
   reservoirs. The similar isotopic ratios of the local ground water and
   the small tributary streams flowing into the upper basin reservoirs
   indicate that the water collected from the upper basin tributaries
   originated as local ground water.
   The delta-D values of the upper basin reservoirs range from - 126 to -
   112 parts per thousand. Owing to evaporation, these values are more
   enriched than the delta-D values of the tributary waters, local winter
   snow and ground water. This stable isotopic difference, coupled with the
   diversion for hydroelectric power, allows an excellent opportunity to
   determine the locations of groundwater discharge, and, using an isotopic
   mass-balance method, measure that discharge to Bishop Creek.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical simulation of the contact zone between fresh water and
   salt water in the Rio Verde aquifer via two models leads to a
   satisfactory understanding of the development over time of a saline
   wedge. One of the two models is a finite-element model, taking both
   fluids to be immiscible; the other is a finite-difference model, which
   considers the zone as being a single phase of variable density. Whereas
   the latter, mass-transport model, gives more accurate information about

Abstract = {{The problem of axi-symmetric flow of two immiscible fluids is solved by
   use of the analytic element method. A sharp interface divides the flow
   into two domains with different but homogeneous fluids. The sharp
   interface is realistic for truly immiscible fluids, and is an
   approximation for miscible fluids such as fresh and salt water in
   coastal aquifers. A specific discharge potential is introduced which is
   discontinuous across the interface. The jump in the specific discharge
   potential depends both on the difference in fluid viscosity and fluid
   density. The discontinuous specific discharge potential is realized by
   use of a singularity distribution along the interface. For the case of
   axi-symmetric flow, the singularity distribution may be approximated by
   a set of either sink rings or vortex rings.
   The approach is implemented in a computer program, which is validated by
   simulating the movement of a spherical inclusion of one fluid in an
   infinite domain of another fluid, and comparing the results with an
   exact solution. Finally, the practical use of the program is
   demonstrated by simulating a saltwater upcoming problem underneath a
   partially penetrating well. The critical pumping rate for which the
   interface remains stable is determined and compared with both a
   laboratory experiment and numerical calculations reported in the
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{The methods of incorporation of historical floods and palaeological
   information into flood frequency analysis, and the usefulness of doing
   so, have been evaluated by many hydrologists. These evaluations are not
   in complete agreement. The results of a Monte Carlo study are presented
   comparing different simulation procedures and assessing the value of
   historical floods for at-site flood frequency analysis on the assumption
   of a Gumbel (EV1) distribution. It is shown that historical floods and
   palaeological information provide a useful source of information
   additional to the recorded series, and have great value in flood
   frequency analysis when floods are drawn from the Gumbel distribution.
   Simulation procedures based on type II censoring result in the largest
   bias and root mean square error in quantile estimation. This may be due
   to their assumption of type II censoring in the production of their
   simulated samples, an assumption that has some limitations. In the
   present work it was found that the type I censored-data maximum
   likelihood estimator is a robust model for the Gumbel distribution and
   that the type II censored-data maximum likelihood estimator performs
   poorly when the data are in fact obtained by type I censoring.}},

Abstract = {{The use of the peaks over threshold (POT) model described by the
   generalized Pareto distribution with Poisson arrival rate, which results
   in the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution for the annual
   maximum (AM) series for flood frequency analysis, is discussed.
   Estimation of the generalized Pareto distribution by the method of
   probability weighted moments (PWM) is formulated for both known and
   unknown thresholds. The effect of raising the threshold of the POT
   series on high quantile estimation is investigated. A comparison of the
   efficiencies of the POT and AM models in high quantile estimation is
   made. It is shown that the threshold of the POT series can be raised to
   a reasonably high level without affecting the efficiency of high
   quantile estimation. This property is useful in practice. When one
   cannot be certain that both small and large values in a sample are well
   described by a single simple distribution or that peaks are independent
   of each other, a relatively high threshold can be introduced to overcome
   these difficulties without reduction in efficiency. It is also shown
   that the POT and AM models are of similar efficiency even when a
   relatively high threshold is used for the POT series. It is suggested
   that there is no theoretical reason to use the AM model in preference to
   the POT model.}},

Abstract = {{In this study a simple general circulation model (GCM) is developed to
   investigate the interaction of atmospheric and hydrologic processes
   during droughts. Only the vertically and latitudinally averaged mean
   temperature and mean water vapor content over the strip of Earth between
   30 and 50-degrees-N latitudes are considered as atmospheric state
   variables; only two hydrologic state variables, the water storage
   (through the water balance equation) and ground temperature, are
   considered for describing the behavior of the hydrologic system. The
   ocean temperature is specified as a function of season only. The
   coupling between the atmosphere and the Earth's surface occurs through
   exchanges of thermal energy (radiation, sensible and latent heat fluxes)
   and of water (evapotranspiration and rain), which are parameterized
   functions of the four state variables of the atmospheric-hydrologic
   interactive system.
   Using this GCM, the mechanism leading to drought conditions is
   investigated. It is shown to be a non-linear positive feedback mechanism
   in the sense that it feeds on itself. Imposing a temperature wave over a
   geographical region (western USA in this study) for a short period of
   the order of few months induces geophysical conditions in that region
   which tend to reduce the hydrologic water storage for a period of time
   of the order of years (called `drought growth period'). These conditions
   consist initially of increased cloudiness over the region, which reduces
   the net radiative flux of energy available at the surface. This in turn
   reduces the evapotranspiration which is needed to achieve condensation
   conditions in the atmosphere. Consequently, a reduction in rainfall
   occurs. After the end of the drought growth period, the hydrologic
   system recovers the water storage mainly owing to decreased
   evapotranspiration (related to reduced water storage) while rainfall
   resumes its normal levels. The time duration necessary to return to the
   climatological average conditions of water storage (called `drought
   recovery period') is proportional to the peak drought severity during
   the growth period.}},

Abstract = {{Suspended-sediment loads are often estimated from an empirical relation
   between suspended-sediment load (L) and streamflow (S). This relation is
   usually defined as a power function, L = aS(b), and is referred to as a
   suspended-sediment rating curve. This function can be formulated as
   either a linear or non-linear model to find the solution of the
   rating-curve parameters (a and b). Formulation of the power function as
   a linear model requires a logarithmic transformation to linearize the
   function and a subsequent correction for transformation bias.
   Rating-curve parameter estimates for both the bias-corrected,
   transformed-linear or non-linear models can be obtained by the method of
   least squares.
   Each model has distinct advantages and disadvantages. A unique solution
   of the parameters of the transformed-linear model may be obtained
   algebraically. These parameter estimates have some optimal properties
   when certain attainable conditions are met. However, the parameter
   estimates must be corrected for transformation bias when obtained this
   way. Parameter estimates obtained for the non-linear model do not
   require a correction for transformation bias. However, these estimates
   must be obtained by iterative methods which do not always converge to a
   solution. In addition, the residual errors of the non-linear model
   typically are not identically distributed throughout the range of
   streamflow values. This problem adversely affects the precision of the
   parameter estimates. Weighted non-linear least squares can be used to
   improve the parameter estimates for the non-linear model, but the
   weights must be approximated and their appropriate form may be difficult
   to determine.
   A simulation study was done to evaluate: (1) the accuracy and precision
   of parameter estimates for the bias-corrected, transformed-linear and
   non-linear models obtained by the method of least squares; (2) the
   accuracy of mean suspended-sediment loads calculated by the
   flow-duration, rating-curve method using model parameters obtained by
   the alternative methods. Parameter estimates obtained by least squares
   for the bias-corrected, transformed-linear model were considerably more
   precise than those obtained for the non-linear or weighted non-linear
   model. The accuracy of parameter estimates obtained for the
   bias-corrected, transformed-linear and weighted non-linear model was
   similar and was much greater than the accuracy obtained by non-linear
   least squares. The improved parameter estimates obtained by the
   bias-corrected, transformed-linear or weighted non-linear model yield
   estimates of mean suspended-sediment load calculated by the
   flow-duration, rating-curve method that are more accurate and precise
   than those obtained for the non-linear model.}},

Abstract = {{The study deals with the chemistry of precipitation and runoff water on
   an arid limestone hillside (467 m2) the upper part of which is rocky and
   the lower part soil covered. Rainfall was measured with a rain recorder
   and sampled with a sequential collector which samples consecutive
   fractions of 2 mm. Runoff rate was measured with a stage recorder and
   runoff water was collected immediately after each flow from a collecting
   tank. Rain and runoff samples were analysed for their major
   constituents: Na+, K+, Ca2+ Mg2+, Cl-, SO42- and HCO3-. Rainfall during
   the study year (1981/1982) amounted to 75 mm. The salt input by rainfall
   was 8 g m-2. The salt output by runoff was 1.2 g m-2 for the rocky area
   and 0.5 g m-2 for the soil-covered area, indicating a substantial net
   gain for the different areas. Both rainwater and runoff water have a
   calcium bicarbonate composition. These two ions represent some 55\% of
   the dissolved ions. Runoff water is enriched by a factor of 2 in
   comparison with rainwater. Finally, the chemistry of runoff water from
   very small hillslope areas is quite similar to that of flood waters in
   the major channels of the Negev, pointing to a very limited chemical
   enrichment with increasing drainage area.}},

Abstract = {{This review of acid-deposition-catchment interaction follows from the
   Journal of Hydrology's Special Issue of August, 1990 (Volume 116). For
   some years acid deposition research has laboured under the constraint of
   a `politically correct' paradigm. Nevertheless, this review documents
   appreciable advances in the state of the science. These advances have
   led to the point where a paradigm shift is possible.
   Atmospheric acid deposition contributes to the acidity of catchments. It
   necessarily interacts with all catchment materials: organic, biological,
   and mineral. However, acid-deposition-catchment interactions need to be
   critically revisited and put into perspective with the fundamental
   knowledge of catchment biogeochemistry, geography and the effects of
   disturbance history possessed by other disciplines.
   Each natural acid-neutralizing and acid-producing mechanism ignored by
   popular acidification theory contributes to a cumulative overestimate of
   the importance of acidic deposition in catchment acidity.
   Previous research on catchment sulphur sources has been deficient to the
   degree it has accepted the paradigm that such catchments have negligible
   natural sources of sulphur. This cannot be so given the need ecosystems
   have for sulphur as an essential macronutrient, their adaptation to
   excessive amounts of it (i.e. ecosystems are leaky in respect to
   sulphur), the sulphur content of bedrock, and weatherability of
   sulphur-bearing minerals. Research needs to be initiated on all aspects
   of catchment retention of atmospherically deposited sulphur, especially
   enhanced retention by imperfectly drained terrestrial soils.
   Deficiencies in catchment sulphur cycle research are not random; they
   err cumulatively on the side of overestimating the importance of
   atmospheric sulphur deposition.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the effect of the Thomson weir and weirbox on
   measured recession curves. Small discharges can be measured accurately
   with a Thomson weir. The variation of the flow rate entering the weirbox
   changes the storage in the box, which thus gives a time lag in the
   measured discharge. Three cases of inflow were investigated: zero
   inflow, exponential recession inflow, and linear recession inflow, as
   predicted by the Zarmi model. Exponential and linear recession were
   described by differential equations, solved numerically through a
   predictor-corrector method. In most cases the time lag is less than 1
   min but at very low discharges the time lag can become important. The
   results presented indicate that the modifying effects of the weirboxes
   on the outflows from these catchments are not sufficient to explain the
   differences between the observed exponential recessions and the linear
   recessions predicted by the Zarmi model.}},

Abstract = {{A number of studies have used C-14 to estimate ages of unconfined ground
   water and to infer recharge rates. Some of these studies have been in
   arid or semi-arid regions, and the inferred recharge rates have been
   very low. The implicit assumption has been that the vertical movement of
   C-14 within the unconfined ground water is entirely by convective
   processes. In this paper we extend the ground water C-14 model of
   previous workers to include diffusion within the aquifer, and show that
   for recharge rates less than approximately 1 mm year-1, diffusion can be
   important in defining the C-14 distribution. For this reason it is not
   possible to use C-14 profiles to estimate recharge in these cases. We
   also show how neglecting diffusion can lead to serious underestimates of
   groundwater ages in unconfined aquifers where recharge rates are
   similarly low.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach has been developed to estimate the increase in

   the degree of leaching of chloride to quantify soilwater drainage below
   the root zone which ultimately leads to groundwater recharge. It is more
   general than similar previously reported techniques for analysing
   transient chloride profiles to infer recharge rates, and hence has wider
   application. We have applied the technique to a field situation in
   southern Australia where clearing of native vegetation for agricultural
   production leads to large increases in groundwater recharge. The

   difficulties in the application of solutes techniques to recharge

Title = {{PUMPING TESTS IN NONUNIFORM AQUIFERS - THE LINEAR STRIP CASE}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{69-99}},

Abstract = {{Many pumping tests are performed in geologic settings that can be
   conceptualized as a linear infinite strip of one material embedded in a
   matrix of differing flow properties. A semi-analytical solution is
   presented to aid the analysis of drawdown data obtained from pumping
   tests performed in settings that can be represented by such a conceptual
   model. Integral transform techniques are employed to obtain a solution
   in transform space that can be numerically inverted to real space.
   Examination of the numerically transformed solution reveals several
   interesting features of flow in this configuration. If the
   transmissivity of the strip is much higher than that of the matrix,
   linear and bilinear flow are the primary flow regimes during a pumping
   test. If the contrast between matrix and strip properties is not as
   extreme, then radial flow should be the primary flow mechanism.
   Sensitivity analysis is employed to develop insight into the controls on
   drawdown in this conceptual model and to demonstrate the importance of
   temporal and spatial placement of observations. Changes in drawdown are
   sensitive to the transmissivity of the strip for a limited time
   duration. After that time, only the total drawdown remains a function of
   strip transmissivity. In the case of storativity, both the total
   drawdown and changes in drawdown are sensitive to the storativity of the
   strip for a time of quite limited duration. After that time, essentially
   no information can be gained about the storage properties of the strip
   from drawdown data. An example analysis is performed using data
   previously presented in the literature to demonstrate the viability of
   the semi-analytical solution and to illustrate a general procedure for
   analysis of drawdown data in complex geologic settings. This example
   reinforces the importance of observation well placement and the time of
   data collection in constraining parameter correlation, a major source of
   the uncertainty that arises in the parameter estimation procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Several variations of a basic energy budget model were tested under
   varying atmospheric stability conditions using temperature data from
   Lake Mendota and meteorologic data from nearby Truax Airfield, Madison,
   Wisconsin. The flux enhancements predicted by Model 1 (Deardorff) for
   prevailing over-lake lapse conditions were inconsistent with measured
   changes in lake heat storage. When using the Budyko formulation for sky
   emissivity, epsilon, satisfactory energy residuals were obtained by
   eliminating the lapse enhancement while retaining the suppressive
   effects of over-lake inversions (Model 2 = modified Deardorff). Here,
   the best estimate of the 10 m Dalton coefficient was 1.45 x 10(-3) (cgs
   units; neutral profile). However, when the Koberg model for epsilon was
   adopted instead, satisfactory energy residuals were obtained only after
   eliminating all adjustments for non-neutral conditions, and increasing
   the 10 m Dalton coefficient to approximately 1.55 x 10(-3) (Model 3).
   Models 2 and 3 predicted annual evaporation from Lake Mendota of 71 and
   86 cm during 1977 (including approximately 6 cm of sublimation during
   ice cover), bracketing earlier estimates for this locality (76 cm) based
   on U.S. Weather Bureau Class A pan data, and consistent with intensive
   studies of Pretty Lake in northern Indiana. My estimates of the 10 m
   Dalton coefficient (1.45 x 10(-3) to 1.55 x 10(-3)) also narrowly
   bracket values for Lake Hefner and Lake Mead (1.49 x 10(-3)), obtained
   in studies by the U.S. Geological Survey. Moreover, as in the case of
   the Will Rogers airport near Lake Hefner, meteorologic data collected at
   Truax Airfield, Wisconsin, proved adequate for estimating sensible and
   latent heat transfer over the adjacent lake.}},

Abstract = {{Chloride concentration data from ten soil profiles in a 40 km2 area of
   the Chihuahuan Desert of Texas were used to assess chloride mass balance
   methods of evaluating moisture flux. The relative importance of
   advective and diffusive transport mechanisms was determined. Moisture
   fluxes were calculated from measured chloride concentrations on the
   basis of a steady-state flow model. To evaluate controls on unsaturated
   flow, moisture fluxes from this study were compared with those from
   other regions.
   The chloride profiles displayed large variations in concentrations and
   had: (1) low chloride concentrations (less-than-or-equal-to 100 g m-3)
   near land surface; (2) maximum chloride concentrations (1900-9300 g m-3)
   at depths of from 1.3 to 4.6 m; (3) gradually decreasing chloride
   concentrations with depth below the peak. Steep concentration gradients
   (up to 12000 g m-3 m-1), characteristic of chloride profiles in these
   desert soils, indicate a potential for molecular diffusion; however, low
   moisture contents (less-than-or-equal-to 0.1 m3 m-3) in the zone of
   steep concentration gradients resulted in diffusive fluxes that were two
   to three orders of magnitude lower than the advective fluxes; therefore,
   diffusive fluxes were neglected in flux calculations. Because the
   chloride accession rate was assumed to be constant throughout the study
   area, calculated moisture fluxes are inversely proportional to chloride
   concentrations in the soil water. Highest moisture fluxes (up to 6 mm
   year-1) were calculated near land surface and are related to chloride
   leaching as a result of precipitation. Within the upper meter of the
   unsaturated zone, soil moisture fluxes decreased sharply to 0.1 mm
   year-1 as most of the water evapotranspired in this zone. Soil moisture
   fluxes decreased to a minimum at the chloride peak and then increased
   gradually as chloride concentrations decreased with depth below the
   peak. Reductions in chloride concentrations below the peak are
   attributed to differences in moisture fluxes as a result of
   paleoclimatic variations. Comparisons of chloride profiles from
   different regions indicate that geomorphic setting plays a major role in
   controlling moisture flux in the unsaturated zone.}},

Abstract = {{A field test was conducted at the Hanford site in south-central
   Washington State to assess the effects of drilling and complex drilling
   fluids on hydrochemical sampling results. Changes in groundwater
   chemistry from a pre-test baseline were related to the various fluid
   components. Chemical species having a source in one or more of the fluid
   additives increased in concentration, while those not having a source in
   the fluid decreased in concentration as a result of dilution within the
   formation. Isotopic species, primarily delta-C-13 and C-14, were
   dramatically affected by the high carbon content of the drilling fluids.
   The use of complex drilling fluids similar to those used in this test
   severely limits the usefulness of these environmental isotopes.
   Attenuation of drilling fluid components in the formation appeared to
   occur by physical as well as chemical mechanisms. Mass balance
   calculations indicated that extensive borehole development was required
   before most fluid components were removed from the formation.
   Tracers added to, or which were components of, the drilling fluids, were
   used to evaluate the efficacy of well development. It was concluded
   that: (1) a 1000-fold decrease in tracer concentration (C/C0 = 10(-3))
   or a development ratio (development volume divided by volume lost during
   drilling) of 100 is required for many trace constituents; (2)
   significantly lower development ratios may be adequate for major
   chemical constituents or in cases where the solute concentration is
   greater in the formation fluid than in the drilling fluid; (3) extensive
   development (a development ratio of greater than 100) may be required
   for certain isotopic species (C-14, Cl-36, I-129, etc.). Unless drilling
   fluid losses are controlled to less than a few thousand liters in the
   latter case, or a non-contaminated source of drilling fluid is used, the
   required development may be impractical and/or cost prohibitive.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal variations in the oxygen-18 and deuterium composition of New
   Delhi rainfall (1961-1983) have been analysed using statistical
   correlations. Although long-term values agree with the `world meteoric
   line', short-term features can be seen following an evaporation line.
   Rainfall in the monsoon months (June-September) seems to be undergoing
   evaporation and subsequent isotopic enrichment during the course of its
   fall. The isotopic composition of rainfall events of less than 30 mm
   show deviation from the meteoric line. The isotopic composition and
   deuterium excess values appear to be governed by the intensity and
   distribution of rainfall and the trajectory of the moist air-mass
   movement. The long-term mean temperature and mean rainfall together
   account for about 80-95\% of the long-term average variability of O-18
   composition. Lack of correlation between monthly isotopic composition
   and rainfall reflects the possible impact of atmospheric circulation
   patterns on rainfall isotope contents. The necessity of isotope
   modelling of moist air-mass circulation is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy and precision of phosphorus load estimates from two
   agricultural drainage basins in western Finland were evaluated, based on
   continuous flow measurements and frequent flow-proportional sampling of
   total phosphorus concentration during a 2 year period. The objective was
   to compare different load calculation methods and to evaluate
   alternative sampling strategies. An hourly data set of concentrations
   was constructed by linear interpolation, and these data were used in
   Monte Carlo runs for producing replicate data sets for calculating the
   accuracy and precision of load estimates. All estimates were compared
   with reference values computed from the complete hourly data sets. The
   load calculation methods based on summing the products of regularly
   sampled flows and concentrations produced the best precision, whereas
   the best accuracy was achieved using methods based on multiplying annual
   flow by flow-weighted annual mean concentration. When comparing
   different sampling strategies, concentrating sampling in high runoff
   periods (spring and autumn) was found to give better accuracy and
   precision than strategies based on regular interval sampling throughout
   the year. However, the best result was obtained by taking samples
   flow-proportionally within the highest peak flows plus additional
   regular interval (e.g. biweekly) samples outside these flow peaks. Using
   this strategy, which calls for automatic sampling equipment, accuracies
   better than 5\% and precisions better than 10\% can be achieved with
   only 30-50 samples year-1.}},

Abstract = {{Although the Eastern Province of Kenya is arid to semi-arid with limited
   surface water resources, little is known about the groundwater
   resources. We interpreted environmental-isotope (oxygen-18, deuterium,
   tritium) concentrations in selected groundwater supplies, streams, and
   springs to determine where, when, and how recharge occurs. The ground
   water in the Eastern Province is recharged from rainfall, which, except
   for selected highland areas, has undergone significant evaporation
   during the precipitation process. Ground water recharges directly from
   rainfall in the more humid highland areas whereas in drier lowland
   areas, recharge is from ephemeral streams and possibly by lateral
   groundwater flow from high areas. Based on a comparison of deuterium and
   chloride concentrations, groundwater recharge appears to be rapid with
   little further evaporation. Ground water with post 1953 recharge is
   common in the dry northeast but surprisingly rare in the humid highlands
   in the south.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to determine: (1) the degree of seal
   development at incipient ponding, and (2) the relationship between the
   hydraulic conductance of developing seals and rainstorm characteristics,
   i.e. the rain intensity and kinetic energy rate. Laboratory columns of
   an Atwood soil (Typic Paleudalf) were subjected to rainstorms with
   different combinations of duration, intensity, and kinetic energy rate.
   Seal conductance was determined from measured infiltration data and a
   solution of the Richards' equation for vertical infiltration through an
   infinitely thin seal. The results show that the hydraulic conductance of
   the sealing zone decreased rapidly during early stages of rainfall
   commencing before incipient ponding. The analyses indicate that for
   storms of relatively brief duration (less than 2 h) the hydraulic
   conductance of the sealing zone depends on the cumulative rainfall
   energy and on the rainstorm intensity.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical algorithm is developed to determine the depth-dependent
   profiles of specific storage and hydraulic conductivity resulting from
   overburden stress in horizontally isotropic artesian aquifers. Vertical
   variations in the void ratio of the aquifer matrix brought about by
   overburden stresses determine the pore-volume compressibility and matrix
   permeability at specific depths within the aquifers which, in turn,
   determine the depth-dependent profiles of specific storage and hydraulic
   conductivity. Time-drawdown curves are obtained for two sands subjected
   to different overburden stresses. For shallow artesian aquifers with low
   overburden stress and high aquifer matrix compressibility, noticeable
   vertical gradients in specific storage occur. These vertical gradients
   cause deviations from the classical time-drawdown curves defined by the
   Theis solution. These deviations are negligible for deep artesian
   aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were conducted using two soils (Bassendean sand
   and Collie loam) in the unsaturated state to investigate the effect of
   the mode of water application (steady state versus intermittent) on the
   leaching of a pulse of conservative tracer (bromide). With the same
   amount of water applied for leaching, the downward movement of the
   solute peak was found to be significantly different under the two
   conditions. This difference could be ascribed to different effective
   soilwater contents during leaching as well as to different modes of
   water application. The comparisons made at similar average soilwater
   content showed that the movement of the solute peak was much faster
   under the steady state than the intermittent application. These
   intermittent effects were probably caused by hysteresis, and were more
   pronounced in the loam than the sand. The implications of these results
   to the field application of models for predicting solute transport in
   general, and to the estimation of recharge using tracers in particular,
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Computer-based curve fitting of the Theis equation can be achieved by
   specifying the location of two points on a curve sketched or visualised
   through drawdown data from an observation well penetrating a confined
   aquifer. Any given pair of points generates unique estimates of
   storativity and transmissivity, which are calculated by locating the
   zero of a simple function.
   This approach is readily extended to observation well data when the
   later drawdowns are influenced by a single linear aquifer boundary
   (zero-flux or constant head). Specifying three points on the visualised
   curve allows an estimate to be made of the distance to the image well.
   Estimation in the presence of linear boundaries can also be achieved
   with drawdowns from a pumped well.
   Examples of the method are illustrated using drawdown data both with and
   without a linear boundary influence.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional modeling scheme is utilized herein to analyze the
   effects of mined out underground openings on groundwater flow patterns
   in unsaturated rocks. A series of modeling results is presented using
   the finite element computer program UNSAT2 to simulate steady
   groundwater flow that initially is vertical and downward. Model output
   is analyzed for: (1) variations in the direction of groundwater flow
   caused by the mined out openings; (2) the distribution of pressure head
   as produced by the openings; (3) variables that affect the rate of
   predicted groundwater inflow into the openings.
   Modeling results indicate that: (1) mined out openings will alter the
   pattern of groundwater flow in the unsaturated zone; (2) the hydraulic
   effects are dependent on the hydrogeology of the rocks and on the
   geometry of the mined out openings; (3) inflow of groundwater into mined
   out openings is possible in the otherwise unsaturated zone, including
   mines developed in homogeneous rocks; (4) groundwater inflow into the
   mined out openings can occur at values of downward flux that are smaller
   in magnitude than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the
   surrounding rock; (5) the temporal and spatial distribution of flux
   through the Topopah Spring Member of the Paintbrush Tuff is the most
   critical factor regarding the occurrence of mine water inflow in the
   otherwise unsaturated tuff at Yucca Mountain, ND, U.S.A.}},

Abstract = {{A primary source of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the Black Creek
   aquifer of South Carolina is carbon dioxide produced by microbially
   mediated oxidation of sedimentary organic matter. Groundwater chemistry
   data indicate, however, that the available mass of inorganic electron
   acceptors (oxygen, Fe(III), and sulfate) and observed methane production
   is inadequate to account for observed CO2 production. Although sulfate
   concentrations are low (approximately 0.05-0.10 mM) in aquifer water
   throughout the flow system, sulfate concentrations are greater in
   confining-bed pore water (0.4-20 mM). The distribution of culturable
   sulfate-reducing bacteria in these sediments suggests that this
   concentration gradient is maintained by greater sulfate-reducing
   activity in sands than in clays. Calculations based on Fick's Law
   indicate that possible rates of sulfate diffusion to aquifer sediments
   are sufficient to explain observed rates of CO2 production (about 10(-5)
   mmoll-1 year-1), thus eliminating the apparent electron-acceptor
   deficit. Furthermore, concentrations of dissolved hydrogen in aquifer
   water are in the range characteristic of sulfate reduction (2-6 nM),
   which provides independent evidence that sulfate reduction is the
   predominant terminal electron-accepting process in this system. The
   observed accumulation of pyrite- and calcite-cemented sandstones at

   have been continuing over the history of these sediments.}},

Abstract = {{Stable isotope data for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), carbonate
   shell material and cements, and microbial CO2 were combined with organic
   and inorganic chemical data from aquifer and confining-bed pore waters
   to construct geochemical reaction models along a flowpath in the Black
   Creek aquifer of South Carolina. Carbon-isotope fractionation between
   DIC and precipitating cements was treated as a Rayleigh distillation
   process. Organic matter oxidation was coupled to microbial fermentation
   and sulfate reduction. All reaction models reproduced the observed
   chemical and isotopic compositions of final waters. However, model 1, in
   which all sources of carbon and electron-acceptors were assumed to be
   internal to the aquifer, was invalidated owing to the large ratio of
   fermentation CO2 to respiration CO2 predicted by the model (5-49)
   compared with measured ratios (two or less). In model 2, this ratio was
   reduced by assuming that confining beds adjacent to the aquifer act as
   sources of dissolved organic carbon and sulfate. This assumption was
   based on measured high concentrations of dissolved organic acids and
   sulfate in confining-bed pore waters (60-100-mu-M and 100-380-mu-M,
   respectively) relative to aquifer pore waters (from less than 30-mu-M
   and 2-80-mu-M, respectively). Sodium was chosen as the companion ion to
   organic-acid and sulfate transport from confining beds because it is the
   predominant cation in confining-bed pore waters. As a result, excessive
   amounts of Na-for-Ca ion exchange and calcite precipitation (three to
   four times more cement than observed in the aquifer) were required by
   model 2 to achieve mass and isotope balance of final water. For this
   reason. model 2 was invalidated. Agreement between model-predicted and
   measured amounts of carbonate cement and ratios of fermentation CO2 to
   respiration CO2 were obtained in a reaction model that assumed confining
   beds act as sources of DIC, as well as organic acids and sulfate. This
   assumption was supported by measured high concentrations of DIC in
   confining beds (2.6-2.7 mM). Results from this study show that
   geochemical models of confined aquifer systems must incorporate the
   effects of adjacent confining beds to reproduce observed groundwater
   chemistry accurately.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term hydrographs for deep confined aquifers in southern
   Saskatchewan, Canada, show annual fluctuations characterized by a
   gradual rise in head from October to May/June and a rapid drop from
   May/June to October. These fluctuations are distinctly different from
   the seasonal fluctuations observed in surficial and shallow
   semi-confined aquifers, which reflect the response of these aquifers to
   recharge derived from snow melt and early spring rains. On the basis of
   field data and theoretical considerations, it is demonstrated that
   seasonal fluctuations of the water table are not transmitted down to the
   deep aquifers, provided the confining layers are thick and have
   sufficiently low hydraulic diffusivity. The annual fluctuations in the
   deep aquifers thus do not reflect seasonal recharge to these aquifers.
   Plots of moisture accumulation (i.e. precipitation minus calculated
   areal evapotranspiration) are strikingly similar to the observed
   hydrographs for the deep aquifers, in timing and magnitude of the annual
   fluctuations. It is postulated that the annual head fluctuations in the
   deep confined aquifers reflect changes of the mechanical load on the
   formations, caused by seasonal changes of the soil moisture, snow, and
   storage at the water table. The deep confined aquifers thus act as
   large-scale, inexact, weighing lysimeters.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates groundwater recharge on an alluvial fan in Quetta
   Valley (Baluchistan, Pakistan), through deep stony soils with limited
   data of soil texture, soil profile descriptions, water-table depths and
   meteorological variables. From the soil profile descriptions, a
   representative profile was constructed with typical soil layers. Next,
   the texture of each layer was compared with textures of soils with known
   soil physical characteristics; it is assumed that soils from the same
   textural class have similar water retention and hydraulic conductivity
   curves. Finally, the water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves
   were transformed to account for the volume of stones in each layer; this
   varied between 0 and 60 vol. \%. These data were used in a transient
   finite difference model and in a steady-state analytical solution to
   evaluate the travel time of the recharge water and the maximum annual
   recharge volume. Travel times proved to be less sensitive to differences
   in soil physical characteristics than to differences in annual
   infiltration rates. Therefore, estimation of soil physical
   characteristics from soil texture data alone appears justified for this
   study. Estimated travel times on the alluvial fan in the Quetta Valley
   vary between 1.6 years, through a soil profile of 25 m with an
   infiltration rate of 120 cm year-1, to 18.3 years through a soil profile
   of 100 m with an infiltration rate of 40 cm year-1. When the
   infiltration rate of the soil exceeds 40 cm day-1, the infiltration
   process proceeds so fast that evaporation losses are small. If the depth

Abstract = {{One of the simplest ways of determining the dimensions of and
   controlling water resources is by comparison of some water shortage
   index with an upper limit value, called water deficiency tolerance,
   based on economic considerations. The situation is considered
   satisfactory if water shortage is smaller than the limit value.
   Otherwise the dimensions and operating rules of system elements (such as
   the volumes of storage reservoirs and water intakes) have to be changed.
   Earlier workers gave several indices of water shortage and showed their
   calculation when water demand is a constant value and water resources
   are characterized by a probability distribution function. Methods for
   the calculation of water shortage indices in this particular case have
   been given.
   Indices of water shortage when water demand is not constant but a
   stochastic or deterministic relation exists between water demand and
   resources are examined.
   Indices characterizing the concomitance of two arbitrary random
   variables are considered. Flow discharges and water consumption of the
   Tisza basin provide examples of their use.
   The calculation of water shortage indices depends on the relationship
   between resources and demands: (a) If the relation between water
   resources and demand is stochastic, water shortage indices should be
   calculated either directly from the time functions of the two variables
   (by computer) or from their joint frequency function, by simple
   formulae; (b) if there is a deterministic functional monotonic,
   non-increasing relationship of unknown form, the water balance may be
   based on the duration functions of the two variables; (c) Finally, if
   the relationship between water resources and demand is known. the water
   shortage index can be calculated from a simple formula and the
   distribution function of water resources.}},

Abstract = {{A small forested catchment in southwest Western Australia was thinned to
   study the effect on hydrology, wood production and disease escalation.
   This paper deals primarily with the hydrological aspects. The uniform,
   intensive thinning treatment reduced crown cover from 60 to 14\%, which
   resulted in an increase in streamflow of approximately 20\% of annual
   rainfall (260 mm for an average year) after 3 years, compared with a
   streamflow yield of 6\% of annual rainfall before thinning. The deep
   groundwater attained a new equilibrium after 2 years, rising by
   approximately 2 m in the area adjacent to the swamp, and by 5 m upslope.
   The ephemeral shallow groundwater system expanded in duration from 2
   months per year pre-treatment to approximately 6 months per year after
   thinning. The major components of streamflow generation present before
   thinning remained as the major components after thinning. The expansion
   of the saturated source area and the presence of a shallow groundwater
   system for extended periods, as a result of an increase in available
   water from the reduction in interception and evaporation from the
   overstorey, were considered to be the major causes of increased
   streamflow.}},

   process on steep hillslopes subjected to time-varying rainfall events.
   The erosion equation is essentially represented as a first-order
   reaction with the reaction rate being represented by the soil
   erodibility. The  analytical transient solutions are based upon the
   assumption that the flow and sediment discharge have a constant
   relationship as during steady-state conditions. The analytical solution
   for the sediment discharge performs well when compared with numerical
   and experimental results. The approximate analytical solution for the
   concentration profile is the asymptotic limit of the transient numerical
   solutions. An error analysis shows that the analytical solutions improve
   with increasing slope length and that the solution model presented here
   is applicable to a wide range of physical situations.}},

Abstract = {{The 110 km2 Antelope Island is predominantly composed of Precambrian
   gneiss similar to rocks in the Wasatch Range 32 km to the east. Three
   types of island groundwater systems have been identified on the basis of
   aquifer composition and dissolved solute content. The systems include
   ground waters which discharge from either crystalline or sedimentary
   rocks. Sedimentary groundwater systems contain ground water which is
   either Na-Cl rich or poor. All island ground water has anomalously high
   Na+, Cl-, or SO42-concentrations when compared with ground waters that
   issue from similar bedrock in nearby areas. Island groundwater systems
   may be statistically distinguished from each other and from other ground
   water in the region.
   The solute chemistry of island ground water cannot be accounted for by
   the simple dissolution of aquifer minerals, and the water does not plot
   along fault controlled thermal water-precipitation or parent
   aquifer-precipitation Cl-/SO42- mixing lines. Discharge elevations and
   Cl-/SO42- also rule out mixing with residual salts from paleo Lake
   Bonneville or brines of the Great Salt Lake for most island ground
   water.
   Tritium values (> 40 tritium units (TU)) suggest that island groundwater
   systems are primarily recharged from modern meteoric water. Stable
   isotopic delta-H-2 and delta-O-18 data plot along an evaporation line
   which indicates that recharge water contains a component of evaporated
   Great Salt Lake water. Temporal variations in spring discharges, tritium
   concentrations, and discharge temperatures of less than 20-degrees-C
   indicate short flow paths and shallow circulation. Excess Cl- and SO42-
   concentrations are attributed to the deposition of aerosols of
   wind-blown dust from nearby evaporate deposits and sea spray. Sulfur
   isotope data suggest contributions to crystalline systems of reduced
   sulfur from nearby smelter or other industrial plumes.}},

   inherent heterogeneity critical factors controlling denitrification

Abstract = {{Integrated studies of geohydrology, geochemistry, and geology of
   crystalline rocks in the vicinity of Conifer, Colorado, reveal that
   radon concentrations do not correlate with variations in concentrations
   of other dissolved species. Concentrations of major ions show systematic
   variations along selected ground-water flowpaths, whereas radon
   concentrations are dependent on local geochemical and geologic phenomena
   (such as localized uranium concentration in the rock or the presence of
   faults or folds). When radon enters the flow system, concentrations do
   not increase along flowpaths because its decay rate is fast relative to
   groundwater flow rates. Radon-222 is not in secular equilibrium with
   U-238 and Ra-226 in the water. Therefore, most of the U-238 and Ra-226
   necessary to support the waterborne Rn-222 must be present locally in
   the rock. High concentrations of dissolved radon are not found in zones
   of high transmissivity, and transmissivity is not correlated with rock
   type in the study area. A higher transmissivity can be indicative of
   higher water-volume to rock-surface-area ratios, which could effectively
   dilute Rn-222 entering the water and/or may indicate that emanated radon
   is carried away more rapidly. Water samples collected from individual
   wells over periods of several months showed significant fluctuations in
   the dissolved Rn-222 content. This fluctuation may be controlled by
   changes in the contributions of water-producing zones within the well
   resulting from seasonal fluctuations of the water table and/or pumping
   stresses.}},

   presented and reviewed with the intention to show the historical
   developments made around 1940.  The diffusion process from a clayey and
   saline lake bottom towards fresh supernatant water proved to be
   influenced by slow upward or downward groundwater currents.  The
   deviations from the expected diffusion profiles, as observed during the
   period 1936-1938, could be used to find the velocities of such currents,
   even if they are as low as 10 mm year-1.  There were areas where water
   from the underlying Pleistocene aquifer discharged into the lake, and
   elsewhere lake water infiltrated to recharge the aquifer.  The
   conclusions of the study were in accordance with the geohydrology of the
   area as existed at that time.  The theoretical formulation was
   originally not in closed form, but it is shown to be equivalent to a
   recent analytical solution.}},

Abstract = {{Monthly runoff sequences from catchments in southeastern Botswana were

   monthly runoff sequences.  The stochastic component behaved as an
   autoregressive process of order 3, i.e. AR(3) for all the stations and
   was found to be greatly dominated by first-order persistence trends with
   the first-order autoregressive parameters ranging from 0.54 to 0.96. The
   contribution of higher-order persistence terms, by contrast, was found
   to be fairly uniform for all the stations.  Total monthly runoff
   sequences, on the other hand, behaved as an integrated moving average
   process (IMA(0,1,2)) for all the stations.  This model performed
   satisfactorily for forecasting total monthly flows for up to 12 months

Abstract = {{A cascade-based model is used to predict the dissolved chemical
   concentration profile at the effluent of a field.  The source of
   chemicals is the soil surface layer, from which the chemicals are
   transferred to the surface runoff and transported to the field outlet. 
   The model applies a cascade of perfectly mixed cells analogous to an
   equivalent surface runoff water and soil surface layer.  Each cell is
   made of two interconnected units, where the upper unit represents the
   runoff water and the lower unit represents the soil bulk.  Chemical
   transfer between the two units is controlled by the convective
   mass-transfer process through the laminar boundary layer of the surface
   runoff flow.  The cells are interconnected through their upper units by
   runoff water flow.  The lower unit applies a perfectly mixed reactor
   analog to an equivalent and homogeneous soil layer of uniform
   concentration near the soil surface, called the effective depth of
   transfer (EDT).  The expression for the concentration within the EDT is
   simplified and agrees well with the soil surface concentration as
   determined by an analytical solution of the one-dimensional diffusion
   equation for the limiting case of no infiltration.  The number of cells
   in the cascade is a measure of the extent of axial mixing in runoff flow
   where the limiting cases are:  (1) a perfectly mixed system represented
   by one cell, and (2) a zero-mixing system (plug flow) represented by a
   cascade made of an infinite number of cells.  The distribution of
   chemical concentrations for these two extreme cases and for other flows
   with varying degrees of mixing are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Ground waters from the confined Lower Cretaceous-Jurassic aquifer of the
   Great Artesian Basin, Australia (GAB) are characterised by Na-HCO3 type
   waters throughout the eastern and central parts of the basin and
   Na-SO4-Cl type waters in the western part.  Sodium and bicarbonate
   increase in concentration from the northeastern margins to the
   southwestern discharge areas along the regional groundwater flowlines. 
   A mass-balance and equilibrium model for major dissolved species and
   stable carbon isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon show that the
   chemical trends observed are caused by mass transfer reactions involving
   cation exchange of Na for Ca-Mg, carbonate dissolution and reactions
   between Na and kaolinite to form Na-smectite.  The stable carbon
   isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) increases from
   values of about -15 parts per thousand near the basin margins to -6
   parts per thousand in the interior of the basin.  An inverse
   relationship exists between delta-C-13 and DIC indicating addition of
   enriched carbon as the ground waters move basinwards.  A C-12-C-13 mass
   balance indicates that the trend toward heavier delta-C-13 values in the
   interior of the basin results from bacterial reduction of carbon dioxide
   to produce methane rather than dissolution of, and equilibration with,
   carbonate minerals.  The GAB aquifer system is apparently open to CO2
   which is the product of in situ anaerobic fermentation producing CO2
   enriched in C-13.
   The chemical evolution of the major dissolved species and carbon isotope
   distribution in the eastern and central parts of the GAB can then be
   envisaged as an initial pCO2 up to several orders of magnitude above
   atmospheric level is acquired within the recharge area by plant
   respiration and oxidation of organic matter in the soil zone. 
   Initially, silicate and carbonate minerals may dissolve, at least in
   some parts of the basin, resulting in increased alkalinity, higher Ca
   and Mg concentrations, and a delta-C-13 concentration of the DIC of
   around -12 parts per thousand.  Processes such as cation exchange of Na
   for Ca and Mg in addition to the removal of some Na by `reverse
   weathering' which produces a Na smectite dominate in the interior of the
   GAB.  The chemistry of ground waters derived from the western recharge
   areas is controlled by evaporite dissolution as indicated by very high
   Cl/Br ratios.}},

   within the overlying till control the recharge rate, major-ion chemistry
   and isotopic composition of the water in the aquifer. The bedrock is
   hydraulically isolated from the system and does not affect the
   groundwater chemistry. Reaction products generated in the till are fed
   into the aquifer by advection and diffusion. The aquifer acts as a
   chemically inert lateral transmission and mixing zone. Hydrochemical
   patterns in the aquifer are regional in extent and appear to be related
   to the geochemical conditions within the till and the flow pattern in
   the aquifer. The system is evolving geochemically on a time scale of

Abstract = {{Changes in groundwater flow were observed near four Experimental Wetland
   Areas (EWAs) constructed along a reach of the Des Plaines River in
   northeastern Illinois.  These changes were observed during monthly
   monitoring of groundwater elevation in nested piezometers and shallow
   observation wells before and after the wetlands were filled with water. 
   A numerical model was calibrated with observed data and used to estimate
   seepage from the wetlands into the Des Plaines River.
   After the wetlands became operational, groundwater levels in adjacent
   wells increased by about 0.5 m, while water levels in wells distant from
   the wetlands decreased.  The increase in groundwater levels near the
   wetlands is a result of seepage from the wetlands.  Numerical
   predictions of seepage from the wetlands are 60-150 m3 day-1 for two
   wetlands situated over sand and gravel and less than 1 m3 day-1 for two
   wetlands situated over clayey till.  The difference in seepage rates is
   attributed to two factors.  First, the hydraulic conductivity of the
   sand and gravel unit is greater than that of the till, and thus there is
   less mounding and a greater capacity for transmitting water beneath the
   wetlands overlying this deposit.  Secondly, the wetlands located over
   till are groundwater flow-through ponds, whereas the wetlands over the
   sand and gravel are primarily groundwater recharge areas.
   The model was used to estimate that seepage from the wetlands will
   double groundwater discharge into the Des Plaines River and a tributary
   relative to pre-operational discharge from the study area.  Overall, the
   wetlands have acted as a constant head boundary, stabilizing groundwater
   flow patterns.}},

Abstract = {{At the Finnsjon site, central Sweden, a 100-m-wide, low-angle fracture
   zone in granodiorite, Zone 2, has been studied by means of borehole
   investigations.  This has included core and geophysical logging as well
   as hydraulic tests and groundwater sampling.  Zone 2 was developed at
   1.7-1.6 Ga as a ductile shear zone at a depth of approximately 10-15 km
   and repeated reactivation has occurred during Precambrian time and
   later.  Today, the upper boundary of the zone is defined in nine
   boreholes at depths ranging from 100 to 295 m.  Pumping tests have
   demonstrated that the upper part of the zone is highly water conductive
   with a transmissivity in excess of 10(-3) m2 s-1.  From tracer tests the
   equivalent single fracture hydraulic conductivity was calculated to be
   0.03-0.2 m s-1.  This extremely high transmissivity and conductivity
   over such a large areal extent can be speculated to be the result of
   recent opening of Zone 2 during the last inland ice period.
   In situ measurements of the natural groundwater flow show that the flow
   is high (67-90 m3 m-2 year-1) at the upper boundary of Zone 2, whereas
   near-stagnant conditions occur at the lower boundary, and in the relict
   saline water beneath the zone.  Isotope data suggest a complex origin
   for the saline water.  The hydraulic head measurements as well as the
   groundwater chemistry strongly suggest that the low-angle Zone 2 acts as
   a hydraulic barrier preventing ground water from percolating downward
   through the zone.
   These studies have helped to focus on repository safety assessment
   problems which hitherto had been oversimplified for the benefit of
   performance models.  Furthermore, the results have shown that these
   low-angle large-scale fracture zones are likely to be even more
   important controls than steep zones, when considering bedrock stability,
   rock stress regimes, and lateral groundwater flow patterns. 
   Quantification of such phenomena should provide an invaluable input into
   the various safety assessment performance codes for model validation and
   siting criteria for a repository.}},

Abstract = {{In 1984 the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB)
   initiated detailed investigations involving the geological, geophysical,
   hydrological and geochemical character of a fracture zone.  For this
   purpose, a low-angle SSW-dipping fracture zone in a foliated
   granodiorite of Svecokarelian age (approximately 1.8 Ga), within the
   sub-Cambrian peneplain of northeastern Uppland, central eastern Sweden,
   was identified and investigated by extensive drilling.  The initial
   formation of this zone, which is estimated to have taken place
   approximately 1.7 Ga ago as a result of ductile deformation, was
   followed by shearing during ductile-brittle transitional conditions, and
   subsequently by brittle deformation.  It formed as a thrust in a 20-30
   km WNW-ESE-trending strike-slip fault zone.  The fracture zone is
   approximately 100 m wide with an anastomosing shear pattern and is
   displaced by subvertical faults.  Late reactivation of the zone has
   occurred preferentially in the upper part which is now open, permitting
   water transport.
   The palaeo-flow paths, indicated by bedrock alteration and fracture
   infillings, show that the hydraulic flow system in the rock mass has
   become increasingly restricted during geologic time.  Flow now occurs
   predominantly along discrete zones which were initiated more than 1.7 Ga
   ago and since then have been repeatedly reactivated.  The most intense
   penetrative fracturing, associated with hydrothermal activity, occurred
   more than 1.0 Ga ago.
   Fractures and fracture zones most likely to conduct water, i.e. forming
   transport pathways between a repository and the biosphere, tend to be
   those with a long and complex tectonic history.}},

Abstract = {{The hydraulic characteristics of a gently dipping fracture zone in
   crystalline rock at the Finnsjon test site in Sweden are described.  The
   information is derived from single-hole injection tests of different
   packer spacings, including very detailed tests in 0.11-m sections in a
   few borehole segments.  In addition, detailed hydraulic interference
   tests were performed by pumping in different parts of the zone and
   monitoring pressure changes in multiple-section observation boreholes.
   The results of the hydraulic testing show that the fracture zone is
   composed of two to five thin, highly conductive subzones in the
   boreholes; the uppermost subzone is consistently located close to the
   upper boundary of the major zone and can be correlated over several
   hundreds of metres.
   There is evidence of both lateral and vertical hydraulic anisotropy
   along the zone.  The interference tests show that the fracture zone is
   delimited by semi-permeable boundaries, probably constituted by steeply
   dipping fracture zones.  The results of the hydraulic testing are used
   to simulate the pressure responses obtained in the observation boreholes
   by numerical modelling.}},

Abstract = {{The performance and results of a series of hydraulic head measurements
   and differently designed tracer tests are described.  A combined
   interpretation of the results is utilized to estimate the natural
   groundwater flow conditions in a low-angle major fracture zone (Zone 2)
   investigated at the Finnsjon study site, central eastern Sweden.
   The transport of tracer-labelled flushing water used during drilling of
   a cored borehole was utilized to determine hydraulic connections and
   estimations of hydraulic parameters.  The breakthrough of tracer was
   monitored at a distance of 440 m from the injection point with a mean
   residence time of 37 days.  In order to determine transport parameters
   of the fracture zone, a tracer test was performed in conjunction with an
   interference test.  The hydraulic fracture conductivity, flow porosity,
   equivalent fracture width and dispersivity were calculated for three
   different tracer routes.  Tracer was also used to detect any bypass
   around the packers during the interference test.  A series of
   groundwater flow determinations are also described, which used the point
   dilution technique is packed-off borehole sections, carried out under
   natural gradient conditions.
   The groundwater head measurements indicated that a pressure gradient
   from high to low exists between the adjacent rocks and Zone 2; where
   Zone 2 is located closer to the ground surface, the opposite situation
   prevails.  The upper highly conductive part of the zone was found to
   have high natural flow rates, whereas in the lower highly conductive
   part, the groundwater flow rates were very low, close to the rate of
   molecular diffusion.}},

Abstract = {{The recorded volumes of flushing water used during the drilling of cored
   boreholes, and the amounts recovered at the surface, have been used to
   estimate the potential quantities of flushing water and drilling debris
   injected into fractures.
   The results show that significant amounts of flushing water and drilling
   debris may be injected into fractures during drilling.  For cored
   boreholes penetrating major fracture zones, only about 7-8\% of the
   total volume of flushing water used was recovered at the surface.  A
   total loss of flushing water occurred in all boreholes during
   penetration of these fracture zones.  The recovered amounts of drilling
   debris were also low.
   Higher percentages of drilling debris were recovered from the air-flush
   percussion boreholes but, on the other hand, larger total amounts of
   debris were lost to the rock.
   During gas-lift pumping in borehole KF110, only very small estimated
   amounts of the flushing water (3-4\%) and drilling debris (approximately
   1\%) lost to the rock were recovered.  The gas-lift pumping was also
   shown to have a minor influence on the borehole hydraulic parameters
   calculated from hydraulic tests before and after pumping.}},

Abstract = {{Ground water collected from within and around a highly conductive
   low-angle fracture zone in crystaline rock has been studied in relation
   to drilling and sampling methods, water quality and hydrogeochemical
   interpretation.
   Air-flush percussion drilling was demonstrated to be efficient down to
   200-250 m; at greater depths, large amounts of drilling debris and
   increasing groundwater contamination from air dissolution become
   apparent.  A stepwise drilling/sampling procedure using water-flush
   rotary drilling, in combination with water analysis carried out on site
   using a mobile laboratory, is recommended for future studies.
   The chemistry of the Finnsjon ground waters shows a sharp contact
   between saline and non-saline compositions, this contact corresponding
   to a highly conductive low-angle fracture zone (Zone 2).  This zone is
   therefore a horizon along which ground waters of contrasting age and
   chemistry come into contact and partially mix.  This mixing has produced
   a highly supersaturated water resulting in the precipitation of calcite.
   This is most evident in fractures within the more conductive, upper part
   of Zone 2, thus partly forming a seal between the two groundwater
   environments.
   Comparison of the Finnsjon saline waters with other saline environments,
   particularly in the Fennoscandian Shield, has shown that the ground
   waters are dominantly marine in origin, but with clear modifications
   resulting from water/rock interaction.  Apparent radiocarbon ages range
   from 9000 to 15 000 years in those waters containing tritum levels below
   detection limits.  These ages are considered too young and are thought
   to have resulted from mainly carbon-14 dilution caused by groundwater
   mixing during the Holocene, when large quantities of glacial melt water
   were available.  This mixing process is also supported by the oxygen-18
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Short-term stream chemistry response in a small stream in upland Wales
   is characterised by applying a mixing approach whereby the flow is
   assumed to be a mix of water from two distinct sources.  Acidic water
   from the upper soil horizons and well buffered water from deeper
   groundwater sources are used to represent the two endmembers and a
   chemical hydrograph separation technique is used to estimate the mean
   proportions of mix.  A long-term simulation model, the Model of
   Acidification of Groundwater In Catchments {[}MAGIC] is calibrated in
   its two-layer mode to these two endmember chemistries.  The model
   produces a good fit to observed present-day stream, soil and baseflow
   chemistry.  Future predictions of changes in endmember chemistry are
   made so as to enable future episodic response to be modelled.  Under a
   60\% sulphate deposition scenario, the model predicts a lowering of
   hydrogen ion concentrations associated with high flows and even a
   marginal recovery in baseflow pH.}},

Abstract = {{Hourly data from a network of 100 autographic raingauges have been
   collected as part of an extensive hydrological investigation of five
   wadis in southwest Saudi Arabia.  The general spatial and temporal
   characteristics of these data are presented.  Seasonality of catchment
   rainday occurrence is illustrated and gauge rainday occurrence shown to
   be strongly associated with elevation.  Most point rainfalls are of 1-2
   h duration, initiated in mid to late afternoon.  Spatial distribution is
   highly localised so that for the minimum intergauge distances of 8-20
   km, probability of joint occurrence and cross-correlation of hourly
   rainfall are small.  On the basis of these data, a stochastic model of
   the spatial distribution of hourly rainfall has been formulated. 
   Catchment and gauge rainday occurrence are well reproduced, as are point
   rainfall depths and durations.  Spatial performance is reasonable for
   daily rainfall.  However, the weak spatial dependence in the data leads
   to some clustering of occurrence at the hourly level, which the model is
   unable to reproduce.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in regional temperature and precipitation expected to occur as a
   result of the accumulation of greenhouse gases may have significant
   impacts on water resources.  We use a conceptual hydrologic model,
   developed and operated by the National Weather Service, to study the
   sensitivity of surface runoff in several sub-basins of the Colorado
   River to these changes.  Increases in temperature of 2-degrees-C
   decrease mean annual runoff by 4-12\%.  A temperature increase of
   4-degrees-C decreases mean annual runoff by 9-21\%.  Increases or
   decreases in annual precipitation of 10-20\% result in corresponding
   changes in mean annual runoff of approximately 10-20\%.  For the range
   of scenarios studied, these results suggest that runoff in the basin is
   somewhat more sensitive to changes in precipitation than to changes in
   temperature.  Seasonal changes were also observed, with peak runoff
   shifting from June to April or May.  Fall and winter flows generally
   increase, whereas spring and summer flows decrease in most of the
   scenarios studied.  These changes are attributed to an increase of the
   ratio of rain to snow and to a higher snowline.  Although these results
   suggest that streamflow in the Colorado Basin is less sensitive to
   climatic changes than previous statistical studies have indicated, the
   magnitude of possible changes is nonetheless sufficiently great to have
   significant environmental, economic, and political implications.}},

Abstract = {{Precipitation was collected in southern Nevada on a semi-regular monthly
   basis at 14 locations for 6 years for stable isotopic analysis.  The
   total elevational range of the collection sites was 1270 m and the total
   geographic range was 65 km.  The average yearly difference in delta-O-18
   of precipitation from all sites was smallest and amounted to only 2.3
   parts-per-thousand, whereas the average difference based on location
   (elevation) was only 3.7 parts-per-thousand.  The largest difference in
   delta-O-18 was between enriched summer and depleted winter precipitation
   and amounted to more than 13 parts-per-thousand.
   The precipitation record shows two time-based regimes.  For the first 3
   years of collection, the precipitation was highly variable with several
   large events and several dry periods.  During the last 3 years of
   collection, the precipitation was much more even with no large events. 
   However, there is no correlation between the variability of the amount
   of precipitation and the stable isotopic composition of precipitation.
   In addition, the delta-O-18 composition and discharge of two springs,
   Whiterock Spring and Cane Spring, issuing from perched water tables,
   were monitored for 5 years on a similar basis as for the precipitation. 
   During the first 2.5 years of collection, both volume of discharge and
   delta-O-18 responded to large precipitation events.  However, during the
   last 2.5 years of collection when precipitation moderated in amounts,
   but not in stable isotopic composition, the springs displayed not only
   less variation in discharge, but in stable isotopic composition as well.
   Summer precipitation may be involved in groundwater recharge, as during
   the first 3 years of collection, some of the events to which the springs
   responded were summer events.  Moreover, the average delta-O-18 of
   winter precipitation is less than that of the spring discharge, even
   when the water from large summer events is absent from the spring
   discharge.}},

Abstract = {{Streamflow record augmentation procedures exploit the cross-correlation
   among streamflows at two or more streamgages to obtain improved
   estimates of the mean and variance of the flows at a short-record gage. 
   Recent improvements in these procedures provide unbiased estimates of
   the mean and variance of the flows at the short-record site which always
   have equal or lower variance than simple at-site sample estimates. 
   Essentially, record augmentation procedures increase the effective
   record length at a short-record site in proportion to the additional
   length of the nearby longer record and the cross-correlation of the
   concurrent streamflows at the two sites.  An experiment documents the
   effective increase in record lengths on a site-by-site basis and on a
   regional basis using a network of 23 streamgages in or near
   Massachusetts.  The increases in effective record lengths owing to the
   use of streamflow record augmentation procedures are substantial for the
   very-short-record sites for both flood-flow and low-flow statistics. 
   However, the serial correlation associated with both flood-flow and
   low-flow sequences reduces those gains considerably.}},

Abstract = {{The reliability of water supply from a single pumped storage reservoir

   source river is studied.
   Methods are presented to estimate actual monthly pumped flows, given a
   set of constraints imposed by the daily fluctuations in the source flow.
   It is found that a parameter called the `fitting parameter' plays the
   most important role in the identification of the minimum monthly source
   flow necessary in the source for a maximum pumped flow to occur. 
   Further, the low-flow exceedance probabilities are obtained by direct
   integration of the joint probability density function of monthly natural
   and pumped flows:  this takes account of the effect of correlation of
   the two inflows, which have different characteristics.  The results are
   compared with a previous study.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrostratigraphic data define a subhorizontal, laterally limited,
   highly permeable zone of intensely fractured siltstone (major fracture
   zone) within the relatively impermeable Brule Formation at a site in
   Cheyenne County, Nebraska.  Two types of transient hydraulic responses
   were noted in 11 observation wells during an eight-day aquifer test: 
   Type 1 responses occurred in wells which intercepted the major fracture
   zone; Type 2 responses occurred in wells outside the major fracture
   zone.
   Transient responses in Type 1 observation wells are matched with type
   curves for a three-layered system with a water-table aquitard above an
   aquifer (major fracture zone) which overlies an elastic aquitard. 
   Because the aquifer is laterally limited and the Brule Formation beyond
   the major fracture zone has finite hydraulic conductivity, real
   late-time behavior falls between type curves for an infinite aquifer and
   for an aquifer with an impermeable boundary at reasonable distances from
   the pumping well.  Aquifer and aquitard parameters determined from curve
   matches with both limiting boundary conditions are identical for
   inner-ring observation wells, and nearly so for middle-ring observation
   wells.  Outer-ring observation wells exhibited Type 2 responses which
   were used only to identify the extent of the major fracture zone.}},

Abstract = {{Climatic changes that result from increasing concentrations of
   atmospheric carbon dioxide may affect the availability of water for
   vegetation, groundwater recharge, runoff, and human consumption.  Most
   studies of the effects of climatic change on water resources focus on
   changes in mean characteristics of hydrologic variables and do not
   consider the effects of these changes amid natural climatic variability.
   In this study, the Thornthwaite moisture index, an index of the supply
   of water in an area (precipitation) relative to the climatic demand for
   water (potential evapotranspiration), was used to examine the effects of
   a hypothetical increase in air temperature on moisture conditions in the
   United States.  The effects of a gradual increase in air temperature at
   the rate of 4-degrees-C per 100 years, with no accompanying change in
   precipitation, was used to induce a change in Thornthwaite moisture
   index values for the United States in order to:  (i) determine the
   relation between natural variability in climate and the time needed for
   significant trends in the moisture index to occur in response to
   hypothetical warming; (ii) identify the characteristics of areas (e.g.
   wet/cool, hot/dry etc.) that are most likely to be the first to
   experience significant changes in the moisture index given the
   hypothetical temperature increase.
   The increased temperature resulted in increased potential
   evapotranspiration and a decrease in the moisture index across the
   United States.  Decreases in the moisture index were greatest in
   cool/wet regions and least in hot/dry regions.  The time required to
   detect significant trends in the moisture index was a function of both
   the magnitude of change in the moisture index and the natural
   year-to-year variability of the moisture index.  In general, when the
   ratio of the magnitude of change in the moisture index to the magnitude
   of variability was large, the time required to detect significant trends
   was short.  This ratio was largest in cool/wet regions resulting in the
   shortest detection times.}},

Abstract = {{Harmonic analysis of the cumulative departures of annual flow series
   from their sample mean values have been performed in detail.  The main
   purpose was to obtain a mathematical model of the cumulative departures
   that would preserve the Hurst phenomenon.  As a result of the analysis
   it has been observed that in the cumulative departures there exist
   strong periodicities with the slowest cycles having periods equal to the
   total sample length.  The cyclic features account for more than 95\% of
   the variability in the Hurst coefficients.  An alternative to direct
   simulation of annual sequences for preserving the Hurst phenomenon is
   suggested in this paper.  First the cumulative departures should be
   simulated and then the annual flow series should be obtained by
   successive differencing of the generated cumulative departures.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term safety of nuclear waste disposal in a deep geological
   repository depends essentially on the capacity of artificial and natural
   barriers to slow down the possible return of long-lived radionuclides to
   the biosphere.  Mathematical models applied to various geological
   formations have been developed for describing the time and space
   evolution of the radioactivity released by the waste packages.  Such a
   study was carried out in Sweden in the case of a spent-fuel disposal in
   granitic bedrock.  The basic problem is that of the transport of
   dissolved radioactive substances by the ground water flowing slowly
   along fractures in the rock.  Retention of the radionuclides by sorption
   on the fracture walls and matrix diffusion is found to reduce
   drastically the nuclide migration; the conclusion is that the
   radiological impact of the repository should be negligible at any time
   in the future.  One of the essential points in these calculations is
   that the nuclides are transported for the major part in an aqueous
   solution.
   We consider here the hypothetical case where a significant part of the
   nuclides would be transported by stable aggregates or colloids, small
   enough to follow the groundwater flow.  It is clear that the nuclide
   transport might be much faster in such conditions than in the case of a
   simple aqueous solution.  The model represents jointly the transport of
   the two phases, the solute phase and the colloidal one, in a fissure
   with constant aperture; the colloids are supposed to dissolve
   immediately when the concentration of the solute drops below the
   solubility limit through sorption of the fracture walls and diffusion
   into the matrix.  In two typical cases (linear sorption of the colloids
   or strong sorption with maximum exchange capacity), analytical solutions
   may be obtained for the transport of the nuclides along the fissure, at
   the cost of approximations whose validity is briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The beach-ridge strandplain at Ocean Bight, Great Exuma, partially fills
   a large embayment bordered by the Lucayan Formation (Pleistocene
   limestone), the bedrock of Great Exuma Island.  Seismic refraction
   profiles indicate that the Holocene sand body rests in an
   amphitheater-like bedrock bowl beneath the strandplain.  Direct current
   resistivity and electromagnetic surveys show that the lens extends
   downward into the Lucayan bedrock below much of the strandplain.  The
   lens is thickest along the central, shore-parallel axis of the
   strandplain; therefore, flow is not only shoreward but also inland.  The
   reason for the inland groundwater flow is a large net water loss (- 0.5
   m year-1 according to earlier studies) at inland ponds near the
   Holocene/Pleistocene contact bounding the strandplain. 
   Dupuit-Ghyben-Herzberg (DGH) modeling using negative recharge at the
   ponds confirms the explanation for the landward flow and the corollary
   isolation of the Ocean Bight lens.  For the purpose of DGH modeling, the
   aquifer at the Ocean Bight strandplain can be considered a two-layer
   (Holocene on Pleistocene) island that conforms to the outline of the
   strandplain.  The buried high-conductivity layer (the Lucayan) reduces
   the thickness of the lens.}},

Abstract = {{The Loch Fleet catchment lies in an upland region in the centre of the
   outcrop of the Cairnsmore of Fleet granite.  It is a recently acidified
   lake (pH = 4.4) which has been the subject of a liming experiment to
   restore fisheries.  In the present study, hydrogeological and
   geochemical techniques were used to determine the contribution of ground
   water to the loch and its role in buffering the lake water chemistry.
   Diffuse groundwater seepage was detected by infrared linescan survey,
   and overflowing ground water (2 m above the level of the loch) was
   encountered in a shallow borehole.  This ground water has an alkaline
   geochemistry (pH = 7.2, HCO3- = 142 mg l-1) determined by secondary vein
   calcite and hydrolysis of silicate minerals.  The net gains or losses of
   various constituents in the ground water and in the loch outflow have
   been determined relative to rainfall inputs.  Na, K, Ca, Mg, HCO3, SO4,
   Cl, Si, Sr, Fe, Mn, Li and F all show net gain in the ground water; NO3,
   Al, Zn and B show a net loss.  In the acidic loch outflow, Ca, Mg, Si,
   Sr, Ba, Fe, Mn, Al, Zn and Li show a net gain over rainfall inputs; most
   of these elements derive from ground water, enhanced by
   evapotranspiration by a factor of 1.8.
   The chemical results have been used to determine that ground water
   contributes around 3.5 l s-1 to the loch, compared with an estimated 3-4
   l s-1 derived from hydrograph analysis.  This constitutes 5\% of the
   mean loch outflow, which was sufficient to buffer the loch at around pH
   = 6.0 until the late 1960s.  Titrations of ground water with loch water
   show that as little as 0.06 l s-1 (1656 m3 year-1) of additional ground
   water would be required to restore the loch to conditions suitable for a
   self-sustaining fish population.  Twice this flux (3310 m3 year-1) would
   restore the loch to the conditions pertaining in the pre-industrial era.
   These targets could be achieved at an economic cost, it is suggested, by
   induced abstraction of ground water in the upper reaches of the
   catchment without any harmful ecological effect.}},

Abstract = {{The application of two methods of analysis to the movement of a tracer
   through trees, involving `total counts' or convection-dispersion models,
   is discussed, particularly in relation to fluctuating flows.
   A rigorous definition of the `measured' flow rate obtained with the
   total counts method is developed. It is shown, from the principle of
   conservation of mass, that the total counts method provides an estimate
   of the weighted mean flow over the time period that the tracer is
   present at the sampling point. The weighting factor is the relative
   concentration of the tracer as measured at the sampling point.
   Using results from a tracing experiment on Eucalyptus teretecornis it is
   shown that the system parameters, diffusivity, porosity and convective
   flow velocity, are such that the time scale of the weighted mean
   flow-rate determination is a period of the order of 2 to 3 days. It is
   also shown that diurnal fluctuations in flow do not introduce
   significant errors in the estimate of the weighted mean flow estimate.
   Application of the convection-dispersion model allows these system
   parameters to be calculated.
   Although the implications of the use of these methods are discussed in
   relation to the flow of tracer through tree stems, they are equally
   valid in any situation in which the `total counts' method is used.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis is explored that groundwater-level rises in the Great
   Bend Prairie aquifer of Kansas are caused not only by water percolating
   downward through the soil but also by pressure pulses from stream
   flooding that propagate in a translatory motion through numerous high
   hydraulic diffusivity buried channels crossing the Great Bend Prairie
   aquifer in an approximately west to east direction.  To validate this
   hypothesis, two transects of wells in a north-south and east-west
   orientation crossing and alongside some paleochannels in the area were
   instrumented with water-level-recording devices; streamflow data from
   all area streams were obtained from available stream-gaging stations.  A
   theoretical approach was also developed to conceptualize numerically the
   stream-aquifer processes.  The field data and numerical simulations
   provided support for the hypothesis.  Thus, observation wells located
   along the shoulders or in between the inferred paleochannels show little
   or no fluctuations and no correlations with streamflow, whereas wells
   located along paleochannels show high water-level fluctuations and good
   correlation with the streamflows of the stream connected to the
   observation site by means of the paleochannels.  The stream-aquifer
   numerical simulation results demonstrate that the larger the hydraulic
   diffusivity of the aquifer, the larger the extent of pressure pulse
   propagation and the faster the propagation speed.  The conceptual
   simulation results indicate that long-distance propagation of stream
   floodwaves (of the order of tens of kilometers) through the Great Bend
   aquifer is indeed feasible with plausible stream and aquifer parameters.
   The sensitivity analysis results indicate that the extent and speed of
   pulse propagation is more sensitive to variations of stream roughness
   (Manning's coefficient) and stream channel slope than to any aquifer
   parameter.}},

Abstract = {{A relatively simple and practical approach for calculating groundwater
   recharge in semiarid plain environments with a relatively shallow water
   table, such as the Kansas Prairies, is outlined.  Major uncertainties in
   the Darcian, water balance, and groundwater fluctuation analysis
   approaches are outlined, and a combination methodology for reducing some
   of the uncertainties is proposed.  By combining a storm-based soilwater
   balance (lasting several days) with the resulting water table rise,
   effective storativity values of the region near the water table are
   obtained.  This combination method is termed the `hybrid
   water-fluctuation method'.  Using a simple average of several such
   estimates results in a site-calibrated effective storativity value that
   can be used to translate each major water-table rise tied to a specific
   storm period into a corresponding amount of groundwater recharge. 
   Examples of soilwater balance and water-level fluctuation analyses based
   on field-measured data from Kansas show that the proposed methodology
   gives better and more reliable results than either of the two
   well-established approaches used singly.}},

   hillslope within a moorland catchment.  In terms of the long-term
   behaviour of stream chemistry, in particular calcium, pH and aluminium,
   at each site, addition of limestone to hydrological source areas has
   raised stream chemistry above proposed biological thresholds in the long

Abstract = {{Sediment profiles of a shallow sandy aquifer in an agricultural area of

   oxidation-reduction front; in this study the front was a zone
   approximately 30 cm wide.  Oxygen, nitrate and sulfate were present
   above the oxidation-reduction front but disappeared at the front. 
   Detailed porewater profiles indicate that denitrification also takes
   place above the front, supposedly in anaerobic microenvironments not
   evident in the water samples from the small wells.  The TRC profiles
   showed that some reduction capacity is still present above the
   oxidation-reduction front and is apparently able to support

Abstract = {{A new method to measure Rn-222 concentration in water is described. 
   This method is an application of the activated charcoal passive
   collector method, which is sometimes used for measurement of Rn-222
   concentration in air.  The model and the equation which express the
   quantity of Rn-222 adsorbed in activated charcoal in the collector were
   constructed, inspected experimentally, and proved to work well enough
   for the measurement of relative concentration of Rn-222 in water.
   We used this method to measure the Rn-222 concentration in water at
   approximately 20 points in an actual river.  Based on the fact that the
   concentration of Rn-222 in groun generally much higher than that of
   surface water, we found several possible groundwater seepage points
   along the river.  For the absolute measurement of Rn-222 concentration
   in water by this method, it would also be necessary to investigate the
   effect of temperature on the quantity of Rn-222 collected in a
   collector.}},

Abstract = {{Suspended-sediment and dissolved-solid (salt) loads decreased after the
   early 1940s in the Colorado Plateau portion of the Colorado River basin,
   although discharge of major rivers - the Colorado, Green and San Juan -
   did not change significantly. This decline followed a period of high
   sediment yield caused by arroyo cutting. Reduced sediment loads have
   previously been explained by a change in sediment sampling procedures or
   changes in climate, land-use and conservation practices. More recent
   work has revealed that both decreased sediment production and sediment
   storage in channels of tributary basins produced the decline of sediment
   and salt loads. Sediment production and sediment storage are important
   components of incised-channel evolution, which involves sequential
   channel deepening, widening and finally floodplain formation.
   Accordingly, the widespread arroyo incision of the late nineteenth
   century resulted initially in high sediment loads. Since then, loads
   have decreased as incised channels (arroyos) have stabilized and begun
   to aggrade. However, during the 1940s, a period of low peak discharges
   permitted vegetational colonization of the valley floors, which further
   reduced sediment loads and promoted channel stabilization. This
   explanation is supported by experimental studies and field observations.
   Both geomorphic and hydrologic factors contributed to sediment storage
   and decreased sediment and salt loads in the upper Colorado River basin.}},

Abstract = {{The first part of this paper presents exact probability distribution
   functions (PDF) of upcrossings in stationary first-order Markov
   processes for finite sample lengths.  In the derivation of these PDF,
   the enumeration technique is used and the correctness of the results
   obtained is checked with the total probability of all the possible
   upcrossings, which has to equal unity for any sample length.  Numerical
   calculations of these PDF on digital computers led to the condition that
   the expected number of crossings is linearly proportional to the
   truncation level probability.  Hence, the proportionality factor is a
   function of the first-order autorun coefficient, which is intimately
   related to the first-order autocorrelation coefficient.  The PDF are
   valid for stationary and dependent processes irrespective of their
   underlying probability distribution functions.
   In the second part of the paper, various analytical expressions
   concerning run properties, such as the mean positive and negative run
   lengths, run sums, and number of crossings, are presented.  Their
   applications to a set of serially dependent annual flow sequences are
   performed.  Good agreements are obtained between the derived expressions
   for calculating run properties and their counterparts from observed
   sequences.}},

Abstract = {{The River Murray discharges only 4\% of annual precipitation delivered
   to the Murray Basin.  Flow gauging and water composition data over an 18
   year period (1971-1989) indicate that median annual transport of
   chloride out of the basin was 2.6-4.1 times that delivered annually by
   the atmosphere to surface runoff plus inflow from the tributary Darling
   River.  The additional salt flux out of the River Murray was apparently
   derived primarily from saline ground water plus mobilization by
   irrigation drainage of salt stored within the unsaturated zone.  During
   March 1989, towards the end of a dry summer, the deuterium composition
   of water near the river mouth was delta-D = -4 parts per thousand,
   compared with delta-D = -43 parts per thousand in the largest headwater
   catchment.  Most of this heavy isotope enrichment was the result of
   evaporation from reservoir and river surfaces plus inflow of irrigation
   drainage water.  The trend in deuterium values along the river axis
   suggests that a large component of the chloride increase in the middle
   third of the river was derived from irrigation drainage whereas the
   further increase of chloride in the downstream third of the Murray was
   derived primarily from influx of saline ground waters.  Evaporative
   enrichment appears to play a major role in the seasonal and geographical
   trends of stable isotope composition in the River Murray.  The total
   deuterium enrichment observed indicates that integrated evaporation
   losses in the basin are similar in magnitude to transpiration losses
   during the months of intensive irrigation.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of clearing and subsequent crop and pasture growth on
   recharge to ground waters was investigated in three experimental
   catchments in the brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) lands of north-eastern
   Australia.  Recharge was calculated from soil chloride data, using a
   simple transient solute mass balance model.
   Clearing had a substantial initial effect on groundwater recharge, with
   average recharge rates of 29 to 70 mm year-1 in two cleared catchments,
   compared with 7 mm year-1 in an uncleared catchment.  These results were
   attributed to record high rains that fell while both cleared catchments
   were bare of vegetation, before crops or pastures were established.  The
   effect was only short lived, however, with no significant recharge
   occurring in any of the three catchments during the period in which
   crops and pastures were fully established.  This lack of recharge was
   contrary to the general belief that clearing and establishment of crops
   or pastures causes a sustained increase in groundwater recharge.  The
   low recharge rates at this site were attributed to the slowly permeable
   soils and the climate of the study site, where potential evaporation
   exceeds average rainfall in all months, and to the water use
   characteristic of brigalow.  Brigalow is shallow-rooted, and at this
   site generated lower soil water deficits than either crops or pastures. 
   Clearing is unlikely to result in high water-tables in these soils under
   pastures or opportunity cropping systems under the average climatic
   conditions of the region.
   The simple transient solute mass balance model used to estimate recharge
   rates gave important and significant differences in recharge when
   compared with a more commonly used steady-state model.  All recharge
   rates calculated with the steady-state model were less-than-or-equal-to
   1.8 mm year-1 (most < 0.3 mm year-1), and so this model could not
   identify the gross short-term recharge response to clearing at this
   site.}},

   The model was tested for stability and parameter sensitivity and then
   used to generate typical circulation patterns for a variety of

Abstract = {{A 3m wide by 9m long by 1m deep soil block on a forested hillslope near
   Orono, ME, was isolated by excavation of encircling trenches.  A
   sprinkler system for application of water and potassium bromide tracer
   was constructed over the plot.  Outflow was collected at six locations
   with troughs.  Experiments were conducted at application rates of 2.5,
   5, and 10 cm h-1.  Pulses of tracer were applied subsequent to
   attainment of steady flow and breakthrough curves were measured at all
   outflow points.  Recession limbs of outflow hydrographs exhibited
   distinct breaks when plotted on semilogarithmic axes, indicating
   drainage from at least two distinguishable pore size classes or flow
   pathways.  Solute breakthrough curves were dominated by a single peak;
   travel times of solute were inversely related to the application rate. 
   A secondary peak in the outflow curve, which is inconsistent with
   transport theories for a homogeneous soil, was observed in all cases. 
   This second peak is unexplained, but is conceptually consistent with the
   notion of transport in at least two pore size classes.
   An undisturbed soil core (diameter of 30 cm and length of 40 cm) was
   sprinkled at the same rates as was the soil block, using Methylene Blue
   as tracer in the last run.  Drainage hydrographs and visual examination
   of dye stains in the block indicated also at this smaller scale that
   flow and transport are controlled by preferred paths in the soil, paths
   that cannot be morphologically distinguished from the surrounding soil
   matrix.
   Theoretical explanations of processes on such hillslopes need to account
   for this fact.}},

Abstract = {{Ninety-six water samples were collected in the Xi'an area and analysed
   for D, T, O-18 and C-14.  Stable isotope contents of water samples from
   three aquifers show differences between, and mixing among, the three
   aquifers; the mixing ratio was 37.4\% of phreatic water in the first
   confined aquifer and 43.8\% of first mixed water to the second mixed
   water in the second confined aquifer.  The phreatic water comprised
   about 43.8\% x 37.4\% = 16.4\% of the second mixed water in the second
   confined aquifer.  After the tritium contents in precipitation in the
   Xi'an region had been reconstructed by a multiple cell linear regression
   method, the groundwater velocity in the first confined aquifer was
   calculated as 30-39 m year-1 from an exponential flow model.  A C-14
   piston flow model gave estimates of average flow velocity in the second
   confined aquifer of 1.14 year-1.  The runoffs in the two aquifers were
   also calculated.}},

Abstract = {{After several decades of interception studies, there are still
   considerable gaps in the understanding of wet-canopy evaporation.  Model
   development is being obstructed by the lack of techniques for the
   measurement of state and rate variables which have to be quantified for
   model validation.
   The applicability of microwave attenuation measurements for the
   determination of canopy wetness is examined.  The attenuation caused by
   a single spruce fir the laboratory and the vertical attenuation profiles
   of a Douglas fir stand were measured under dry and wet conditions.  The
   results indicate an instant increase of the attenuation upon wetting and
   a decrease owing to drip and evaporation after rainfall ceased.
   From the results, conclusions have been drawn on the design of
   instrumentation for an optimized measuring system which is suitable for
   unattended automated scanning of canopy water storage.  This system has
   been calibrated, using vertically integrated microwave attenuation
   profiles and canopy water budgets from precipitation and throughfall
   measurements.
   This system will be used for a forest hydrological study in the
   framework of the Dutch ACIFORN project, a research project on the effect
   of atmospheric deposition on Douglas fir vitality.}},

Abstract = {{The Amargosa Desert of southern Nevada, in the Basin and Range province,
   is hydraulically downgradient from Yucca Mountain, the potential site of
   a respository for high-level nuclear waste.  Groundwater flow paths and
   flow rates beneath the Amargosa Desert are controlled in part by the
   total saturated thickness and the hydraulic properties of basin-fill
   alluvial sediments.  Drillers' logs of water wells completed in alluvium
   were analyzed to help characterize the hydrogeologic framework
   underlying the Amargosa Desert.  Fractions of coarse-grained sediments,
   calculated from each of these logs, were contoured using a
   universal-kriging routine to interpolate values.  Results from a
   previous electrical sounding survey also were contoured, including the
   estimated depth to Paleozoic (?) basement rocks.  The vertical electric
   sounding results were obtained from individual depth-to-resistivity
   profiles, from which the average resistivity of the total profile and
   the resistivity of the upper 75 m were calculated.  The distribution and
   variations in average resistivity of the total depth correlated
   reasonably well with the distribution of variations in regional gravity.
   Patterns of contours of the resistivity of the upper 75 m of alluvium
   were similar to patterns of regional contours of the predominant cation
   (sodium) in ground water.  Gravity lows correspond in some places to the
   presence of lacustrine, eolian, or marsh surface deposits, which may
   function as barriers to groundwater flow.  Gravity lows also correspond
   to areas with thick basin-fill sediments, which was corroborated by
   depth-to-basement data determined from vertical electric soundings. 
   Depths to Paleozoic (?) basement rocks may be as much as 1600 m based on
   data from the resistivity survey, which were corroborated in part by
   seismic-refraction survey data.  Small variations exist in the
   percentage of the basin fill that is saturated.  The unsaturated zone is
   always < 15\% of the alluvial column.  Analysis of depth-to-water and
   hydrochemical data, in conjunction with average resistivity data for the
   upper 75 m of alluvium, suggest a hydrologic barrier near the center of
   the Amargosa Desert.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most crucial factors that affects both the accuracy and
   efficiency of a groundwater transport model is the flow simulation
   method which produces the velocity field.  This paper presents a
   boundary element technique that incorporates the zoning approach to
   allow aquifer heterogeneity.  First, the accuracy of the flow model is
   verified by comparing it with analytic solutions for well-pumping and
   injection problems.  The boundary element flow model is then coupled
   with a particle tracking procedure for advection-based transport
   simulation.  The combined model also calculates streamlines, travel
   times and breakthrough curves and is therefore a powerful tool for
   simulation and management of advection-dominated contamination problems.}},

Abstract = {{The fate of acetone in an outdoor model stream to which nitrate was
   added as a nutrient supplement was determined.  The stream, in southern
   Mississippi, U.S.A. was 234 m long.  Water was supplied to the stream by
   an artesian well at about 1.21 s-1, resulting in a mean water velocity
   of about 0.5 m min-1.  Acetone was injected continuously for 26 days
   resulting in concentrations of 20-40 mg l-1.  A nitrate solution was
   injected for 21 days resulting in an instream concentration of about 1.7
   mg l-1 at the upstream end of the stream.  Rhodamine-WT dye was used to
   determine the travel time and dispersion characteristics of the stream,
   and t-butyl alcohol was used to determine the volatilization
   characteristics.
   Volatilization controlled the fate of acetone in the model stream.  The
   lack of substantial bacterial degradation of acetone was contrary to
   expectations based on the results of laboratory degradation studies
   using model stream water enriched with nitrate.  A possible explanation
   for the lack of significant degradation in the model stream may be the
   limited 6-h residence time of the acetone in the stream.}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of unsaturated flow often require an assessment of the
   relationship between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K(u)) and
   moisture content (theta).  Measured K(u)-theta relationships for a
   well-sorted sandy soil were obtained using the instantaneous profile
   method during snowmelt recharge.  These values are compared with
   estimates from three approaches:  the Campbell equation, a modified
   version of the Campbell model that considers residual water, and the
   rate of isotopic tracer displacement during infiltration.  The modified
   Campbell model provided the best fit to the observed data, although all
   three methods overpredicted K(u).  The isotopic tracer method
   overestimated observed K(u) values by 2.6-4.5 times.  This may reflect
   the role of macropores upon hydraulic conductivities during
   infiltration, since the tracer method is employed during recharge, while
   the instantaneous profile method is generally used during drainage
   periods when macropores are nonconductive.  Whereas K(u) estimates
   derived from empirical approaches such as the Campbell model may be
   valid during conditions of drainage, the isotopic tracer model appears
   to provide more realistic conductivity values during infiltration.  The
   latter method also provides a direct means of estimating the immobile
   fraction of total soil water.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of tree spacing on rainfall interception loss has been
   investigated in stands of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr)
   spaced at intervals of 2, 4, 6 and 8 m.  The traditional volume balance
   method was used to measure throughfall, stemflow and interception loss. 
   The variation of throughfall, stemflow and interception loss between the
   four spacing treatments is analysed.  The results obtained showed that,
   on average, annual intercepton loss as a percentage of gross rainfall
   was 33, 24, 15 and 9\% in the 2, 4, 6 and 8 m spacing treatments,
   respectively.  An estimate of average boundary layer conductance was
   made by equating interception loss with evaporation rate and inverting a
   truncated form of the Penman equation.  The boundary layer conductance
   per tree increased with spacing from 0.58 m3 s-1 in the 2 m spacing
   treatment to 4.24 m3 s-1 in the 8 m spacing treatment, whereas boundary
   layer conductance per unit area declined from 0.17 to 0.07 m s-1 as the
   density of trees decreased.  The difference in interception loss between
   the spacing treatments was attributed to the difference in the boundary
   layer conductance.}},

Abstract = {{Concerns over the effects of acid rain have stimulated numerous
   hydrometric and geochemical studies on forested watersheds with an
   emphasis on stream water chemistry.  However, integrated studies are
   seriously lacking, and inferences of soil hydrogeochemical processes
   from periodic stream water chemistry may be grossly misleading.  A small
   forested subcatchment was intensively instrumented for hydrologic and
   chemical analyses to improve our understanding of the processes that
   control subsurface transport of solutes.  The timing and volume of
   subsurface flows were found to be highly dependent upon soil
   hydromorphologic properties.  Development of perched water tables was
   the predominate mechanism of subsurface flow through the lower layers
   during moderate to high flow events.  Perching of water was
   insignificant during low flow events and only partially responsible for
   lateral flow through the upper soil layers during moderate events.  The
   importance of nonequilibrium conditions during even low flow events was
   illustrated by the occurrence of saturated flow through unsaturated
   (matric potentials < - 2 kPa) soil.  The initial subsurface flow
   response of a moderate and high flow event was predominately (> 70\%)
   new water that bypassed the soil matrix.  As flows continued the
   percentage of old water increased.  Intermittent rainfall during the
   high flow event caused multiple peaks in subsurface flow with subtle
   increases in perching.  These hydrograph peaks were associated with
   decreases in the percentage of old water.  This suggests an increase in
   the portion of infiltrating water that bypasses soil matrix water via
   macropores causing increases in subsurface flows with limited growth of
   perched water tables.  The persistence of perched water tables as flow
   decreased was consistently observed.  Decreases in solute concentrations
   causing decreases in conductivity of pores was inferred as one mechanism
   for this.}},

Abstract = {{Geochemical studies of transport from watersheds to date have focused on
   stream chemistry and/or soil lysimeter data to interpret soil processes.
   Direct measurements of subsurface transport of solutes from hillslopes
   during storm events and integration with hydrometric analyses is
   seriously lacking.  This study presents subsurface transport of solutes
   (K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Al, Na, SO4, and Si) from a 0.47-ha hillslope
   subcatchment at the uppermost reach of the west fork of Walker Branch
   watershed for six storm events.  Transport of Fe and Al was primarily (>
   55\%) as suspended particles > 0.4-mu-m which resulted in a very rapid
   increase in their concentrations at the initiation of subsurface flow. 
   Weathering via particle detachment (i.e. suspended particles) was
   believed to be due to rapid infiltration of new water of low ionic
   strength which increases the diffuse double layer facilitating
   detachment of particles.  The concentration of Fe and Al in filtered
   solutions (< 0.4-mu-m) increased as flow increased and decreased during
   the recession limb of the hydrograph.  The mechanisms for the increase
   then decrease is believed to be electrostatic exchange from surfaces of
   conducting pores followed by a kinetically controlled release via
   mineral decomposition.  The most commonly observed solute transport
   pattern during storm events was an increase in concentration as flow
   rate increased, followed by a decrease in concentration during the
   recession limb of the hydrograph.  This response was due to flushing of
   solutes primarily from water-filled mesopores with macropores serving as
   conduits for solutes with limited attenuation.  Soil matrix pores (>
   6-mu-m diameter) exhibited an unlimited supply of solutes for transport
   through larger pores in that soil solution concentrations showed no
   depletion of elements during storm events.  A mass balance of solutes
   was computed for the subcatchment for 1988, and subsurface storm flow
   through the upper soil profile (< 3 m) resulted in only a minor export
   of deposited solutes.  However, subsurface saturated flow during
   individual storms were shown to be significant exporters of nutrients.}},

   river (southern France) were compared with that of ground water located
   under the intensively cultivated fields of the surrounding alluvial

   very different in the two situations.  The denitrification process in
   the former channel was identified through the natural N-15 isotope
   enrichment on residual nitrate induced by isotope fractionation and by
   the in situ measurement of gaseous nitrogen losses using the acetylene
   method.
   A recent embankment leads to the progressive drying of the waterlogged
   soils thereby decreasing the capacity of this natural riparian wetland

Abstract = {{A simplified approach to reduce a time-variant problem into a
   steady-state problem is considered by averaging the groundwater head
   over a seasonal period. This averaging is applicable to those areas
   (countries) where a year can be divided into three distinct monsoon,
   pre- and post-monsoon periods and where the annual watertable variation
   is not large compared with the saturated aquifer thickness. This scheme
   is applied to solve a two-dimensional problem using a standard finite
   difference technique of solution. The phreatic aquifer system considered
   is bounded by two reservoirs and an impervious base. It also contains a
   partially penetrating river near the centre of the aquifer. Periodic
   contribution to the phreatic aquifer from the higher head reservoir,
   groundwater recharge from river seepage, net-free surface flux and the
   total groundwater flow towards lower head reservoir are worked out.
   These terms aid in estimating the net volume of ground water that is
   available from the aquifer system in a particular seasonal period.}},

Abstract = {{A deterministic optimization model is presented for analyzing
   groundwater development and use options in an urban setting for a
   multi-year planning period.  Water quality management issues are
   considered through aquifer flow control.  Groundwater rights of
   individual water supply agencies are handled by accounting for
   groundwater flow across agency boundaries and by restricting well
   drawdowns.  A response matrix formulation is used to develop a compact,
   nonlinear optimization model.  Penalty Successive Linear Programming
   (PSLP) is used for model solutions.  Example applications of the model
   to Salt Lake County, UT are made for various demand scenarios - uniform
   demand, demand growth and drought conditions.  The results from these
   applications show that economics, water quality and water rights
   considerations, as well as the spatial and temporal distribution of
   demand are important factors in determining optimal groundwater
   development.}},

Abstract = {{The use of local scaling transformations is proposed as a framework for
   modeling the geometry, and dynamic response of subsurface flow from
   steep hillslopes.  The study site is the Upper Sheep Creek Watershed, a
   first-order sub-basin in the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed,
   southwest Idaho.  The goal of the research is to gain insight into the
   evolution of snowmelt, subsurface flow, and runoff generation in this
   rugged volcanic terrain.  In this phase of the study rescaling
   geometrically proportional (self-affine) surface and bedrock slope
   profiles provide an analytical framework for defining the shape, volume
   and dynamic changes of saturated flow for this hillslope system. 
   Rescaling self-affine hillslope trajectories along a stream reach,
   collapses the flow-domain to a unit cube.  A dynamic model for hillslope
   runoff is proposed, and implications for modeling topographic controls
   on the snowmelt process are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{The present work intends to show to what extent direct measurements of
   soil-moisture conditions, which up to now were not included in
   simulation processes, can improve discharge forecasting on a small
   catchment.  In most storage models, it has been shown that because of an
   inadequate representation of the water yield function at the basin
   scale, the simulation of discharges was made difficult, particularly
   during transition periods.  A comparison was drawn, based on a very
   simple model applied to the Orgeval catchment, between the classical
   method calculating with indirect methods the soil storage state and the
   proposed method which replaces these calculations by measurements of the
   soil-moisture conditions.  The results of the comparison show the
   superiority of the second method, the first one being unable to
   translate completely the complex reality of the rainfall-runoff
   transformation processes.  The results show the interest of including in
   a forecasting model a soil-moisture condition index which is measured
   locally at a small time-step during the hydrological cycle.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study of the effects of changing vegetative cover from
   43\% to zero on a 10\% slope demonstrates that sediment yield increases
   rapidly as vegetative cover decreases from 43 to 15\%, but with less
   than 15\% vegetative cover the rate of increase of sediment yield
   diminishes markedly.  Therefore, the relation best describing the effect
   of vegetative cover on sediment yield is neither linear nor exponential,
   and these results indicate that less than 15\% vegetative cover is
   ineffective in retarding erosion.  Therefore, efforts to reduce erosion
   by slightly increasing vegetation density in the drylands of the world
   will also be ineffective.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for determining Green-Ampt infiltration parameter values for
   tilled and crusted soils are not well established.  A two-stage method
   is developed to determine the Green and Ampt parameter values for soils
   under different management practices.  The first stage is aimed at
   calculating rainfall infiltration from rainfall and runoff data of small
   field plots which had different soil surface conditions (e.g. tillage,
   residue cover and crusting).  To determine accurate rainfall
   infiltration rates from field plots, we employed a water balance model
   which accounted for depression storage, detention storage as well as
   surface routing of runoff.  The second stage is aimed at evaluating the
   values of the Green and Ampt infiltration equation parameters by the
   linear least squares parameter estimation technique.  The Green and Ampt
   parameter values determined were the effective capillary suction at the
   wetting front and the effective hydraulic conductivity.
   The results of this study indicated that this procedure is sufficiently
   sensitive to reflect the effects of tillage, residue cover and crusting
   on infiltration data.  Raindrop impact reduced infiltration rates by
   crusting the soil surface.  However, most of the management systems that
   left about 30\% of residue cover protected the soil from raindrop impact
   as evidenced by the higher effective hydraulic conductivity.  It is
   concluded that the model developed by Green and Ampt in 1911
   satisfactorily fitted the infiltration data obtained from protected and
   crusted soil profiles.  Also, residue cover and crusting greatly
   influenced the Green and Ampt infiltration parameter values.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies of the ways in which changing flows are accommodated by
   stream channels (at-a-station hydraulic geometry) suggest that there may
   be multiple modes of adjustment-qualitatively different ways in which
   hydraulic variables respond to changes in imposed flow.  Extremal
   hypotheses for alluvial channel behavior are analyzed to determine
   whether multiple modes of adjustment (MMA) are inherent in those
   hypotheses.  After showing the fundamental equivalence of the various
   extrema, it is demonstrated that there are essentially infinite
   combinations of flow width, depth, and energy grade slope which can
   satisfy a given extremum.  It is also shown that hydraulic variables may
   not always respond to changing discharge in the expected direction. 
   These represent the necessary and sufficient conditions for the
   existence of MMA.  Data from 22 measured discharge changes at four
   different cross-sections on three different alluvial rivers show 11
   qualitatively different modes of adjustment.  This suggests that models
   of channel response to changing flow must be based on knowledge of the
   relative response time of hydraulic variables under a range of flow
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Debris flows periodically result in the loss of lives and property. 
   Engineering structures designed to control debris flows are often
   inadequate because of lack of knowledge of the magnitude of debris
   events.  The objective of this study was to develop a method that could
   be used to estimate the magnitude and frequency of debris flows.  The
   data base for the study included 29 watersheds in the Los Angeles area,
   with drainage areas < 3 mile-2.  Assuming a log-normal distribution,
   prediction equations for 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year return
   periods were developed as a function of relief ratio, hypsometric index,
   the interval between burns, and drainage area.  Principal components and
   correlation analyses were used to select the predictor variables. 
   Numerical optimization was used to calibrate the model.  The prediction
   equations can be used to estimate the magnitude of debris flows for
   ungaged watersheds where estimates are required for debris basin and
   channel design, protection of culverts and roads, land use planning, and
   zoning and establishing insurance rates.}},

Abstract = {{Debris flows cause considerable property damage and loss of life.  The
   debris basin is a widely used control alternative, for which accurate
   design methods are not available.  Thus, there is a need for a
   systematic design procedure, as well as a practical basis for
   establishing policy elements.  A design procedure that accounts for
   seasonal volumes of debris is presented.  The choice of the design
   return period and burn interval, both of which are important policy
   elements, is a function of the hazard level associated with failure. 
   The monitoring and maintenance of debris basins are also important
   policy elements.  The frequency of monitoring a basin to ensure adequate
   storage is a function of the potential hazard presented by a debris flow
   to the area downstream of the basin, as well as the precipitation, the
   frequency of burning in the watershed, and the drainage area.  A
   procedure for estimating the temporal accumulation of debris is
   presented so that public agencies will know when to monitor and dredge
   each debris basin in their jurisdiction.  The adoption of rational
   design methods and policy elements relating to debris basins should
   minimize the risk of failure of the basins.}},

Abstract = {{The main task in studying saline intrusion into an aquifer is to
   determine the position of the saline water-freshwater interface.  For a
   confined aquifer this position is determined mainly by the roof length
   of the aquifer extending under the sea.  This information can be
   obtained from fluctuations of the groundwater level caused by tidal
   fluctuations of the sea.  In this paper, a mathematical model of
   confined groudwater-level fluctuations is constructed on the condition
   that the roof length is finite.  Taking account of the continuity of
   flow between the inland and offshore aquifers allows a general formula
   to be calculated for the groundwater-level fluctuations in terms of the
   tidal fluctuations and the length of the confined aquifer under the sea.
   The actual roof length can be computed by comparison of the observed
   groundwater-level fluctuations with those computed by the formula under
   various assumptions concerning the roof length.  The method is applied
   to an aquifer on the Beihai Penisula, in the Guangxi province of China.}},

Abstract = {{Dambos are small valley wetlands commonly found on the plateau regions
   of eastern and southern Africa.  They are used for cattle grazing,
   cultivation and as a source for domestic water supply.  In Zimbabwe, up
   to 20 000 hectares of dambo land are being cultivated.  This has
   developed through the initiative of local people largely without any
   external assistance and sometimes with active official discouragement,
   justified by concern over soil degradation and water resource depletion.
   A hydrological model of a dambo is described and empirical results
   presented which suggest that, with certain limitations, irrigated dambo
   cultivation has a relatively small impact on water resources. 
   Recommended limitations are outlined.  The indication is that dambos
   offer significant potential for an expansion in irrigated cultivation. 
   This has important implications for policy makers in agriculture and
   irrigation, and for all those concerned with food security and
   nutrition.}},

Abstract = {{Recent interest in upland water quality has placed increasing importance
   on the determination of hydrological flow paths; since these cannot be
   identified uniquely from catchment-scale observations, process studies
   are required, necessarily undertaken at plot scale.  Experimental plot
   studies are reported from the Allt a'Mharcaidh catchment, Scotland, in
   which three-dimensional automatic tensiometer arrays are used to
   identify plot response, and plot sequences are considered as a basis for
   the definition of larger-scale response.
   Results are presented for five plots on two hillslope sequences.  On an
   extensive linear peaty-podzol slope, a highly heterogeneous response is
   observed.  Water table conditions occur at the profile base and,
   locally, near the surface.  Spatially localized transient mid-profile
   response suggests the generation of preferential flow paths.  At the
   base of the peaty-podzol slopes, classical expansion and contraction of
   water table conditions are observed in association with seep emergence
   at localized topographic features; however, in addition, transient
   response associated with preferential flowpaths is indicated.  Peat
   soils on more gentle slopes are generally near saturation with water
   table elevations determined by the microtopography of erosion features. 
   The bulk of the peat matrix is not responsive to storm events, but
   dynamic response is transmitted from upslope at the base of the profile.
   Catchment-scale response is hypothesized as an integration of the plot
   and hillslope-scale observations, and the implications for modelling are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Concurrent short-term measurements of evaporation from a shallow lake,

   than measuring incoming radiation nearby and modeling outgoing
   radiation.  Short-term agreement between the two evaporation
   measurements was obtained by using an energy storage term that was
   weighted to account for the area-of-influence of the eddy correlation
   sensors.  Relatively short bursts of evaporation were indicated by the
   eddy correlation sensors shortly after midnight on two of three

   different locations for a period of 34 years are linked to the
   circulation patterns.  Using the model several series of circulation
   patterns and corresponding rainfall occurrences are simulated. 
   Statistics of the simulated and the observed sequences are similar.  The
   model is also applicable for the simulation of nonstationary atmospheric

Title = {{RELATION BETWEEN INFILTRATION AND STONE COVER ON A SEMIARID HILLSLOPE,
   SOUTHERN ARIZONA}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Abstract = {{A knowledge of the spatial distribution of infiltration rates is
   essential to the application of realistic, distributed rainfall-runoff
   models in semiarid areas.  One method of determining this distribution
   is to develop a predictive equation based on a readily observable
   surface property, such as stone cover.  Previous studies of the relation
   between infiltration and stone cover on shrub-covered semiarid
   hillslopes have yielded both positive and negative correlations.  It is
   suggested that positive correlations result where infiltration
   measurements are confined to areas between large shrubs.  Negative
   correlations, on the other hand, reflect pronounced shrub-intershrub
   differences in infiltration and stone cover and are found where both
   shrub and intershrub areas are sampled.
   In this study of a semiarid hillslope in southern Arizona both shrub and
   intershrub areas are sampled, and a negative correlation is obtained
   between infiltration and stone cover.  This correlation arises from the
   fact that under shrubs fine sediments have accumulated primarily as a
   result of differential splash, whereas between shrubs such sediments
   have been selectively removed by a combination of rainsplash and
   overland flow, leaving behind a gravel lag.  Consequently, infiltration
   rates are higher under shrubs than between them, owing to the higher
   percentage of sand in the surface soil, the larger quantity of organic
   matter both within the soild and on its surface and the greater digging
   and burrowing by animals.  In addition, simulated rainfall experiments
   imply that shrubs with moderately dense canopies are more effective than
   adjacent surface gravels in dissipating the kinetic energy of raindrops
   and thereby reducing surface sealing and promoting infiltration.
   Inasmuch as the field site is typical of gentle, shrub-covered piedmont
   hillslopes over much of the Sonoran Desert, inverse relations between
   infiltration rate and stone cover are probably characteristic of such
   hillslopes and may be used to predict the spatial distribution of
   infiltration rates for inclusion in rainfall-runoff models.}},

   each identified group of gauging stations is selected to be retained in
   the rationalized network.  The station selection phase is an inherently
   heuristic process that incorporates information about the

   methodology allows the direct inclusion of user judgment into the
   station selection process in that it is possible to select more than one
   station from a group, if conditions warrant.  The technique is

Abstract = {{Trends in surface salinity at seven stations in San Francisco Bay were
   studied.  We found that annual surface salinity over the period
   1920-1986 at the ocean boundary had slightly increased and at the river
   boundary, had slightly decreased.  None of these trends were
   statistically different from zero even though upstream water use has
   nearly doubled.  However, statistically significant seasonal trends were
   found.  In most areas, salinity had increased from February through June
   and decreased at other times.  Salinity in the bay is affected primarily
   by freshwater inflow and oceanic conditions.  Seasonal salinity trends
   at stations near the freshwater boundary are probably largely owing to
   the operation of upstream water projects, which have redistributed
   freshwater between the months.  At stations near the ocean, seasonal
   salinity trends appear to be strongly influenced by offshort conditions,
   including a local rise in sea level and increased upwelling.}},

Abstract = {{A simple temperature-sensitive modification to the Green and Ampt
   infiltration equation is described; this assumes that the temperature
   dependence of the hydraulic conductivity is reciprocally equal to the
   temperature dependence of the viscosity of liquid water, and that both
   the transmission zone saturation and the wetting front matric potential
   gradient are independent of temperature.  This modified Green and Ampt
   equation is compared with ponded, isothermal infiltration experiments
   run on repacked columns of Olympic Sand and Aiken Loam at 5, 25, and
   60-degrees-C.  Experimental results showed increases in infiltration
   rates of at least 300\% between 5 and 60-degrees-C for both soil
   materials, with subsequent increases in cumulative infiltration of even
   greater magnitudes for the loam.  There is good agreement between
   measured and predicted initial infiltration rates at 25-degrees-C for
   both soil materials, yet at 60-degrees-C, the predicted results
   overestimate initial infiltration rates for the sand and underestimate
   initial rates for the loam.  Measurements of the wetting depth vs.
   cumulative infiltration indicate that the transmission zone saturation
   increased with increasing temperature for both soil materials.  In spite
   of this increased saturation with temperature, the final infiltration
   rates at both 25 and 60-degrees-C were predicted accurately using the
   modified Green and Ampt equation.  This suggests that increased
   saturation occurred primarily in dead-end pore spaces, so that

Abstract = {{A coupled soil water and heat model was used to study the influence of
   soil frost and snow on infiltration and drainage flow in an agricultural
   field in central Sweden.  An analogy between freezing/thawing and
   drying/wetting was assumed for the soil frost submodel.  Model
   simulations were evaluated against measurements of total soil water
   content, unfrozen water content, soil temperature and drainage
   water-flow.  The influences of soil frost and spatial variation in snow
   cover were studied by simulation of possible extreme situations in the
   field.  The model accurately described the dynamics of soil temperature
   and water contents; however, infiltration and field drainage flow were
   considerably underestimated and delayed by about three weeks under
   frozen conditions.  A model simulation, discounting the effects of soil
   frost, overestimated the drain response.  An attempt at simulating the
   field variation in snow cover by assuming possible `sink points' for
   snowmelt, explained part of the deviations between simulated and
   measured drain flows.  A basis for a new model formulation of the
   infiltration and percolation processes in frozen soil is proposed in
   which two water-flow domains are assumed, one low-flow domain in the
   fine pores, smaller than those filled with ice, and one high-flow domain
   in the large air-filled pores.  This allows the simulation of rapid
   infiltration in large ice-free pores and drainage flow under frozen
   conditions as well as the resulting redistribution of ice from smaller
   to larger pores.}},

Abstract = {{The orthogonal Walsh series are proposed as an effective model to
   account for periodicities in observed hydrologic series. Their
   combinations with the Kalman filter lead to a real-time prediction
   procedure of the state variables which are monthly hydrologic variables.
   General formulations of adaptive parameter and state estimates are
   presented and subsequently their application is performed for monthly
   flow and rainfall volume sequences. The Walsh series are attractive
   because of their piecewise linearity over controllable finite periods,
   their orthogonality and their symmetry, in addition to their simplicity
   in the basic calculations, which are additions and subtractions. The
   method has been applied to monthly stream flow data from Turkey and the
   U.S.A., and monthly rainfall data from Saudi Arabia as a representative
   of extremely arid zones. Comparison with the already available results
   indicates that the Walsh functions lead to better adaptive predictions
   than the Fourier series when combined with the Kalman procedure.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrological response of a well-structured hillslope soil under
   pasture is described.  In this soil, during the winter recharge period,
   macropores provide pathways for water movement which effectively by-pass
   the soil matrix.  In consequence, a perched water table does not develop
   within the soil profile.  New input water is able to penetrate rapidly
   through the macropore system within the clayey B horizon to the
   soil/bedrock interface.  A highly transient `water table' is then
   established within the macropore system and overland flow commences only
   when the capacity of this system is exceeded.
   During the summer, this flow pattern changes and, although the soil
   might be expected to absorb water more readily than during winter,
   overland flow is the dominant runoff mechanism.
   The macropore-matrix dichotomy of the soil hydraulic properties is
   characterized in situ using auger hole and disc permeaters.  The
   measured soil hydraulic properties are used in a finite element model to
   predict independently the subsurface runoff response during the winter
   recharge period and to check the adequacy of a throughflow collection
   system.  The model predictions are in reasonable agreement with measured
   water tables during drainage.}},

Abstract = {{A chemical hydrograph separation can be used to study runoff processes
   on a watershed scale provided the soil kinetics of the geochemical
   tracer are well documented.  To separate streamflow into surface (SF)
   and subsurface flow (SSF), the supply of the tracer from the soil should
   be uniform throughout the soil profile and independent of the residence
   time of the soil/groundwater.  This paper examines the use of two
   weathering products, dissolved silica and magnesium, for separating
   spring runoff into SF and SSF in small headwater streams on the Canadian
   Shield.  Field observations and leaching experiments in the laboratory
   suggested that both tracers were released very rapidly from the podzolic
   soils.  Silica allowed a well-defined separation of streamflow into SF
   and SSF since it is absent in melt/rain water and its concentration
   varies little throughout the soil profile.  Magnesium was used in those
   streams with wetlands when silica was not behaving conservatively.  Both
   geochemical tracers suggested higher contributions of SSF to total
   spring runoff ( > 90\%) than estimates (almost-equal-to 72\%) based on
   the stable isotope deuterium.  This difference may result from laterally
   flowing soil-water that did not mix with the phreatic/groundwater
   reservoir.}},

Abstract = {{The finite-element method is often used for the solution of complicated
   partial differential equations.  The method is especially effective for
   two- and three-dimensional (2-D, 3-D) problems.  Its application to
   one-dimensional (1-D) problems is usually considered to be unsuitable. 
   However, using the finite-element method for the Saint Venant equations
   one can obtain a solution algorithm equally effective as the best known
   difference schemes.
   In this paper the method is applied to the solution of the Saint Venant
   equations.  Use of the method eliminates oscillations of type
   `2-DELTA-x', thus assuring a smooth and stable solution.  An example
   from a real water channel network is analysed and the results obtained
   are compared with observations.}},

   sediments that can be measured in the four wavelength bands used by the
   Indian Remote Sensing Satellite LISS-1.  The spectral response of
   sediment-laden water is more affected by particle size than by the
   concentration of suspended sediment; the spectral response depends upon
   the colour, type, size and mineral composition of the sediments.  When
   the concentration of sediment exceeds 90 or 140 mgl-1 (for black and

Abstract = {{Travel times of crests of runoff events in rivers are determined from
   records of standard hydrometric stations which are located in series. 
   For all the studied reaches, travel time decreases as discharge
   increases.  Their relationship is formulated by use of a linear
   regression on logarithmic transformed data.  The parameters of this
   relationship are regressed on the length and the slope of the reach and
   on the circularity of the watershed of the upstream station.  The
   results for the individual reaches are found to be valid for application
   for either the upstream or the downstream station, but a regional
   formula can be derived only for the upstream stations.}},

Abstract = {{Draintiles (impervious lengths of pipe laid end to end with gaps between
   adjacent sections to permit water entry) are commonly used in the
   drainage of agricultural lands and airport runways, and are employed to
   ensure foundational stability of many structures.  The rate of flow into
   a line of draintiles buried in water-saturated soil depends upon the
   width and spacing of the gaps between the tiles as well as other
   parameters.  A formula is developed in this paper for the general,
   non-axisymmetric case to determine the flow rate into a single gap.  The
   differences between the formula developed in this paper and that
   developed earlier are discussed in terms of their derivation.  A
   numerical example provides details on the essential differences between
   the two formulae.}},

Abstract = {{Many water agencies in California and the rest of the United States
   utilize sequences of wrapped historic hydrology rather than synthetic
   streamflows in their simulation models. The wrapped historic procedure
   is also known as the index-sequential method. This paper compares
   results from an annual regulation model of the Colorado River system
   which used both historic hydrologic sequences generated by the
   index-sequential method, and autoregressive, order 1 (AR(1))
   synthetically generated streamflows as inputs. The synthetic AR(1) log
   normal model also included parameter uncertainty. Reservoir storage
   exceedance probabilities developed for Lake Powell and Lake Mead from a
   32-year simulation show that AR(1) model generated flows yield slightly
   higher storage levels at 50\% exceedance. This is in part the result of
   the parameter estimation procedure of the AR(1) model, and also to the
   fact that AR(1) models do not reproduce critical period severity with
   the same frequency as that evidenced in the index sequential method.
   Thus, the index-sequential method appears to be a conservative approach
   for average storage predictions. However, for predictions involving
   higher exceedance probabilities, (i.e. the tails of the distribution)
   synthetic streamflows may be more appropriate.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative rainfall forecasts obtained from interpretation of radar
   data can be of great interest in urban hydrology, provided their
   reliability is known in real time.  The aim of this study was to examine
   the feasibility of an a priori estimation of forecast reliability from
   characteristics of rainfall areas and atmospheric vertical structure. 
   The first step has been to design a method to check the relevance of a
   criterion of forecasting quality to a particular application of the
   forecasts.  This method was applied to the case of real-time control of
   a drainage network in a suburban area of Paris, and led to the
   definition of a new quality criterion, consistent with the user's
   utility function.  Potential predictors of forecasting quality were then
   defined, to be calculated in real time from radar and rawinsonde data. 
   In the final step, statistical and heuristic techniques, applied to a
   learning set of examples taken from 46 rainfall events, provided
   decision rules which can be used in real time to estimate the quality of
   radar forecasts.  Although these rules are valid only in a specific
   operational context, the methodology is general, and can be transferred
   to other forecasting problems in hydrology, as well as in other domains.}},

Abstract = {{The boundary-fitted grid method, which transforms a complicated
   computational domain into a rectangular domain, is applied for the
   moisture and solute transport problems in the unsaturated soil layer of
   an S-shaped model hillslope.  In the transformed domain, the fundamental
   equations of moisture and solute transport (i.e. the Richards equation
   and the Fickian equation) can be easily discretized into the
   finite-difference form.
   For three types of rainfall pattern (a unit rainfall, two-unit
   successive rainfalls and two unit rainfalls with a lag between them),
   hydrographs of total (pre-event and event water) and event water
   discharges, contour lines of soil moisture, pressure and total hydraulic
   head distributions, and flow velocity vectors are compared.  For a
   relatively thick soil layer or for a relatively light rainfall, the
   capillary fringe effect plays an important role, whereas for a
   relatively thin soil layer or for a relatively heavy rainfall, overland
   flow from a variable source area is superimposed on the
   capillary-fringe-type runoff.}},

Abstract = {{Most theoretical and experimental investigations of solute transport
   involve one-dimensional problems (i.e. soil column studies), whereas in
   reality many soil pollution problems concern transport and flow in more
   than one dimension.  This study investigates two-dimensional transport,
   with emphasis on the contribution of transverse dispersion to solute
   transport.  Three problems were studied with a finite element code.  The
   first problem involved one-dimensional flow parallel to the interface of
   two layers with differing pore-water velocity.  The early arrival of the
   solute at the end of the low-permeability layer and the increase in
   solute spreading for both layers, as a result of transverse dispersion,
   were demonstrated.  The two other problems concerned transport of a
   pollutant from a point source and a diffuse source, respectively,
   located at the soil surface.  The magnitude of the transverse dispersion
   coefficient influenced the region to which the pollution extended as
   well as the intensity of the pollution.}},
