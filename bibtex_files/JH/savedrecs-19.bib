Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to estimate the unconditional sample
   uncertainty of observed streamflows and streamflows simulated from a
   hydrologic model (MISBA) for the Fraser River Basin (FRB) and the
   Athabasca River Basin (ARB) of Canada under historic conditions and
   under future conditions simulated by General Circulation Models (GCMs).
   For each basin, the multifractal properties of 54 simulated hydrographs
   based on the predictions of seven GCMs and four climate scenarios over
   three 30-year periods of the 21st century were evaluated and used to
   generate extended artificial time series by the randomized generalized
   multifractal cascade model. Uncertainty estimates derived from this
   multifractal approach were compared with classical statistics, Hurst
   exponent, and autocorrelation methods. The multifractal approach
   resulted in greater departures from statistical independence, higher
   skewness, and a wider range of flows over a 30-year time scale than the
   other methods. Under climate change, the multifractal strength of
   streamflows of FRB increased with temperature as the snow fed character
   of the basin weakened, but in the colder ARB, a decrease in multifractal
   strength resulted under rising temperatures because of declined snow
   packs. The estimated unconditional sample uncertainty was compared with
   uncertainty associated with model and emissions scenario selection.
   Among four major sources of uncertainty, uncertainty associated with two
   different hydrologic models (MISBA and SAC-SMA) and global emission
   patterns in the 21st century were relatively small (20\% or less) even
   though for the latter, the range of SRES climate scenarios may not be
   representative of future economy and the seven GCMs may not accurately
   represent actual physical processes. The uncertainties associated with
   multifractal variation were the largest, on the order of +/- 50\%. (C)

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of nutrient loads in rivers and streams is critical
   for many applications including determination of sources of nutrient
   loads in watersheds, evaluating long-term trends in loads, and
   estimating loading to downstream waterbodies. Since in many cases
   nutrient concentrations are measured on a weekly or monthly frequency,
   there is a need to estimate concentration and loads during periods when
   no data is available. The objectives of this study were to: (i) document
   the performance of a multiple regression model to predict loads of
   nitrate and total phosphorus (TP) in Iowa rivers and streams: (ii)
   determine whether there is any systematic bias in the load prediction
   estimates for nitrate and TP; and (iii) evaluate streamflow and
   concentration factors that could affect the load prediction efficiency.
   A commonly cited rating curve regression is utilized to estimate
   riverine nitrate and TP loads for rivers in Iowa with watershed areas
   ranging from 17.4 to over 34,600 km(2). Forty-nine nitrate and 44 TP
   datasets each comprising 5-22 years of approximately weekly to monthly
   concentrations were examined. Three nitrate data sets had sample
   collection frequencies averaging about three samples per week. The
   accuracy and precision of annual and long term riverine load prediction
   was assessed by direct comparison of rating curve load predictions with
   observed daily loads. Significant positive bias of annual and long term
   nitrate loads was detected. Long term rating curve nitrate load
   predictions exceeded observed loads by 25\% or more at 33\% of the 49
   measurement sites. No bias was found for TP load prediction although
   15\% of the 44 cases either underestimated or overestimate observed
   long-term loads by more than 25\%. The rating curve was found to poorly
   characterize nitrate and phosphorus variation in some rivers. Published

Abstract = {{Soil infiltrability, or infiltration capacity, is the rate at which
   water penetrates into the soil at a rate directly controlled by soil
   factors alone. The infiltrability is of great importance in
   understanding and managing hydrological processes, crop water supply,
   irrigation, and soil erosion. The infiltration dynamics measured with
   the run off-on-out (ROOO) method follows the changes in infiltrability
   during the infiltration process under rainfall conditions. In this
   study, the ROOO method was used to quantitatively measure the soil
   infiltrability under three rainfall intensities (20, 40 and 60 mm/h) and
   three antecedent soil moisture contents (2.6\%, 10.4\% and 19.5\%,
   equivalent to 7.5\% (air-dry), 30\% and 60\% of field capacity,
   respectively, of a clay loam soil. The soil infiltrability determined by
   the ROOO method decreased with increase in initial soil water content,
   due to the lower hydraulic gradient at the wetting front. Surface seal
   formation due to raindrop impact had a significant influence on soil
   infiltrability and was related to the soil water content. The faster
   wetting rate of drier soil under higher rainfall intensities, or when
   using the double-ring infiltrometer for comparison, caused severe
   aggregate breakdown to promote surface sealing, and significant decrease
   in soil infiltrability. Cumulative infiltration increased rapidly at the
   beginning of the infiltration process and then increased approximately
   linearly with time as the infiltration rate approached to constant. The
   rate of increase in cumulative infiltration was less under higher
   initial soil water contents, especially in the initial rainfall stage.
   Moreover, lower rainfall intensity resulted in higher infiltration rates
   and greater cumulative infiltration. The soil infiltrability processes
   measured with the ROOO method were fitted better by Kostiakov, Horton
   and Philip infiltration models than those measured by the double-ring
   infiltrometer method. The ROOO method provided reliable data for the
   entire infiltration process without the limitations of conventional
   rainfall simulation during the initial phase or of the drawbacks of the
   double-ring infiltrometer method. The results will have introductory
   meanings to further studies along this line. (C) 2010 Published by

Abstract = {{This paper presents modeling analyses of long term infiltration and
   tracer tests in fractured tuffs at Yucca Mountain, NV, USA. The
   experiments were conducted on a 20 m thick tuff section in a flyover
   formed by two exploratory tunnels. The infiltration test last for 870
   days. Both measured infiltration and seepage show significant temporal
   and spatial variations. The tracer test used inorganic tracers (I-, Br-,
   F-) and organic tracers (fluorobenzoic acids) released 559 days after
   the infiltration test started. Leaching from dry salts from fracture
   walls was found to have affected tracer breakthroughs. The unsaturated
   flow was evaluated by optimizing 45 parameter values in a
   three-dimensional model, which accounts for fracture-matrix interaction
   and heterogeneous hydraulic properties in a column-based scheme. The
   field data are valuable asset to evaluate the modeling approaches for
   fractured rocks and the relative importance of the matrix diffusion
   process. Results show that matrix diffusion is an important process for
   transport, and that effective matrix-diffusion coefficients at the
   field-scale are larger than those at the laboratory-scale for the
   solutes. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{By combining laboratory and field experiments we study the release of
   water from above a falling water table and the implications this has on
   pumping test analysis and prediction of stream depletion. Undisturbed
   core samples from the field site were used in laboratory experiments to
   measure drainage responses to water-table drawdown. The responses can be
   sufficiently modeled by estimating the specific yield and five
   exponential time constants of a Moench/Boulton type model of delayed
   drainage. The average specific yield is thus estimated to 0.24 which is
   in agreement with previous small scale and large scale estimates. In
   addition two pumping tests were conducted near the stream. The drawdown
   analysis was made using a 3D numerical groundwater flow model
   facilitating use of the Moench/Boulton type boundary condition at the
   water table. The drawdown observations were fitted by calibrating two
   alternative models: one simulating the release of water at the water
   table as instantaneous; the other simulating the release of water as
   delayed. Comparing the calibration results for the two alternative
   models showed that they fit the drawdown observations nearly equally
   well, and most estimated parameter values are realistic and nearly
   identical. However, estimation of the specific yield is found to be
   sensitive to whether drainage is modeled as instantaneous or as delayed.
   In the first case the estimated specific yield is about half of the
   estimate from the core experiments and of the previous estimates; in the
   second case the estimate (0.17) is in better agreement with core and
   previous estimates (0.24). The analysis indicates that relatively fast
   drainage, and the existence of two drawdown dependent sources of
   groundwater recharge (the storage and the stream), complicates pumping
   test design to obtain unique parameter estimation. The analysis supports
   that an essential factor in parameter estimation by pumping test
   analysis for (at least some) unconfined aquifers is the use of a model
   that accounts for time-varying drainage from the vadose zone. Finally,
   when predicting stream depletion beyond 1 day of pumping it is
   acceptable in the present case to use a model simulating drainage as
   instantaneous if unbiased parameter estimates are used. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The water movement in irrigation districts, especially for paddy rice
   cultivation, is characterized by complicated factors. Soil and Water
   Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a popular tool for understanding the
   hydroagronomic processes. However, it fails to simulate the hydrological
   processes and crop yields in paddy rice areas. In this study, we develop
   the SWAT model by incorporating new processes for irrigation and
   drainage. The evapotranspiration process in paddy fields is simulated on
   the basis of water storage conditions, and a controlling irrigation
   scheme is introduced to manage the irrigation and drainage operations.
   The irrigation function of local water storages, such as ponds and
   reservoirs, is extended for these storages in order to provide water in
   a timely manner to paddy fields. Moreover, an agronomic model is
   incorporated to estimate crop yields when available data sets are not
   satisfactory. The model is tested in Zhanghe Irrigation District, China.
   The simulated runoff matches well to the measurements and the results
   indicate the developed model is preferable to the original edition of
   SWAT. The estimate of the paddy rice yield is acceptable and the
   dynamics of water balance components approximately characterize the
   state of water movements in paddy fields. Therefore, the developed
   framework for SWAT is practical and capable of representing the
   hydrological processes in this irrigation district. Further work is
   still needed to more broadly test the model in areas with paddy rice
   cultivation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing evidences of climate change in the prairie region, there
   is an urgent need to understand the future climate and the responses of
   small prairie wetlands. This study integrated two regional climate
   models (RCMs), two weather generators and a distributed hydrological
   model to examine uncertainties in hydrological responses to climate
   change in the Assiniboia watershed, Canada. Comparing to baseline
   conditions (1971-2000), annual water yield and evapotranspiration in the
   period of 2041-2070 were generally unchanged, while annual reservoir
   storage was generally reduced. However, projected hydrological regimes
   were less consistent at monthly level, particularly for March and July.
   Such uncertainties in simulated hydrological responses were derived from
   the implementations of different integrated downscaling methods,
   reflecting our imperfect knowledge of the future climate. We identified
   a warming temperature trend from climatic projections, but had less
   confidence in the future pattern of precipitation. Uncertainties in
   integrated downscaling were primarily derived from the choice of RCM,
   and were amplified through the incorporation of different weather
   generators. Results of any climate change study based on only one RCM
   and/or one weather generator should be interpreted with caution, and the
   ensemble framework should be advised to generate a comprehensive vision
   of the future climate. This study demonstrated that the incorporation of
   precipitation occurrence change contributed to a full translation of RCM
   outputs, but also introduced additional uncertainty. A balance is thus
   desired between the information loss and the additional uncertainty in
   order to effectively utilize RCM outputs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Trend analysis has been an important tool in assessing hydrological
   process. However, statistical approaches employed for trend analysis
   frequently assume independence in hydrological time series. To satisfy
   the independence assumption, the hydrological series of interest are
   usually summarized to large scale data (e.g. annual) for long-term
   trend. To assess intra-annual variability, the hydrological series are
   summarized to several periods within a year (e.g. season or month) and
   then analyzed separately for each period over different years (e.g. each
   month over different years). Unfortunately, for those seasonal and
   monthly data, the trend analysis must be conducted separately for
   individual periods in order to avoid data dependence. However, the
   setting of periodic models cannot guarantee the smoothness in model
   coefficients from period to period (e.g. month to month). In this paper,
   we develop a trend analysis tool by including a period component in the
   method. By doing this, the data dependence and seasonality will not be
   issues but become advantages as information gain for each period. The
   proposed method treats the change in hydrological series as the
   interaction between long-term trend and seasonal variation. The
   functional coefficient model with a periodic component is used for model
   development. Unlike the traditional functional coefficient models which
   extend the threshold regression model, our functional coefficient model
   with periodic components enjoys smoothing changes from year to year. As
   case studies, the models are applied to Australian streamflows in three
   typical climate conditions. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by

Abstract = {{We have developed two nonlinear time-series models for predicting
   groundwater level (GWL) fluctuations using artificial neural networks
   (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). The models were applied to
   GWL prediction of two wells at a coastal aquifer in Korea. Among the
   possible variables (past GWL, precipitation, and tide level) for an
   input structure, the past GWL was the most effective input variable for
   this study site. Tide level was more frequently selected as an input
   variable than precipitation. The results of the model performance show
   that root mean squared error (RMSE) values of ANN models are lower than
   those of SVM in model training and testing stages. However, the overall
   model performance criteria of the SVM are similar to or even better than
   those of the ANN in model prediction stage. The generalization ability
   of a SVM model is superior to an ANN model for input structures and lead
   times. The uncertainty analysis for model parameters detects an
   equifinality of model parameter sets and higher uncertainty for ANN
   model than SVM in this case. These results imply that the model-building
   process should be carefully conducted, especially when using ANN models
   for GWL forecasting in a coastal aquifer. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The magnitude and seasonal dynamics of evapotranspiration (ET) over a
   temperate desert steppe in Inner Mongolia, China, were investigated
   during a growing season (from 1st May to 15th October 2008) using the
   eddy covariance (EC) technique. Diurnal variations of latent heat flux
   (LE) at different phenological stages showed similar patterns with the
   peak value around noon. The sensible heat flux dominated the latent heat
   flux at midday during the whole growing season. Seasonal variation in ET
   followed closely the variation in soil water content (SWC) and leaf area
   index (LAI). The maximum daily ET rate was 3.8 mm day(-1). Cumulative ET
   during the study period estimated directly by EC method was 150.9 mm,
   exceeding the precipitation (PPT) received at the site during the same
   period (133.0 mm) by 13.4\%. The daily crop coefficient (Kc, calculated
   as the ratio of the measured ET (from the EC system) to the reference ET
   (from the Penman-Monteith model)) also showed a distinct seasonal
   pattern, however its value on average was considerable lower (0.17)
   during the measurement period than the results reported from other
   grasslands, suggesting that this steppe was strongly affected by the
   deficit of available water. SWC was the most important environmental
   factor controlling ET in this steppe. The correlation analysis between
   daily Kc and its major environmental controls indicated that SWC,
   relative humidity (RH), and net radiation (Rn) were the major
   explanatory variables for daily Kc. Daily Kc showed a linear increase
   with SWC and Rn, and an exponential increase with RH. Thus, a daily Kc
   model would be developed as a function of SWC, RH, and Rn. An empirical
   daily ET model derived from the FAO 56 crop coefficient approach was
   developed based on this daily Kc model and the Penman-Monteith model.
   This ET model was validated by the data from the growing season in 2009,
   and showed a good consistency between the simulated and the measured ET
   values. Based on the developed ET model, an alternative ET model with
   the variable of SWC replaced by PPT was established, which may have the
   advantage of ET estimation under PPT more easily available than SWC. (C)

Abstract = {{We consider estimating the total load from frequent flow data but less
   frequent concentration data. There are numerous load estimation methods
   available, some of which are captured in various online tools. However,
   most estimators are subject to large biases statistically, and their
   associated uncertainties are often not reported. This makes
   interpretation difficult and the estimation of trends or determination
   of optimal sampling regimes impossible to assess. In this paper, we
   first propose two indices for measuring the extent of sampling bias, and
   then provide steps for obtaining reliable load estimates that minimizes
   the biases and makes use of informative predictive variables. The key
   step to this approach is in the development of an appropriate predictive
   model for concentration. This is achieved using a generalized
   rating-curve approach with additional predictors that capture unique
   features in the flow data, such as the concept of the first flush, the
   location of the event on the hydrograph (e.g. rise or fall) and the
   discounted flow. The latter may be thought of as a measure of
   constituent exhaustion occurring during flood events. Forming this
   additional information can significantly improve the predictability of
   concentration, and ultimately the precision with which the pollutant
   load is estimated. We also provide a measure of the standard error of
   the load estimate which incorporates model, spatial and/or temporal
   errors. This method also has the capacity to incorporate measurement
   error incurred through the sampling of flow. We illustrate this approach
   for two rivers delivering to the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland,
   Australia. One is a data set from the Burdekin River, and consists of
   the total suspended sediment (TSS) and nitrogen oxide (NO(x)) and gauged
   flow for 1997. The other dataset is from the Tully River, for the period
   of July 2000 to June 2008. For NO(x) Burdekin, the new estimates are
   very similar to the ratio estimates even when there is no relationship
   between the concentration and the flow. However, for the Tully dataset,
   by incorporating the additional predictive variables namely the
   discounted flow and flow phases (rising or recessing), we substantially
   improved the model fit, and thus the certainty with which the load is
   estimated. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

   implications for water supply}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires burn extensive forest areas around the world each year. In
   many locations, fire-prone forest catchments are utilised for the supply
   of potable water to small communities up to large cities. Following
   wildfire, increased erosion rates and changes to runoff generation and
   pollutant sources may greatly increase fluxes of sediment, nutrients and
   other water quality constituents, potentially contaminating water
   supplies. Most research to date has focused on suspended sediment
   exports and concentrations after wildfire. Reported first year post-fire
   suspended sediment exports varied from 0.017 to 50 t ha(-1) year(-1)
   across a large range of catchment sizes (0.021-1655 km(2)). This
   represented an estimated increase of 1-1459 times unburned exports.
   Maximum reported concentrations of total suspended solids in streams for
   the first year after fire ranged from 11 to similar to 500,000 mg L-1.
   Similarly, there was a large range in first year post-fire stream
   exports of total N (1.1-27 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) and total P (0.03-3.2 kg
   ha(-1) year(-1)), representing a multiple change of 0.3-431 times
   unburned, while NO3- exports of 0.04-13.0 kg ha(-1) year(-1) (3-250
   times unburned) have been reported. NO3-. NO2-, and NH3/NH4+
   concentrations in streams and lakes or reservoirs may increase after
   wildfire but appear to present a generally low risk of exceeding
   drinking water guidelines. Few studies have examined post-fire exports
   of trace elements. The limited observations of trace element
   concentrations in streams after wildfire found high levels (well over
   guidelines) of Fe, Mn, As, Cr, Al, Ba, and Pb, which were associated
   with highly elevated sediment concentrations. In contrast, Cu, Zn, and
   Hg were below or only slightly above guideline values. Elevated Na+, Cl-
   and SO42- solute yields have been recorded soon after fire, while
   reports of concentrations of these constituents were mostly confined to
   coniferous forest areas in North America, where maximum sampled values
   were well below recommended limits. Likewise, reported wildfire effects
   on dissolved organic carbon were generally minor and elevated
   concentrations largely reflected background conditions. Available
   cyanide concentrations in small streams may approach levels of concern
   soon after fire, but increases are likely to be of short duration.
   Post-fire concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in streams
   have been found to increase but remained within the recommended limit.
   Large increases in exports and concentrations of some constituents after
   wildfire indicate the potential for impacts on water supply from forest
   catchments. In response, various water treatment measures may be
   required and in the absence of adequate treatment facilities or
   alternative sources, water supplies may be vulnerable to disruption. (C)
